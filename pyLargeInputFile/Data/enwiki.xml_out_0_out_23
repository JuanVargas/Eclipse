[[Jeff Munn]] is a backup radio play-by-play announcer; he served as the regular public address announcer at [[Chase Field]] in the early days of the franchise. He is well-known to many Phoenix area sports fans, having also served as the public address announcer for the Suns at America West Arena (now [[US Airways Center]]) in the 1990s. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women's basketball.

On November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] since 2002, [[Daron Sutton]], would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton is considered one of the best of the younger generation of baseball broadcasters. His signature chants include &quot;lets get some runs&quot; when the D'Backs trail in late innings. Sutton's father is [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher and current [[Atlanta Braves]] broadcaster [[Don Sutton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mlb3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061101&amp;content_id=1729190&amp;vkey=pr_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|title=MLB.com|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Diamondback and Chicago Cub [[Mark Grace]] and former Major League [[knuckleball]] pitcher [[Tom Candiotti]] were the Diamondbacks primary color analysts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Former Diamondback player (and current Diamondbacks minority owner) [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] also does color commentary on occasion, as does former [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] and [[NBC]] broadcast legend [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.]]., a longtime Phoenix-area resident and father of [[Joe Garagiola, Jr.]], the first GM of the Diamondbacks (as head of the Maricopa County Sports Authority in the early 1990s, Garagiola, Jr. was one of the primary people involved in Phoenix obtaining a Major League Baseball franchise).

The Diamondbacks announced in July 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070713&amp;content_id=2084028&amp;vkey=pr_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|title=FSN Arizona to become exclusive TV home for the D'Backs starting next season &amp;#124; Dbacks.com: Official Info|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for the 2008 season, all regionally broadcast Diamondback TV games will be shown exclusively on [[FSN Arizona]]; and a few could possibly be shown on the national [[Major League Baseball on Fox|MLB on Fox]] telecasts. FSN Arizona is currently seen in 2.8&amp;nbsp;million households in Arizona &amp; New Mexico. The previous flagship station, since the inaugural 1998 season, was [[KTVK]], a popular over-the-air independent station in Phoenix.

In 2009, Mark Grace and Darron Sutton are still tagged as the main broadcasters of the Diamondbacks. However, for pre-game and post-game shows on Fox Sports Arizona, former big-league closer [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]] will be an analyst, according to an announcement made by FS Arizona's Executive Producer Mike Roth.

The flagship Spanish language radio station is [[KSUN|KSUN AM 1400]] with Miguel Quintana and Arthuro Ochoa as the regular announcers. They are sometimes joined by Richard Saenz or Oscar Soria.

Games were televised in Spanish on [[KPHE-LP]]—with Oscar Soria and Jerry Romo as the announcers—but this arrangement ended prior to the 2009 season due to the team switching fully to [[Fox Sports Arizona]] and the lack of carriage of KHPE-LP on the Cox cable system.&lt;ref name=&quot;azc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2009/01/22/20090122spt-dbackstv.html|title=No Spanish TV broadcasts for D'Backs|publisher=Azcentral.com|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aesthetics''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled]] '''æsthetics''' or '''esthetics''') is a branch of [[philosophy]] dealing with the nature of [[beauty]], art, and taste, and with the creation and appreciation of [[beauty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetics Definition 1 of ''aesthetics''] from the [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more scientifically defined as the study of [[senses|sensory]] or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called [[judgment]]s of [[sentiment]] and [[taste (sociology)|taste]].&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. &quot;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]&quot;, ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as &quot;critical reflection on [[art]], [[culture]] and [[nature]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlisna.org/artdoc/vol18/iss2/01.pdf Review] by Tom Riedel ([[Regis University]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
It was derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''αἰσθητικός'' (''aisthetikos'', meaning &quot;esthetic, sensitive, sentient&quot;), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning &quot;I perceive, feel, sense&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aesthetic Definition of ''aesthetic''] from the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;aesthetics&quot; was appropriated and coined with new meaning in the [[German language|German]] form ''Æsthetik'' (modern spelling ''Ästhetik'') by [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in 1735.

==History of aesthetics==
[[Image:Poseidon.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bronze sculpture]], thought to be either [[Poseidon]] or [[Zeus]], [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] ]]

===Ancient aesthetics===
We have examples of [[pre-historic art]], but they are rare, and the context of their production and use is not very clear, so we can little more than guess at the aesthetic doctrines that guided their production and interpretation.

[[Ancient art]] was largely, but not entirely, based on the eight great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[China]] and Mayan. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Greece had the most influence on the development of aesthetics in the West. This period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of corresponding skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. Furthermore, in many Western and Eastern cultures alike, traits such as body hair are rarely depicted in art that addresses physical beauty.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} More in contrast with this Greek-Western aesthetic taste is the genre of [[grotesque]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grotesque'' entry in Kelly 1998, pp.338-341&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in and of themselves. [[Plato]] felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, [[harmony]], and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] found that the universal elements of beauty were order, [[symmetry]], and definiteness.

===Islamic aesthetics===
[[Islamic art]] is not, properly speaking, an art pertaining to religion only. The term &quot;[[Islam]]ic&quot; refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art created in an [[Muslim culture|Islamic culture]] or in an Islamic context. It would also be a mistake to assume that all [[Muslim]]s are in agreement on the use of art in religious observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to religious precepts.  Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some [[Kalam|Islamic theologians]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, ISBN 0131934554 pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islam, human works of art are inherently flawed compared to the work of God; thus, it is believed by many that to attempt to depict in a realistic form any animal or person is insolence to God. This tendency has had the effect of narrowing the field of artistic possibility to such forms of art as [[Arabesque]], [[mosaic]], [[Islamic calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture]], as well as more generally any form of abstraction that can claim the status of non-representational art.

The limited possibilities have been explored by artists as an outlet to artistic expression, and has been cultivated to become a positive style and tradition, emphasizing the decorative function of art, or its religious functions via non-representational forms such as Geometric patterns, floral patterns, and [[arabesques]].

Human or animal depiction is generally forbidden altogether in Islamic cultures because it is said to lead to sculptural pieces which then leads to worship of that sculpture or &quot;idol&quot;. Human portrayals can be found in early Islamic cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. Human representation for the purpose of worship that is uniformly considered [[idolatry]] as forbidden in ''[[Sharia]]'' law. There are many [[depictions of Muhammad]], [[Mohammed|Islam's chief prophet]], in historical Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rpUuqLPPKK4C&amp;dq=wijdan&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QXySmKzsy6&amp;sig=a9V6tTTfsrTT5Ex01QGnwrL7XYY ''The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries''], [[Wijdan Ali]], American Univ in Cairo Press, December 10, 1999, ISBN 9774244761&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf  ''From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's(s.a.w) Portrayal from 13th century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th century Ottoman Art''], [[Wijdan Ali]], [http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/EJOS-1.html EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies)], volume IV, issue 7, p. 1-24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The calligraphic arts grew out of an effort to devote oneself to the study of the Quran. By patiently transcribing each word of the text, the writer was made to contemplate the meaning of it. As time passed, these calligraphic works began to be prized as works of art, growing increasingly elaborate in the illumination and stylizing of the text. These illuminations were applied to other works besides the Quran, and it became a respected art form in and of itself.

===Indian aesthetics===
[[Indian art]] evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], &quot;Classical [[Indian architecture]], [[Indian sculpture|sculpture]], [[Indian painting|painting]], [[Indian literature|literature]] (''kāvya''), [[Music of India|music]], and [[Indian dance|dancing]] evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.&quot;

In the Pan Indian philosophic thought the term 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram' is another name for the concept of the Supreme. 'Sat' is the truth value, 'Shiv' is the good value &amp; 'Sundaram' is the beauty value. Man through his 'Srabana' or education, 'Manana' or experience and conceptualization and 'Sadhana' or practice, through different stages of life (Asramas) comes to form and realize the idea of these three values to develop a value system. This Value-system helps us to develop two basic ideas 1) that of 'Daksha' or the adept/expert and 2) of Mahana/Parama or  the Absolute and thus to judge anything in this universe in the light of these two measures, known as 'Adarsha'. A person who has mastered great amounts of knowledge of the grammars, rules, &amp; language of an art-form are adepts (Daksha), where as those who have worked through the whole system and journeyed ahead of these to become a law unto themself is called a Mahana. Individuals idea of 'Daksha' and 'Mahana' is relative to one's development of the concept of 'Satyam-Shivam-Sundaram.' For example, Tagore's idea of these two concepts should be way above any common man's and  many   perceive Tagore as a 'Mahana' Artist in the realm of literature.  This concept of Satyam-Shivam-Sundaram, a kind of Value Theory is the cornerstone of Indian Aesthetics.  

Of particular concern to Indian drama and literature are the term 'Bhava' or the state of mind  and ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' referring generally to the emotional flavors/essence crafted into the work by the writer and relished by a 'sensitive spectator' or ''sahṛdaya'' or one with positive taste and mind.  Poets like [[Kālidāsa]] were attentive to rasa, which blossomed into a fully developed aesthetic system.  Even in contemporary India the term ''rasa'' denoting &quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; is used colloquially to describe the aesthetic experiences in films; &quot;māsala mix&quot; describes popular Hindi cinema films which serve a so called balanced emotional meal for the masses, savored as rasa by these spectators.

Rasa theory blossoms beginning with the [[Sanskrit]] text [[Nātyashāstra]] (''nātya'' meaning &quot;drama&quot; and ''shāstra'' meaning &quot;science of&quot;), a work attributed to [[Bharata Muni]] where the Gods declare that drama is the 'Fifth Veda' because it is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction.  While the date of composition varies wildly among scholars, ranging from the era of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to the seventh century CE. The Nātyashāstra presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhāvas in Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the work as a whole.  Eight rasas and associated bhāvas are named and their enjoyment is likened to savoring a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that arise from the proper preparation of ingredients and the quality of ingredients.  What rasa actually is, in a theoretical sense, is not discussed and given the [[Nātyashāstra]]'s pithy wording it is unlikely the exact understanding of the original author(s) will be known.

The theory of the rasas develops significantly with the Kashmiri aesthetician Ãndandavardhana's classic on poetics, the Dhvanyāloka which introduces the ninth rasa, shānta-rasa as a specifically religious feeling of peace (''śānta'') which arises from its bhāva, weariness of the pleasures of the world.  The primary purpose of this text is to refine the literary concept ''dhvani'' or poetic suggestion, by arguing for the existence of ''rasa-dhvani'', primarily in forms of Sanskrit including a word, sentence or whole work &quot;suggests&quot; a real-world emotional state or bhāva, but thanks to [[aesthetic distance]], the sensitive spectator relishes the rasa, the aesthetic flavor of tragedy, heroism or romance.

The 9th - 10th century master of the religious system known as &quot;the nondual Shaivism of Kashmir&quot; (or &quot;Kashmir Shaivism&quot;) and aesthetician, [[Abhinavagupta]] brought rasa theory to its pinnacle in his separate commentaries on the Dhvanyāloka, the Dhvanyāloka-locana (translated by Ingalls, Masson and Patwardhan, 1992) and the Abhinavabharati, his commentary on the [[Nātyashāstra]], portions of which are translated by Gnoli and Masson and Patwardhan.  Abhinavagupta offers for the first time a technical definition of rasa which is the universal bliss of the Self or [[Atman]] colored by the emotional tone of a drama.  Shānta-rasa functions as an equal member of the set of rasas but is simultaneously distinct being the most clear form of aesthetic bliss.  Abhinavagupta likens it to the string of a jeweled necklace; while it may not be the most appealing for most people, it is the string that gives form to the necklace, allowing the jewels of the other eight rasas to be relished.  Relishing the rasas and particularly shānta-rasa is hinted as being as-good-as but never-equal-to the bliss of Self-realization experienced by yogis.

===Chinese aesthetics===
[[Chinese art]] has a long history of varied styles and emphases. In ancient times philosophers were already arguing about aesthetics. [[Confucius]] emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding &quot;li&quot; (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent [[Mozi]], however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich but not the common people.

By the 4th century AD, artists were debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. [[Gu Kaizhi]] has 3 surviving books on this theory of painting, for example, and it's not uncommon to find later artist/scholars who both create art and write about the creating of art. Religious and philosophical influence on art was common (and diverse) but never universal; it is easy to find art that largely ignores philosophy and religion in almost every Chinese time period.

===African aesthetics===

[[African art]] existed in many forms and styles, and with fairly little influence from outside [[Africa]]. Most of it followed traditional forms and the aesthetic norms were handed down orally as well as written. [[Sculpture]] and [[performance art]] are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest. The [[Nok culture]] is testimony to this. The [[mosque]] of [[Timbuktu]] shows that specific areas of Africa developed unique aesthetics.

===Western medieval aesthetics===
Surviving [[medieval art]] is primarily religious in focus and funded largely by the [[State (polity)|State]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. These art pieces often served a liturgical function, whether as [[Chalice (cup)|chalices]] or even as [[church (building)|church buildings]] themselves. Objects of fine art from this period were frequently made from rare and valuable materials, such as [[gold]] and [[lapis]], the cost of which commonly exceeded the wages of the artist.

Medieval aesthetics in the realm of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of [[Plotinus]] by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. [[Bonaventure]]’s “Retracing the Arts to Theology”, a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts; which light is guided by the light of sense perception which discloses the world of natural forms; which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth; finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.

Saint Thomas Aquinas's aesthetic is probably the most famous and influential theory among medieval authors, having been the subject of much scrutiny in the wake of the neo-Scholastic revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and even having received the approbation of the celebrated Modernist writer, James Joyce. Thomas, like many other medievals, never gives a systematic account of beauty itself, but several scholars have conventionally arranged his thought—though not always with uniform conclusions—using relevant observations spanning the entire corpus of his work. While Aquinas's theory follows generally the model of Aristotle, he develops a singular aesthetics which incorporates elements unique to his thought. Umberto Eco's ''The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas'' identifies the three main characteristics of beauty in Aquinas's philosophy: ''integritas sive perfectio'', ''consonantia sive debita proportio'', and ''claritas sive splendor formae''. While Aristotle likewise identifies the first two characteristics, St. Thomas conceives of the third as an appropriation from principles developed by neo-Platonic and Augustinian thinkers.

With the shift from the Middle Ages to the [[Renaissance]], art likewise changed its focus, as much in its content as in its mode of expression.

==Modern aesthetics==
From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called [[modernism]]. [[Germany|German]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] thinkers emphasised [[beauty]] as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at absolute beauty.

For [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For [[Immanuel Kant]] the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but similar human truth, since all people should agree that “this [[rose]] is beautiful” if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For [[Friedrich Schiller]] aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature.

For [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], the philosophy of art is the &quot;organon&quot; of philosophy concerning the relation between man and nature. So aesthetics began now to be the name for the ''philosophy of art''. [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] have also given lectures on aesthetics as ''philosophy of art'' after 1800.

For Hegel all culture is a matter of &quot;absolute spirit&quot; coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage, changing to a [[perfection]] that only philosophy can approach. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty.

For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty. It is thus for Schopenhauer one way to fight the [[suffering]].

The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. For [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] aesthetics consisted in the description of a whole culture which is a linguistic impossibility. That which constitutes aesthetics lies out side the realm of the language game.

On 7 January 1904 [[James Joyce]] attempted to publish A Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, only to have it rejected from the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.

For [[Oscar Wilde]] the contemplation of beauty for beauty's sake was not only the foundation for much of his literary career but was quoted as saying &quot;Aestheticism is a search after the signs of the beautiful. It is the science of the beautiful through which men seek the correlation of the arts. It is, to speak more exactly, the search after the secret of life.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; by [[Richard Ellman]] p 159, pub Alfred A Knopf, INC. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde famously toured the United States in 1882.  He travelled across the United States spreading the idea of Aesthetics in a speech called &quot;The English Renaissance.&quot; In his speech he proposed that Beauty and Aesthetics was &quot;not languid but energetic. By beautifying the outward aspects of life, one would beautify the inner ones.&quot;  The English Renaissance was, he said, &quot;like the Italian Renaissance before it, a sort of rebirth of the spirit of man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p164&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:William Hogarth 006.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[William Hogarth]], self-portrait, 1745]]
For [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[William Hogarth]], and [[Edmund Burke]] hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye on &quot;a wanton kind of chase&quot;; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of psychology (such as [[James Mill]]) or biology (such as [[Herbert Spencer]]).

==Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis==
Early twentieth century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that &quot;The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Edward, &quot;Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology,&quot; ''International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', 2005, p. 227.

Various attempts have been made to define Post-modern aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify &quot;beauty&quot; into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that “expression” is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a &quot;counter-environment&quot; designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as &quot;kalliphobia&quot; (after the Greek word for beauty - 'kalos').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p. 24-35&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.home.netspeed.com.au/derek.allan/default.htm André Malraux] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider [[beauty]] following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. ISBN 0-415-23804-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Berlyne]] created the field of experimental aesthetics in the 1970s, for which he is still the most cited individual decades after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Berlyne (1924-1976): Biographical Analysis. http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/furedy/daniel_berlyne.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pneumaist aestheticism]] is a theory of art and a highly experimental approach to art negating historical preconceptions of the aesthetic.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

==Aesthetics and information==
[[Image:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Initial image of a [[Mandelbrot set]] zoom sequence with continuously coloured environment]]
In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974).

Springer, 1974, ISBN 3211812164, ISBN 9783211812167&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithmic]] theory of [[beauty]] which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer’s previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. [[Low-complexity art]]. Leonardo, Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology, 30(2):97–103, 1997. http://www.jstor.org/pss/1576418&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Papers on the theory of beauty and [[low-complexity art]] since 1994: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of [[information]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Facial beauty and fractal geometry.  Cogprint Archive: http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk , 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived [[beauty]]. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[neural network]] - see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bits]] than before, the temporary [[interestingness]] of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward , also called  curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

==Applied aesthetics==
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects. Aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of clinical pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=7510314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coupling was made to reinforce the learning paradigm when English-language speakers used translators to address audiences in their own country. These audiences were generally not fluent in the English language. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], [[fashion]] and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709. [http://www.thielsch.org/download/paper/moshagen_2010.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic ethics==
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]] &lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882-1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being &quot;fair&quot; - the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page]] &lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) '' Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations. '' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. ISBN 978-1-59311-889-1. [http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php][http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/]&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==Truth as beauty, mathematics, analytic philosophy, and physics==
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics.  This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]].  Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations.  [[Beauty]] and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty&quot; in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]]. The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: &quot;Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?&quot;, ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: &quot;The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment&quot;, ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174-1178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational inference of aesthetics==
Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.  Large number of manually rated online photographs were used to &quot;teach&quot; computers about what visual properties are of relevance to aesthetic quality. The Acquine engine, developed at [[Penn State University]], rates natural photographs uploaded by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acquine.alipr.com |title=Aesthetic Quality Inference Engine - Instant Impersonal Assessment of Photos |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable in this area is Michael Leyton, professor of psychology at Rutgers University. Leyton is the president of the International Society for Mathematical and Computational Aesthetics and the
International Society for Group Theory in Cognitive Science and has developed a generative theory of shape.

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess and music.&lt;ref&gt;Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment==
Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. Aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon.
[[Immanuel Kant]], writing in 1790, observes of a man &quot;If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me'',&quot; because &quot;Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]&quot;. The case of &quot;beauty&quot; is different from mere &quot;agreeableness&quot; because, &quot;If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things.&quot;

Aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination. For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely &quot;the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition&quot;, but also our sensitivity &quot;to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.&quot; (Essays Moral Political and Literary. Indianapolis, Literary Classics 5, 1987.) Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]]. For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] &quot;enjoyment&quot; is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be &quot;beautiful&quot; has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once.

Viewer interpretations of beauty possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste.  Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty.  Taste is a result of [[education]] and awareness of elite cultural values{{clarify|date=November 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}; therefore taste can be learned{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  Taste varies according to [[Social class|class]], cultural background, and education{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  According to Kant, beauty is objective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  The contemporary view of beauty is not based on innate qualities, but rather on cultural specifics and individual interpretations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Factors involved in aesthetic judgment===
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rainbows often have aesthetic appeal.]]
Judgments of aesthetic value seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviors like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. Seeing a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] view of a landscape may give us a reaction of [[awe]], which might manifest physically as an increased heart rate or widened eyes. These unconscious reactions may even be partly constitutive of what makes our judgment a judgment that the landscape is sublime.

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorian]]s in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. The Abuse of Beauty, Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of [[Economy|economic]], [[politics|political]], or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in [[Architecture]] and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. ISBN 8254701741.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer, Carolyn ed. ''Aesthetics: The Big Questions'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Part and Parcel in Animal and Human Societies&quot;. in Studies in animal and human behavior, vol. 2. pp.&amp;nbsp;115–195. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1971 (originally pub. 1950.)
Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, &quot;Beauty and the Critic’s Judgment&quot;, in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behavior, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

===Are different art forms beautiful, disgusting, or boring in the same way?===
A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a fragrance, and a [[mathematical proof]] beautiful. What characteristics do they share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as beautiful? What makes a painting beautiful is quite different from what makes music beautiful, which suggests that each art form has its own language for the judgement of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg’s arguments in &quot;On Modernist Painting&quot; (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, there is seemingly quite a lack of words to express oneself accurately when making an aesthetic judgment. An aesthetic judgment cannot be an empirical judgement. Therefore, due to impossibility for precision, there is confusion about what interpretations can be culturally negotiated. Due to imprecision in the standard English language, two completely different feelings experienced by two different people can be represented by an identical verbal expression. Wittgenstein stated this in his lectures on aesthetics and language games.

A collective identification of beauty, with willing participants in a given social spectrum, may be a socially negotiated phenomenon, discussed in a culture or context. Is there some underlying unity to aesthetic judgment and is there some way to articulate the similarities of a beautiful house, beautiful proof, and beautiful sunset?&lt;ref name=&quot;kant&quot;&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], [[The Critique of Judgment]].&lt;/ref&gt; Defining it requires a description of the entire phenomenon, as Wittgenstein argued in his lectures on aesthetics. Likewise there has been long debate on how perception of beauty in the natural world, especially perception of the human form as beautiful, is supposed to relate to perceiving beauty in [[art]] or [[Cultural artefact|artefacts]]. This goes back at least to Kant, with some echoes even in St. Bonaventure. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{Cquote2|''Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.''|[[Barnett Newman]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art,'' By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, ISBN 0812695402, 9780812695403&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aesthetics is used by some as a synonym for the philosophy of [[art]] since [[Hegel]], while others insist on a distinction between these closely related fields. In practice aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[art work]].

The philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about the [[art work]]s, but has also to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for the [[philosophy]], because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any [[moral]] or [[political]] purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in the aesthetics : art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

How best to define the term “art” is a subject of constant contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art”.&lt;ref name= &quot;davies&quot;&gt;Davies, 1991, Carroll, 2000, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Danto2003&quot;&gt;Danto, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;Goodman,&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that vary considerably. Furthermore, it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term &quot;[[art]]&quot; has changed several times over the centuries, and has continued to evolve during the 20th century as well.

The main recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or “[[fine art]].” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the “finer” things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object, people will consider it a [[craft]] instead of art, a suggestion which is highly disputed by many [[Studio Craft|Contemporary Craft]] thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered [[design]] instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called [[applied art]]. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with the actual function of the object than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;Novitz, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Art usually implies no function other than to convey or communicate an idea.

Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that wasn't trying to be beautiful couldn't count as art. The [[cubism|cubists]], [[dada]]ists, [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], and many later art movements struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to [[Danto]], &quot;Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960’s but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Danto2003&quot;/&gt; Perhaps some notion like &quot;expression&quot; (in [[Benedetto Croce|Croce’s]] theories) or &quot;counter-environment&quot; (in [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan’s]] theory) can replace the previous role of beauty. [[Brian Massumi]] brought back &quot;beauty&quot; into consideration together with &quot;expression&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the 	Philosophy of Expression'', CRCL, 24:3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another view, as important to the philosophy of art as &quot;beauty,&quot; is that of the &quot;sublime,&quot; elaborated upon in the twentieth century by the [[postmodern]] philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. A further approach, elaborated by [http://home.netspeed.com.au/derek.allan/default.htm André Malraux] in works such as ''The Voices of Silence'', is that art is fundamentally a response to a metaphysical question ('Art', he writes, 'is an 'anti-destiny'). Malraux argues that, while art has sometimes been oriented towards beauty and the sublime (principally in post-Renaissance European art) these qualities, as the wider history of art demonstrates, are by no means essential to it.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan. ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux’s Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perhaps (as in [[William Kennick|Kennick's]] theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] fashion (as in [[Morris Weitz|Weitz]] or [[Joseph Beuys|Beuys]]). Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums and artists define as art is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This &quot;institutional definition of art&quot; (see also [[Institutional Critique]]) has been championed by [[George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider the depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] or a store-bought [[Urinal (restroom)|urinal]] to be art until [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the associations that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large.  If a poet writes down several lines, intending them as a poem, the very procedure by which it is written makes it a poem. Whereas if a journalist writes exactly the same set of words, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. [[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims that what decides whether or not something is art is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure).

===What should we judge when we judge art?===
[[File:Rainbow lorikeet.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nature provides aesthetic ideals.]]
Art can be difficult at the metaphysical and [[ontological]] levels as well as at the [[value theory]] level. When we see a performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'', how many works of art are we experiencing, and which should we judge? Perhaps there is only one relevant work of art, the whole performance, which many different people have contributed to, and which will exist briefly and then disappear. Perhaps the manuscript by Shakespeare is a distinct work of art from the play by the troupe, which is also distinct from the performance of the play by this troupe on this night, and all three can be judged, but are to be judged by different standards.

Perhaps every person involved should be judged separately on his or her own merits, and each costume or line is its own work of art (with perhaps the director having the job of unifying them all). Similar problems arise for music, film, dance, and even painting. Is one to judge the painting itself, the work of the painter, or perhaps the painting in its context of presentation by the museum workers?

These problems have been made even more difficult by the rise of [[conceptual art]] since the 1960s. Warhol’s famous ''Brillo Boxes'' are nearly indistinguishable from actual [[Brillo]] boxes at the time. It would be a mistake to praise Warhol for the design of his boxes (which were designed by Steve Harvey), yet the conceptual move of exhibiting these boxes as art in a museum together with other kinds of paintings is Warhol's. Are we judging Warhol’s concept? His execution of the concept in the medium? The [[curator]]’s insight in letting Warhol display the boxes? The overall result? Our experience or interpretation of the result? Ontologically, how are we to think of the work of art? Is it a physical object? Several objects? A class of objects? A mental object? A fictional object? An [[abstract object]]? An event? Or simply an Act?

===What should art be like?===
Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, “On Modernist Painting”.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dada]]ist [[Tristan Tzara]] on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. “We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits.”&lt;ref&gt;Tristan Tzara, Sept Manifestes Dada.&lt;/ref&gt; Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like.

===The value of art===
Tolstoy defined art, and not incidentally characterized its value, this way: &quot;Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them.&quot;

The value of art, then, is one with the value of empathy.

Other possible views are these: Art can act as a means to some special kind of knowledge. Art may give insight into the human condition. Art relates to [[science]] and [[religion]]. Art serves as a tool of education, or indoctrination, or enculturation. Art makes us more moral.  It uplifts us spiritually. Art is politics by other means. Art has the value of allowing [[catharsis]]. In any case, the value of art may determine the suitability of an art form. Do they differ significantly in their values, or (if not) in their ability to achieve the unitary value of art?

But to approach the question of the value of art systematically, one ought to ask: for whom? For the artist? For the audience? For society at large, and/or for individuals beyond the audience? Is the &quot;value&quot; of art different in each of these different contexts?

Working on the intended value of art tends to help define the relations between art and other acts. Art clearly does have spiritual goals in many contexts, but what exactly is the difference between religious art and religion ''per se''? The truth is complex; art is both useless in a functional sense, and also the most important human activity.

An argument for the value of art, used in the fictional work '[[The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]', proceeds that, should some external force presenting imminent destruction of Earth, ask the inhabitants, of what use is humanity, what should humanity's response be?  The argument continues that the only justification humanity could give for its continued existence would be the past creation and continued creation of things like a Shakespeare play, a Rembrandt painting or a Bach concerto. The suggestion is that these are the things of value which define humanity.&lt;ref&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Aesthetic universals==
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified seven universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutton&quot;&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

#Expertise or virtuosity.  Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
#Nonutilitarian pleasure.  People enjoy art for art's sake, and don't demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
#Style.  Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
#Criticism.  People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
#Imitation.  With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
#Special focus.  Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

It might be objected, however, that there are rather too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. &quot;Rules of composition&quot; that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4'33&quot;]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realisation). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalise traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as [[André Malraux]] and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea &quot;art&quot; itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, academics in both the sciences and the humanities look to [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] in an effort to understand the connection between psychology and aesthetics.  Aside from [[Dutton]], others exploring this realm include [[David Bordwell]], [[Brian Boyd]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Noel Carroll]], Ellen Dissanayake, Nancy Easterlin,  [[Bracha Ettinger]], David Evans, Jonathan Gottschall, [[Torben Grodal]], Paul Hernadi,, [[Patrick Hogan]], Carl Plantinga, [[Rolf Reber]], [[Elaine Scarry]], Murray Smith, Wendy Steiner, Robert Storey, [[Frederick Turner]], and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]].

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics has been criticized by some sociologists and writers about art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique aesthetic object but a continuum of cultural forms from ordinary speech to experiences that are signaled as art by a frame, institution or special event. [[Pierre Bourdieu]] also takes issue with Kant's aesthetics and argues that it represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure.

      <comment>/* The Babylonian Conquest and aftermath */ more accurate statement of biblical account</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Arca del pacto.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[3D computer graphics|virtual sculpture]] of the Ark of the Covenant by artist Alfonso Castillo Esteban González, based upon Biblical descriptions.]]

The '''Ark of the Covenant''' ({{lang-he|אָרוֹן הָבְּרִית}} ''Ārōn Hāb’rīt'', modern pron. ''Aron Habrit'') is a chest, described in [[Books of Kings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; as solely containing the [[Tablets of Stone]] on which the [[Ten Commandments]] were inscribed. According to the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|NIV|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some traditional interpretations of the [[Book of Exodus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:33-34|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Book of Numbers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|17:25-26|HE}} (or Numbers 17:10-11 in some translations)&lt;/ref&gt; the Ark also contained [[Aaron's rod]] and a jar of [[manna]].   However, 1 Kings 8:9 is categoric in declaring that the Ark contained only the two Tablets of the Law.

According to the [[Book of Exodus]], the Ark was built at the command of God, in accordance with the instructions given to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|25:10-16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; God was said to have communicated with Moses &quot;from between the two [[cherub]]im&quot; on the Ark's cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|25:22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rashi]] and some [[Midrash]]im suggest that there were two arks - a temporary one made by Moses himself, and a later one constructed by [[Bezalel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Hertz 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical account relates that during the Israelites' [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], the Ark was carried by the priests some 2,000 [[cubit]]s in advance of the people and their army, or host.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|4:5-6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ark was borne by priests into the bed of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]], water in the river separated, opening a pathway for the entire host to pass through (Josh. 3:15-16; 4:7-18). The city of [[Jericho]] was taken with no more than a shout after the Ark of The Covenant was paraded for seven days around its wall by seven priests sounding seven trumpets of [[shofar|rams' horns]] (Josh. 6:4-20). When carried, the Ark was always wrapped in a veil, in ''[[tachash]]'' skins and a blue cloth, and was carefully concealed, even from the eyes of the ''[[Cohanim]]'' who carried it.

There are no contemporary extra-biblical references to the Ark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cline|first=Eric H.|title=From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible|publisher=National Geographic|year=2007|isbn=978-1426200847|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
===Construction and description===

According to the [[Book of Exodus]], [[God of Israel|God]] instructed [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] during his 40 day stay upon the mountain within the thick cloud and darkness where God was (Ex. 19:20; 24:18) and he was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark to be made of [[Shittim Wood|shittim-wood]] to house the [[Tablets of Stone]].

The Book of Exodus gives detailed instructions on how the Ark is to be constructed. It is to be 2½ [[cubit]]s in length, 1½ in breadth, and 1½ in height (as {{convert/3 |2+1/2|x|1+1/2|x|1+1/2|royal cubit|m|disp=or}}). Then it is to be plated entirely with [[gold]], and a crown or molding of gold is to be put around it. Four rings of gold are to be attached—two on each side—and through these rings staves of shittim-wood overlaid with gold for carrying the Ark are to be inserted; and these are not to be removed. A golden cover, adorned with golden [[cherub]]im, is to be placed above the Ark. The Ark is finally to be placed behind a veil (''[[Parochet]]''), a full description of which is also given.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|25|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its creation by Moses, the Ark was carried by the [[Israelites]] during their 40-years of wandering in the desert. Whenever the Israelites camped, the Ark was placed in a special and sacred [[tent]], the [[Tabernacle]].

When the Israelites, led by [[Joshua]] toward the [[Promised Land]], arrived at the banks of the [[River Jordan]], the Ark was carried in the lead preceding the people and was the signal for their advance (Joshua 3:3, 6). During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priests—with the Ark—left the river after the people had passed over (Josh. 3:15-17; 4:10, 11, 18). As memorials, [[Twelve Stones|twelve stones]] were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood (Josh. 4:1-9).

In the [[Battle of Jericho]], the Ark was carried round the city once a day for seven days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven trumpets of rams' horns (Josh. 6:4-15). On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times and, with a great shout, Jericho's wall fell down flat and the people took the city (Josh. 6:16-20). After the defeat at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], Joshua lamented before the Ark (Josh. 7:6-9). When Joshua read the Law to the people between [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Mount Ebal]], they stood on each side of the Ark. The Ark was again set up by Joshua at [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]], but when the Israelites fought against Benjamin at [[Gibeah]], they had the Ark with them and consulted it after their defeat.

===Capture by the Philistines===
{{Main|Philistine captivity of the Ark}}
The Ark is next spoken of as being in the Tabernacle at [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] during Samuel's apprenticeship (1 Sam. 3:3). After the settlement of the Israelites in [[Canaan]], the Ark remained in the Tabernacle at [[Gilgal]] for a season before being removed to Shiloh until the time of [[Eli (Judges)|Eli]], between 300 and 400 years ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7:12), when it was carried into the field of battle, so as to secure, as they had hoped, victory to the Hebrews. The Ark was taken by the [[Philistines]] (1 Sam. 4:3-11) who subsequently sent it back after retaining it for seven months (1 Sam. 5:7, 8) because of the events said to have transpired.

After their first defeat at [[Eben-ezer]], the Israelites had the Ark brought from Shiloh, and welcomed its coming with great rejoicing. In the second battle, the Israelites were again defeated, and the Philistines captured the Ark (1 Sam. 4:3-5, 10, 11). The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger &quot;with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.&quot; The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him [[Ichabod]]—explained as &quot;Where is glory?&quot; in reference to the loss of the Ark (1 Sam. 4:12-22).

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them (1 Sam. 5:1-6). At [[Ashdod]] it was placed in the temple of [[Dagon]]. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with [[tumors]]; a plague of rats was sent over the land (1 Sam. 6:5). The affliction of boils was also visited upon the people of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and of [[Ekron]], whither the Ark was successively removed (1 Sam. 5:8-12).

After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and rats wherewith they had been afflicted. The Ark was set in the field of Joshua the [[Beth-shemesh|Beth-shemite]], and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings (1 Sam. 6:1-15). Out of curiosity the men of [[Beth-shemesh]] gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment, seventy of them (fifty thousand seventy in some ms.) were smitten by the Lord (1 Sam. 6:19). The Bethshemites sent to [[Kirjath-jearim]], or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed (1 Sam. 6:21); and it was taken to the house of [[Abinadab]], whose son [[Eleazar]] was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consult the Ark in the days of [[Saul]].

===In the days of King David===
[[File:Morgan-bible-fl-39.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of David bringing the Ark into Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6).]]
At the beginning of his reign, King [[David]] removed the Ark from [[Kirjath-jearim]] amid great rejoicing. On the way to [[Zion]], [[Uzzah]], one of the drivers of the cart whereon the Ark was carried, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was smitten by God for touching it. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of [[Obed-edom]] the [[Gath (city)|Gittite]], instead of carrying it on to Zion, and there it stayed three months (2 Samuel 6:1-11; 1 Chronicles 13:1-13).

On hearing that God had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the [[Levite]]s, while he himself, &quot;girded with a linen [[ephod]],&quot; &quot;danced before the Lord with all his might&quot; and in the sight of all the public gathered in Jerusalem — a performance that caused him to be scornfully rebuked by his first wife, Saul's daughter [[Michal]] (2 Sam. 6:12-16, 20-22; 1 Chron. 15). In Zion, David put the Ark in the tabernacle he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household (2 Sam. 6:17-20; 1 Chron. 16:1-3; 2 Chron. 1:4).

The Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark (1 Chron. 16:4). David's plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped at the advice of God (2 Sam. 7:1-17; 1 Chron. 17:1-15; 28:2, 3). The Ark was with the army during the siege of [[Rabbah]] (2 Sam. 11:11); and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of [[Absalom]]'s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] the priest to return it to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:24-29).

===In Solomon's Temple===
[[File:Folio 29r - The Ark of God Carried into the Temple.jpg|thumb|The Ark carried into the Temple]]
When [[Abiathar]] was dismissed from the priesthood by King [[Solomon]] for having taken part in [[Adonijah]]'s [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark (1 Kings 2:26). Solomon worshipped before the Ark after his dream in which God promised him wisdom (1 Kings 3:15).

During the construction of [[Solomon's Temple]], a special inner room, named ''[[Kodesh Hakodashim]]'' (Eng. [[Holy of Holies]]), was prepared to receive and house the Ark (1 Kings 6:19); and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark—containing the original [[Tablets of Stone|tablets]] of the [[Ten Commandments]]—was placed therein (1 Kings 8:6-9). When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, &quot;for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord&quot; (1 Kings 8:10-11; 2 Chron. 5:13, 14).

When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside [[Zion]], as Zion was consecrated because of its containing the Ark (2 Chron. 8:11). King Josiah had the Ark put in the Temple (2 Chron. 35:3), whence it appears to have again been removed by one of his successors.

===The Babylonian Conquest and aftermath===
In 586 BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|destroyed Jerusalem]] and Solomon's Temple. There is no record of what became of the ark.

===Book of Revelation===
According to the [[Book of Revelation]], the Ark is in the Temple of God in Heaven in vision: &quot;Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the Ark of his Covenant&quot; (Rev. 11:19 NIV).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofthebible.com/Bible%20Studies/Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant%20in%20Prophecy.pdf The Ark of the Covenant in Prophecy] By Dr. Randall Price&lt;/ref&gt;

==References to the Ark in Scripture==
===Tanakh===

The Ark is first mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]], and then numerous times in [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[I Samuel]], [[II Samuel]], [[I Kings]], [[I Chronicles]], [[II Chronicles]], [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]. In the Book of Jeremiah, it is referenced by [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who, speaking in the days of [[Josiah]] (Jer. 3:16), prophesied a future time when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again.

===Second Book of Maccabees===
{{See also|Books of the Maccabees}}
In the [[Septuagint|Septuagint/Old Testament]] book [[Second Maccabees]], Chapter 2, &quot;one finds in the records&quot; that Jeremiah, having received an oracle of the Lord, ordered that the tent and the ark and the altar of incense should follow him to the [[Biblical Mount Sinai|mountain of God]] where he sealed them up in a cave, and he told those who followed him in order to mark the way, but they could not find it, &quot;The place shall remain unknown until God gathers his people together again and shows his mercy, and then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord and the cloud shall appear, as they were shown in the case of Moses, and as Solomon asked that the place be specially consecrated.&quot; [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%202Maccabees&amp;verse=2:4-8 2 Maccabees 2:4-8]

===New Testament===
[[File:Cathédrale d'Auch 20.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Carrying the Ark of the Covenant: gilded bas-relief at the [[Auch Cathedral]]]]

In the [[New Testament]], the Ark is mentioned in the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation to St. John]]. {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|NIV}} states that the Ark contained &quot;the golden pot that had [[manna]], and [[Aaron's rod]] that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.&quot; {{bibleverse||Revelation|11:19|NIV}} says the prophet saw God's temple in heaven opened, &quot;and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.&quot;

A number of [[Roman Catholic]] writers connect this verse with the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:1|NIV}}, which immediately follows, and argue that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] is the &quot;Ark of the New Covenant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ray|first=Steve|title=Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant|journal=[[This Rock]]|year=2005|month=October|volume=16|issue=8|url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/0510fea5.asp|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quran===
In chapter 2 (Verse 248), the Children of Israel, at the time of [[Samuel]] and [[Saul]], were given back the ''Tabut E Sakina'' (the casket of [[Shekhinah]]) which contained remnants of the household of [[Musa]] (Moses) and [[Islamic view of Aaron|Harun]] (Aaron) carried by angels which confirmed peace and reassurance for them from their Lord. The [[Qur'an]] states:
{{quote|And (further) their Prophet said to them: &quot;A Sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security (''[[Sakina]]'') from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if ye indeed have faith.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|248|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic scholar [[Baidawi|Al Baidawi]] mentioned that the ''sakina'' could be [[Tawrat]], the Books of Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JherW50tVyAC&amp;pg=PA624&amp;dq=ark+of+the+covenant+islam |title=A Dictionary of Islam By Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes, pg 624|publisher=Books.google.com|date=1995-12-01|accessdate=2010-03-07|isbn= 9788120606722|author1=Hughes, Thomas Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Al-Jalalan, the relics in the Ark were the fragments of the two tablets, rods, robes, shoes, mitres of Moses and the vase of manna.&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot; /&gt; Al-Tha'alibi, in ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (The Stories of the Prophets), has given an earlier and later history of the Ark.

According to most Muslim scholars, the Ark of the Covenant has a religious basis in Islam, and Islam gives it special significance. Shia sect of Muslims believe that it will be found by [[Mahdi]] near the [[Qiyamah|end of times]] from Lake Tiberias.&lt;ref&gt;Iqd al-Durar fi Akbar al-Imam al-Muntadhar, by Shaikh Jamaluddin Yusuf al Damishqi, p. 51-a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rumoured current locations==
Since its disappearance, the Ark entered the domain of legend, and some have claimed to have discovered or have possession of the Ark. Several possible places have been suggested for its location.

===Mount Nebo===
[[2 Maccabees]] 2:4-10, written around 100 BC, says that the prophet [[Jeremiah]], &quot;being warned by God&quot; before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Babylonian invasion]], took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)]], informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown &quot;until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy.&quot;

===Ethiopia===
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in [[Axum]] allegedly houses the original Ark of the Covenant.]]

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant, or ''[[Tabot]]'', in [[Axum, Ethiopia|Axum]]. The object is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] and is used occasionally in ritual processions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raffaele, [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/ark-covenant-200712.html?c=y&amp;page=1 &quot;Keepers of the Lost Ark?&quot; ''Smithsonian Magazine''], December 2007 (accessed 5 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Replicas of the Axum ''tabot'' are kept in every Ethiopian church, each with its own dedication to a particular saint, the most popular of these include Mary, George and Michael.&lt;ref name=munro-hay&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, 2005, ''The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant'', Tauris (reviewed in ''Times Literary Supplement'' 19 August 2005 p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'', composed to legitimise the new dynasty ruling [[Ethiopia]] following its establishment in 1270, narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by [[Menelik I]] with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the ''Kebra Nagast'' is the best-known account of this belief, the belief predates the document. [[Abu al-Makarim|Abu Salih the Armenian]], writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. &quot;The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant&quot;, he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, &quot;on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B.T.A. Evetts (translator), ''The Churches and Monasteries of Egypt and Some Neighboring Countries attributed to Abu Salih, the Armenian'', with added notes by Alfred J. Butler (Oxford, 1895), pp. 287f&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, [[Abune Paulos]], said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Fendel, Hillel (2009-06-25).

Retrieved on 2009-06-25&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, on 26 June 2009, the patriarch announced that he would not unveil the Ark after all, but that instead he could attest to its current status.&lt;ref&gt;IGN (2009-06-19).

===Southern Africa===
The [[Lemba people]] of South Africa and Zimbabwe have claimed that their ancestors carried the Ark south, calling it the ''[[ngoma lungundu]]'' or &quot;voice of God&quot;, eventually hiding it in a deep cave in the Dumghe mountains, their spiritual home.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' by Tudor Parfitt, published by HarperCollins 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1715337,00.html ''A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant''], By David Van Biema Thursday, Time.com, Feb. 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2008, in a UK [[Channel 4]] documentary broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|title=Debates &amp; Controversies - Quest for the Lost Ark|publisher=Channel4.com|date= 2008-04-14|accessdate=2010-03-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080513034056/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tudor Parfitt]], taking a literalist approach to the Biblical story, described his research into this claim. He says that the object described by the Lemba has attributes similar to the Ark. It was of similar size, was carried on poles by priests, was not allowed to touch the ground, was revered as a voice of their God, and was used as a weapon of great power, sweeping enemies aside.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In his book ''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' (2008), Parfitt also suggests that the Ark was taken to Arabia following the [[Second Book of Maccabees]], and cites Arabic sources which maintain it was brought in distant times to [[Yemen]]. One Lemba clan, the Buba, which was supposed to have brought the Ark to Africa, have a genetic signature called the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]]. This suggests a male Semitic link to the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, Sol &quot;The genetics of Jewish ancestry&quot; which is a review of ''Abraham's Children: Race, Identity and the DNA of the Chosen People'' by Jon Entine ''The Washington Times'' [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/oct/28/the-genetics-of-jewish-ancestry/]&lt;/ref&gt; Lemba tradition maintains that the Ark spent some time in [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] in Yemen. Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of the [[Great Zimbabwe civilization]]. According to their oral traditions, some time after the arrival of the Lemba with the Ark, it self-destructed. Using a core from the original, the Lemba priests constructed a new one. This replica was discovered in a cave by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Germany|German]] missionary named [[Harald von Sicard]] in the 1940s and eventually found its way to the Museum of Human Science in [[Harare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;

Parfitt had this artifact radio-[[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to about 1350 AD, which coincided with the sudden end of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe|Great Zimbabwe civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem4308 ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips claims it remained there until the 1180s, when [[Ralph de Sudeley]], the leader of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] found the Maccabean treasure at [[Jebel al-Madhbah]], returned home to his estate at [[Herdewyke]] in [[Warwickshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], taking the treasure with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Phillips|first=Graham|authorlink=Graham Phillips (author)|title=The Templars and the Ark of the Covenant: The Discovery of the Treasure of Solomon|publisher=[[Bear &amp; Company]]|month=April|year=2005|url=http://www.grahamphillips.net/Ark/Ark_Intro.htm|isbn= 1591430399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Roman empire]] under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117-138), showing the location of the '''Anglii''' then inhabiting the neck of the [[Jutland]] peninsula (Denmark)]]
The '''Angles''' is a modern [[English language|English]] word for a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]] who took their name from the ancestral cultural region of [[Angeln]], a district located in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]. The Angles were one of the main groups that settled in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the [[Fall of the Roman Empire|post-Roman]] period, founding several of the kingdoms of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], and their name is the root of the name &quot;[[England]]&quot;.

==Etymology==
The ethnic name &quot;'''Angle'''&quot; has had various forms and spellings, the earliest attested being the Latinized name '''Anglii''', a Germanic tribe mentioned in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]]. 

The original noun from which this adjective was produced has not been determined with confidence. The stem is theorized to have had the form *Ang?l/r-. The more prominent etymological theories concerning the name's origin have included:
* Derivation from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', translating as &quot;angle&quot;.
* The [[Old English]] word for the [[Jutland]]ic district of [[Angeln]] (where the Angles are believed to have emigrated from) is ''Angel''. This is the preferred etymological theory amongst historians, and may connect to ''Angle'' (the peninsula is noted for its &quot;angular&quot; shape).
* It may mean &quot;the people who dwell by the Narrow Water,&quot; (i.e. the [[Schlei]]), from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''ang-'' meaning &quot;narrow&quot;.
* Derivation from the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] god [[Ingwaz]] or the [[Ingvaeones]] federation of which the Angles were part (the initial vowel could as well be &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot;).

[[Pope]] [[Gregory the Great]] is the first known to have simplified '''Anglii''' to '''Angli''', which he did in an epistle, the latter form developing into the preferred form of the word in Britain and throughout the continent (the generic form becoming '''Anglus''' in answer). The country remained '''Anglia''' in Latin. Meanwhile, there are several likenesses of form and meaning attested in Old English literature: [[King Alfred]]'s ([[Alfred the Great]]) translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' history of the world uses '''Angelcynn''' (-kin) to describe England and the English people; [[Bede]] used '''Angelfolc''' (-folk); there are also such forms as '''Engel''', '''Englan''' (the people), '''Englaland''', and '''Englisc''', all showing signs of vocalic mutation and later developing into the dominant forms.

'''Angle''' is used as the root of the [[French language|French]] and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] words '''Angleterre''' (Angleland, i.e. England) and '''anglais''' (English).

==Early history==
===Angles under other names===
Two important geographers, [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], are silent concerning the Angles. Their reasons for this exclusion was their consideration of the south shore of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to be ''terra incognita'', &quot;unknown land.&quot; However, both Strabo and Pliny describe that shore. Since the Angles took a geographic name, they likely had other names not based on geography.

Strabo's mention of the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] places his knowledge in the final years of [[Augustus]]' reign and after, which is the early first century.
Strabo (7.2.1, 4 and 7.3.1) states that the [[Cimbri]] still live on the peninsula ([[Jutland]]) where they always did, even though some of them liked to wander. Beyond the [[Elbe]] the coastal people are unknown in Strabo's work, but south of them are the [[Suebi]] from the Elbe to the Getae ([[Goths]]). Strabo worked eastward from the [[Rhine]].

Pliny, on the other hand, worked from east to west (4.13.94). His description leaves the [[Black Sea]], crosses the Ripaei mountains to the shore of the northern ocean, and follows it westward to [[Cadiz]]. In the first direction is [[Scythia]], where the [[Sarmatians|Sarmati]], [[Venedi]], [[Sciri]], and [[Hirri]] are located, as far as the [[Vistula]].
Then the [[Inguaeones]] begin. Baunonia ([[Bornholm]]) is an island opposite Scythia. Cylipenus, probably the Bay of [[Kiel]], is described, and from there a gulf called Lagnus, which is on the frontier of the Cimbri. Its location is not known, but it was likely in the Angeln region.

In Pliny, the Inguaeones consisted of the Cimbri and the [[Teutones]] (the [[Chauci]] as well, but they were not in this region). If Lagnus was situated on the Cimbrian frontier and after Kiel, then Angeln must have been in the territory of the Teutones. They were perhaps not named &quot;Angles&quot; at that time; however, the territory of the Teutones probably included the [[Vorpommern]] and the region south to the Elbe (mainly Holstein), accounting for the implied larger range of the Angles in later sources.

===Tacitus===
[[Image:Angeln.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The map shows both the Angeln peninsula (to the east of Flensburg and Schleswig) and the Schwansen peninsula (south of the Schlei).]]
Possibly the first instance of the Angles in recorded history is in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', chapter [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]], in which the &quot;Anglii&quot; are mentioned in passing in a list of Germanic tribes. He gives no precise indication of their geographical situation but states that, together with six other tribes, they worshiped a goddess named [[Nerthus]], whose sanctuary was located on &quot;an island in the Ocean&quot;. The other tribes are the [[Reudigni]], [[Aviones]], [[Varini]], [[Eudoses]], [[Suarini]] and [[Nuitones]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]], Medieval Source Book. Code and format by Northvegr.[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/tacitus/009.php]&lt;/ref&gt; which together are described as being behind ramparts of rivers and woods,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus (1877), ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]]; translation from ''The Agricola and Germania'', A. J. Church and W. J. Brodribb, trans., London: Macmillan, pp. 87-110(?), as recorded in the ''Medieval Sourcebook'' [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/tacitus1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., inaccessible to attack. As the Eudoses are the [[Jutes]], these names probably refer to localities in Jutland or on the Baltic coast, in which case their inhabitants would be Cimbri or Teutones for Pliny. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who considered it unknown, inaccessible, with a small population and of little economic interest. 

The majority of scholars believe that the Anglii lived on the coasts of the [[Baltic Sea]], probably in the southern part of the [[Jutland|Jutish peninsula]]. This view is based partly on Old English and Danish traditions regarding persons and events of the 4th century, and partly on the fact that striking affinities to the cult of [[Nerthus]] as described by Tacitus are to be found in pre-Christian Scandinavian, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.

The account in ''Germania'' is inconsistent with Strabo's and Pliny's on a major point. Tacitus called the Baltic the Suebian Sea and viewed the seven tribes that included the Anglii as Suebi. For Pliny the Suebi were among the tribes of [[Herminones]] in central Germany. For Strabo, the Suebi were to the south of the coast. The Suebian language developed into [[Old High German]], while the Angles and Jutes were among the speakers of [[Old Saxon]].

===Suevi Angili===
[[Ptolemy]] in his ''Geography'' (2.10), half a century later, presents a somewhat more complex view. The [[Saxons]] are placed around the lower [[Elbe]], which area they could have reached merely by an extension of the Saxon alliance. East of them are the [[Teutones]] and also a dissimilation of them, the Teutonoari, which denotes &quot;men&quot; (wer); i.e., &quot;the Teuton men.&quot; These Teutons or Teuton men appear to have been in Angeln and the land around it.

The Angles, as such, are not listed at all. Instead there are '''Syeboi Angeilloi''', Latinized to '''Suevi Angili''', located south of the middle Elbe. Owing to the uncertainty of this passage, there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the Anglii. One theory is that they or part of them dwelt or moved along other coastal people perhaps confederated up to the basin of the [[Saale]] (in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of [[Unstruttal (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Engilin]]) on the [[Unstrut]] valleys below the [[Kyffhäuserkreis]], from which region the ''Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum'' is believed by many to have come.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Germanic_law#Lex_Angliorum_et_Werinorum.2C_hoc_est.2C_Thuringorum&lt;/ref&gt;
The ethnic names of [[Frisians]] and [[Warini|Warines]] are attested in the neighborhood names of this [[Saxon]] or [[Swabian]] lands.

A second possible solution is that these Angles of Ptolemy are not those of Schleswig at all. According to [[Julius Pokorny]] the Angri- in [[Angrivarii]], the -angr in [[Hardanger]] and the Angl- in Anglii all come from the same root meaning &quot;bend&quot;, but in different senses. In other words, the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond Germanic. The Suevi Angeli would have been in [[Lower Saxony]] or near it and, like Ptolemy's Suevi [[Semnones]], were among the Suebi at the time.

===Bede===
[[Image:Beda Petersburgiensis f3v.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript of Bede.]]
[[Bede]] confidently states that the Anglii, before coming to Great Britain, dwelt in a land called Angulus, &quot;which lies between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons, and remains unpopulated to this day.&quot; Similar evidence is given by the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. King [[Alfred the Great]] and the chronicler [[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]] identified this place with the district that is now called [[Angeln]], in the province of [[Schleswig]] (Slesvig) (though it may then have been of greater extent), and this identification agrees with the indications given by Bede. In the Norwegian seafarer [[Ohthere]]'s account of a two-day's voyage from the Oslo fjord to Schleswig, he reported the lands on his starboard bow, and Alfred appended the note &quot;on these islands dwelt the ''Engle'' before they came hither&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''King Alfred's Orosius'', ed. H. Sweet (Early English Text Society) 1883:19, noted in H.R. Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:24.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named [[Wermund]] and [[Offa of Angel]], from whom the [[Mercian]] royal family claimed descent and whose exploits are connected with Angeln, Schleswig, and [[Rendsburg]]. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, [[Frowinus]] ([[Freawine]]) and [[Ket and Wig|Wigo]] (Wig), from whom the royal family of [[Wessex]] claimed descent. During the 5th century, the Anglii invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of ''Suevi Angili''.

The province of Schleswig has proved rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. A broad cremation cemetery has been found at [[Borgstedterfeld]], between Rendsburg and [[Eckernförde]], and it has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in pagan graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at [[Thorsberg moor]] (in Angeln) and [[Nydam Mose|Nydam]], which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, etc., and in Nydam even ships. By the help of these discoveries, Angle civilization in the age preceding the invasion of Great Britain can be fitted together.

==Angle kingdoms in England==
{{see also|History of Anglo-Saxon England}}
[[Image:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|right|Angles and Saxons throughout England]]
According to sources such as the History of Bede, after the invasion of [[Great Britain]], the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of the ''Nord Angelnen'' ([[Northumbria]]), ''Ost Angelnen'' ([[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]]), and the ''Mittlere Angelnen'' ([[Mercia]]). H.R. Loyn has observed in this context that &quot;a sea voyage is perilous to tribal institutions,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the apparently tribally-based kingdoms were produced in England. In early times there were two northern kingdoms (Bernicia and Deira) and two midland ones (Middle Anglia and Mercia). As a result of influence from the West Saxons, the tribes were collectively called [[Anglo-Saxons]] by the [[Normans]], the West Saxon kingdom having conquered, united and founded the [[Kingdom of England]] by the 10th century. The regions of East Anglia and Northumbria are still known by their original titles to this day. Northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast [[Scotland]], including [[Edinburgh]], and as far south as the [[Humber Estuary]].

The rest of that people stayed at the centre of the Angle homeland in the northeastern portion of the modern German ''Bundesland'' of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], on the [[Jutland Peninsula]]. There, a small peninsular area is still called &quot;[[Angeln]]&quot; today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern [[Flensburg]] on the Flensburger Fjord to the [[City of Schleswig]] and then to Maasholm, on the [[Schlei]] inlet.

==St. Gregory==
The Angles are the subject of a legend about [[Pope Gregory I]] which apparently has roots in history. Gregory happened to see a group of Angle children from [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] for sale as slaves in the Roman market. Gregory inquired about their background. When told they were called &quot;''Anglii''&quot; (Angles), he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: “''Bene, nam et angelicam habent faciem, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes''” (&quot;It is well, for they have an angelic face, and such people ought to be co-heirs of the [[angel]]s in heaven&quot;). Supposedly, he thereafter resolved to convert their pagan homeland to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede2.shtml ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', book 2] by Bede&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aster CT-80 oldest model 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The very first &quot;kit&quot; version of the Aster CT-80 running Newdos/80. Note that the 64x16 TRS-80 mode screen uses only a small part of the monitor screen, because the letters are the same size as the 80×25 CP/M screen, this was one of the things that was soon after fixed with the redesign to a commercial product]]
The '''Aster CT-80''', an early [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]] developed by the small [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company MCP (later renamed to '''Aster Computers'''), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists. Later it was sold ready to use. It consisted of several [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] [[Printed circuit board|PCB's]] with [[DIN 41612]] connectors, and a [[backplane]] all based on a [[19-inch rack]] configuration. It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.&lt;ref&gt;Except perhaps for the [[Holborn System 9100]] computer which was a few months earlier, but which was designed and sold as a minicomputer at ten times the price of the Aster.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy [[TRS-80]] computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run [[CP/M]] software, with a big amount of free memory and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal.

==Models==
Three models were sold. The first model looked like the later [[IBM PC]] (which came on the market years later), a rectangular base unit with two [[floppy]] drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5¼&quot; floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened [[Apple II|Apple]] with a built-in keyboard.

All units ran much faster than the original [[TRS-80]], at 4 [[Megahertz|MHz]], (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set. The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 [[Kilobyte|KB]], more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80. A special version of [[NewDos/80]], (an improved [[TRS-DOS]] compatible [[Disk operating system]]) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.

For the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed. This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils. The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer. There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.

==Working modes==
The Aster used 64KB of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully [[TRS-80]] compatible, with 48KB or RAM. When the boot loader detected a [[CP/M]] floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs (TPA) and an 80 x 25 display. This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the [[LOBO Max-80]].

With a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.

A third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a [[Videotex]] terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.

==Sales==

Most Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the &quot;honderd scholen project&quot; (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools. MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands. Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that). Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to [[Philips]] and their [[Philips P2000|P2000]] homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in [[Austria]] and did not have network hard nor software.

==The company==

Aster computers was based in the small town of [[Arkel]] near the town of [[Gorinchem]].
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time . They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the &quot;[[Elektor Junior Computer|junior Computer]]&quot; from [[Elektor]] (a copy of the [[KIM-1]]), and the [[ZX80]] from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the [[Western Digital#Key innovations|WD1771]] floppy disc controller chip without an external &quot;data separator&quot;. To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to ''MCP CHIP'' but ran into problems with the German computer magazine [[CHIP (magazine)|CHIP]], and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the [[TRS-80]], the [[Video Genie]], (another TRS-80 clone), the [[Luxor AB|Luxor]] [[ABC 80]] and the [[Apple II]].
They also sold the exotic [[Olivetti]] M20, a very early 16 bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a [[Z8000]] CPU.

After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface. They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80. So they decided to designed a TRS-80 and CP/M software compatible computer system, which (following the lead of [[Apple Computer]]) they decided to name after a &quot;typical Dutch flower&quot;. So they called it the Aster CT-80 ('''C'''P/M/'''T'''andy'''-'''19'''80'''). Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that &quot;Aster&quot; is also a Dutch girls name has something to do with it. Remarkably &quot;Aster&quot; was also the name given to a Dutch [[Supercomputer]] much later, in 2002.

The first version of the Aster consisted of four &quot;[[Eurocard (PCB)|Eurocard]]'s&quot;, one [[Z80]] CPU card with 64KB memory, one [[Motorola]] [[MC6845]] based video card, one [[double density]] floppy disk controller card and one &quot;keyboard/[[RS232]]/cassette interface&quot; card. Plus a &quot;backplane card&quot;, (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard. And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard. After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system. However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system. Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64x16 portion of the 80x25 screen)  with an improved font set (adding &quot;gray scale&quot; version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special [[PETSCII]] like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a [[19-inch rack]] for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply. A software engineer was hired to write the special &quot;dual boot mode&quot; BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS. The &quot;dual boot mode&quot; BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much &quot;workspace&quot; as possible, and the 80x25 video mode. It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS232 port with modified cabling. The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the &quot;kit&quot; versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.

Soon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.

After the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the [[TRS-80#Model III|TRS-80 Model 3]] computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did. In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.

The aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Asters high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers. The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems. The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units. Through a special &quot;video-switch&quot; the teacher was also able to see a copy of each students display on his own screen. About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.

Unfortunately, because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.

Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another [[Netherlands|Dutch]] computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower &amp;mdash; the [[Nedfield|Tulip's]] [[Tulip System-1]] which appeared about the same time Aster folded.

Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) [[MSX]] system for a company called &quot;Micro Technology b.v.&quot;.

==Unreleased add ons==

To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).
* A very High resolution monochrome video card with [[blitter]] and hardware line drawing capability, was designed for [[CAD]] applications, based on a [[NEC]] chip designed for graphic terminals for supercomputers.
* A colour video card with [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability based on the same video chip (the [[Texas Instruments TMS9918|TMS9918]]) as the [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI99/4]] and [[MSX]] computers, designed for gaming, and more creative and colorful educational software. A working prototype of this card was finished.
* A replacement card for the original TRS-80 compatible video card, software compatible to the original one, but with added color and very high resolution capabilities. was also on the drawing board. Based on a newer, slightly more flexible, version of the Asters original [[Motorola]] MC6845 video chip, the [[Conexant|Rockwell]] 6545, it worked by adding a new video mode, one with the ability to reprogram an extended, (2048 characters instead of 256 characters) version of the [[character set]], supported by an extended character memory of the video card that did not use one (8 bit) byte per character, but an 11 bit &quot;word&quot;, so it could address each one of the available 2048 unique programmable characters. This meant it could provide a separate programmable character for all of the 1024 (64x16) or 2000 (80x25) characters on the screen. By filling the character pointer memory with values from zero to 1919 this essentially turned the text mode display into a very high resolution graphics mode, with the &quot;font memory&quot;, acting as the high resolution [[Raster graphics]] video memory. Because the characters were 8 x 12 pixels this meant that video resolutions of 512 x 192 pixels (in 64x16 character mode), or 640 x 300 pixels (in 80x24 character mode) were created, which was quite high for the time. The &quot;double width&quot; mode of the TRS-80 was also supported, so 256 x 192 pixels (in 32x16 character mode), or 320 x 300 pixels (in 40x24 character mode)  were also possible. The video card also supported 16 foreground and 16 background colors per character, by providing one byte per character position (2K) of &quot;color ram&quot;. One nibble of such a byte then controlled the foreground color, and the other nibble controlled the background color, a system very similar to the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], in fact in the 256x192 mode the display mode was virtually identical to the video of the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. The color memory was also available in the &quot;normal&quot; TRS-80 and CP/M text modes, which meant that existing TRS-80 and CP/M software could be easily modified to add color. This video card would also support fast scrolling of high resolution color screens for games, because it had the indirection of the character pointers, so it was possible to quickly scroll the high resolution display, (or use other effects) by simply manipulating the 1920/1024 byte text video instead of the 24.576 bytes of high resolution video memory.

A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a [[SCSI]] interface, and the necessary software. A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.

Finally a replacement for the aging [[Z80]] processor was being developed in the form of an [[Intel 8086]] board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards. Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion.

Unfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.

This is a list of animated television series first aired before 2000 (to see animated television series from 2000, see &quot;[[List of animated television series from 2000s]]&quot;) [[Cartoon series|Animated television series]] are [[television program]]s produced by means of [[animation]]. This list does not feature animated theatrical short series as those were produced for theaters. This list includes compilation series of theatrical shorts such as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'' since they often feature new wrap-around animation.

The '''Atlanta Braves''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball club]] based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The Braves are a member of the [[National League East|Eastern Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]]. From [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1997]] to the present, the Braves have played in [[Turner Field]].

The &quot;Braves&quot; name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] warrior. They are [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknamed]] &quot;the '''''Bravos'''''&quot;, and often self-styled as &quot;[[America's Team]]&quot; in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available [[Braves TBS Baseball|TBS]] until the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]], gaining a wide fanbase.

From 1991–2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20060920&amp;content_id=1673160&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Yanks celebrate ninth straight East title |accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060913&amp;content_id=1659755&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl &quot;Braves have set lofty benchmark&quot;], MLB.com, September 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (omitting the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 season]] in which there were no official division champions). The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010. The Braves advanced to the [[World Series]] five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 9 [[National League Championship Series|National League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennants]], as well as three World Series championships—in [[1914 World Series|1914]] as the Boston Braves, in [[1957 World Series|1957]] as the Milwaukee Braves, and in [[1995 World Series|1995]] in Atlanta. The Braves are the only [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities. The [[National Football League|National Football League's]] [[St. Louis Rams]] are the only other major sports franchise to do this.

The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the [[Chicago Cubs]]) and was founded in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1871 as the '''Boston Red Stockings''' (not to be confused with the American League's [[Boston Red Sox]]). After various name changes (such as the '''Boston Beaneaters'''), the team operated as the '''Boston Braves''' for most of the first half of the 20th century. In [[1953 Major League Baseball season|1953]], the team moved to [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and became the '''Milwaukee Braves''', followed by the move to Atlanta in [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966]]. The team's tenure in Atlanta is famous for [[Hank Aaron]] breaking [[Babe Ruth]]'s career home run record in 1974, though the majority of Aaron's home runs were hit while the team was in Milwaukee. His record stood until [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007]], when San Francisco left fielder [[Barry Bonds]] broke the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292498,00.html |work= Fox News |title= Barry Bonds Hits Record 756th Career Home Run |date= August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1870–1913====
[[Image:1873Bostonteampicture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1873 Boston Red Stockings team picture: finished first with a record of 43–16]]
The [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], established in 1869 as the first professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Player-manager [[Harry Wright]] then went to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder [[Ivers Whitney Adams]], with brother [[George Wright (sportsman)|George]] and two other Cincinnati players, to form the nucleus of the '''Boston Red Stockings''', a charter member of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]]. The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/history/story_of_the_braves.jsp Atlantabraves.com History]&lt;/ref&gt; (The only other team that has been organized as long, the [[Chicago Cubs]], did not play for the two years following the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.) Two young players hired away from the [[Rockford Forest Citys|Forest City club]] of [[Rockford, Illinois]], turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher [[Albert Spalding|Al Spalding]] (founder of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods) and second baseman [[Ross Barnes]].

Led by the Wright brothers, Barnes, and Spalding, the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships. The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the &quot;'''Red Caps'''&quot; (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member). Boston came to be called the '''Beaneaters''' in 1883, while retaining red as the team color.

Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants. The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their [[manager (baseball)|manager]] was [[Frank Selee]]. The [[1898 Boston Beaneaters season|1898 team]] finished 102–47, a club record for wins that would stand for [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|almost a century]]. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the &quot;Heavenly Twins&quot;, [[Hugh Duffy]] and [[Tommy McCarthy]], as well as &quot;Slidin'&quot; [[Billy Hamilton (baseball)|Billy Hamilton]].

The team was decimated when the [[American League]]'s new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners didn't even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in ''The Sporting News Baseball Guide'' during the 1940s when each team's entry had a history of its nickname(s). See details in [[History of baseball team nicknames]]). The American League club's owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic &quot;Americans&quot;). Media-driven nickname changes to the '''Doves''' in 1907 and the '''Rustlers''' in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the '''Braves''' for the first time in [[1912 Major League Baseball season|1912]]. Their owner, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of [[New York City]]'s political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], which used an Indian chief as their symbol.

====1914: Miracle====
{{Main|1914 Boston Braves season}}

Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the [[1914 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, ''15 games'' behind the league-leading [[1914 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1914&amp;t=BSN 1914 Boston Braves Schedule by Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1914&amp;t=NY1 1914 New York Giants Schedule by Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Neft, Johnson and Deutsch, ''The World Series'', The Dial Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the [[1914 World Series|World Series]] as a heavy underdog to [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]]'s [[1914 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia A's]]. Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern [[World Series]] (the [[1907 World Series|1907 Series]] had one tied game)-to win the world championship. Meanwhile, [[Johnny Evers]] won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Chalmers Award]].

The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at [[Fenway Park]], since their normal home, the [[South End Grounds]], was too small. However, the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, [[Braves Field]], which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.

====1915–1953====
[[Image:Ruth1935.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ruth with the Boston Braves in 1935, his last year as a player]]
After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]] bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great [[Christy Mathewson]], back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.

Fuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager [[Bill McKechnie]], but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the [[Great Depression]].

Looking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the [[New York Yankees]] to acquire [[Babe Ruth]], who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Neyer|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Neyer|title=Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders|year=2006|publisher=Fireside|location=New York, New York|isbn=0743284917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, it looked like Ruth was the final piece the team needed in [[1935 Major League Baseball season|1935]]. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the [[1936 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He couldn't run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neyer&quot;/&gt;

Seeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted, in what remains one of the most memorable afternoons in baseball history, what turned out to be the last three [[home run]]s of his career. He'd wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neyer&quot;/&gt; The Braves finished 38–115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is [[List of worst MLB season records|the third-worst in baseball history]], and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 Cleveland Spiders]]).

Fuchs lost control of the team in August 1935,&lt;ref name=&quot;Neyer&quot;/&gt; and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the '''Boston Bees'''. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate [[Lou Perini]], changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. [[World War II]] slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of [[Warren Spahn]] to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.

In [[1948 Major League Baseball season|1948]], the [[1948 Boston Braves season|team]] won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and [[Johnny Sain]], who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, ''Boston Post'' writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:

:''First we'll use Spahn''
:''then we'll use Sain''
:''Then an off day''
:''followed by rain''
:''Back will come Spahn''
:''followed by Sain''
:''And followed''
:''we hope''
:''by two days of rain.''

The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as ''&quot;Spahn and Sain and pray for rain&quot;'', entered the baseball vocabulary. Ironically, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had a better record in games that Spahn and Sain ''did not'' start than in games they did. (Other sources include pitcher [[Vern Bickford]] in the verse. It would be parodied over half a century later, as ''Boston Globe'' columnist [[Dan Shaughnessy]] would describe the Red Sox rotation, featuring [[Pedro Martinez]] and [[Derek Lowe]], as &quot;Martinez and Lowe and three days of snow.&quot;) It was also parodied in New York, describing the Yankees rotation, featuring [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Mike Mussina]] comically as &quot;Unit and Moose and what's the use?&quot;

The [[1948 World Series]], which the Braves lost in six games to the [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]], turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to [[Milwaukee]], where the Braves had their top farm club, the [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Brewers]]. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. [[Bill Veeck]] had tried to move his [[Baltimore Orioles#St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] there earlier the same year (coincidentally, Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.

===Milwaukee (1953–1965)===
{{see also|History of the Atlanta Braves #Milwaukee}}
[[Image:MilwaukeeBaseballM.svg|thumb|right|120px|Milwaukee Braves cap logo]]
Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes. The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans. The success of the team was noted by many owners. Not coincidentally, the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[Baltimore Orioles#St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]], [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] would leave their original hometowns in the next five years.

As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers [[Eddie Mathews]] and [[Hank Aaron]] drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), while Spahn, [[Lew Burdette]] and [[Bob Buhl]] anchored the rotation. In [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]], the [[1957 Milwaukee Braves season|Braves]] celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP season]], as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run [[walk-off home run]] that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the [[1957 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first [[World Series]] win in over 40 years, defeating the [[1957 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] of [[Yogi Berra|Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle|Mantle]], and [[Whitey Ford|Ford]] in seven games. Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories, giving up only two earned runs.

In [[1958 Major League Baseball season|1958]], the [[1958 Milwaukee Braves season|Braves]] again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the [[1958 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP [[Bob Turley|Bob Turley's]] pitching. The [[1959 Major League Baseball season|1959 season]] saw the [[1959 Milwaukee Braves season|Braves]] finish the season in a tie with the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].

[[Image:MilwaukeeBraves5461.png|thumb|right|Milwaukee Braves logo (1953–1956)]]
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The [[1960 Major League Baseball season|1960 season]] featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], who ultimately were to win the [[1960 World Series|World Series]] that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]]. The [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961 season]] saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.

Aaron hit 45 [[home run]]s in [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]], a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. [[1963 in baseball|The next season]], Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23–7. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or &quot;[[first division (baseball)|second division]]&quot;, for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.

The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began, but fattened up on the expansion [[New York Mets]] and [[Houston Astros|Houston Colt .45s]]. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.

Perini sold the Braves to a [[Chicago]]-based group led by [[William Bartholomay]] in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor Ivan Allen, constructed a new $18 million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta Stadium]], which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the [[History of the Oakland Athletics#Kansas City (1955–1967)|Kansas City A's]] to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the [[1965 Major League Baseball season|1965 season]]. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966]], the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.

[[Eddie Mathews]] is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.

===Atlanta===
====1966–1974====
The Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966]], 77–85 in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|1967]], and 81–81 in [[1968 Major League Baseball season|1968]]. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in [[Boston]]. In [[1969 Major League Baseball season|1969]], with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever [[National League West]] Division title, before being swept by the &quot;[[1969 New York Mets season|Miracle Mets]]&quot; in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.

In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of [[Hank Aaron]]. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium (&quot;The Launching Pad&quot;), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in [[Rico Carty]] (in 1970) and [[Ralph Garr]] (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 – [[Darrell Evans]], [[Davey Johnson]] and, of course, Aaron.

By the end of the [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973 season]], Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. The [[1974 Major League Baseball season|next season]], it was only a matter of time before he set a new record. On April 4, opening day, he hit #714 in [[1974 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]] of the [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], while Ruth finished his career as a Boston Brave. In fact, until [[Barry Bonds]] eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by [[Babe Ruth]] in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.

====1976–77: Ted Turner buys the team====
In [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]], the team was purchased by media magnate [[Ted Turner]], owner of [[superstation]] [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially-strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was re-named [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]]. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself [[manager (baseball)|manager]], but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the [[1977 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] lost 2–1 to the [[1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] to bring their losing streak to 17 games).

Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fanbase. WTBS marketed the team as &quot;The Atlanta Braves: [[America's Team]]&quot;, a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially [[Southern United States|the South]]. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname &quot;Channel&quot; for pitcher [[Andy Messersmith]] and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired [[Braves TBS Baseball|Braves games]]. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.

====1978–1990====
After three straight losing seasons, [[Bobby Cox]] was hired for his first stint as manager for the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978 season]]. He promoted 22-year-old slugger [[Dale Murphy]] into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]], Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981 season]] and replaced with [[Joe Torre]], under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from [[Bob Horner]], [[Chris Chambliss]], pitcher [[Phil Niekro]], and short relief pitcher [[Gene Garber]] helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] award. Murphy also won a Most Valuable Player award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The [[1986 Major League Baseball season|1986 season]] saw the return of Bobby Cox as [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]. Also in 1986, the team stopped using their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-themed mascot, [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]].

====1991–2004: Successes and stars====
=====1991–1994=====
Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990 season]], replacing [[Russ Nixon]]. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]] began developing young pitchers [[Tom Glavine]], [[Steve Avery]], and [[John Smoltz]] into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the [[1990 Major League Baseball Draft|1990 MLB Draft]] to select [[Chipper Jones]], who has become one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, [[John Schuerholz]] was hired away from the [[Kansas City Royals]] as general manager.

The following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players [[David Justice|Dave Justice]], [[Ron Gant]] and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion [[Terry Pendleton]], the [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the [[1991 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The &quot;Worst to First&quot; Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a very tightly contested seven-game [[1991 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] only to lose the [[1991 World Series|World Series]], also in seven games, to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.

Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In {{mlby|1992}}, the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] returned to the [[1992 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and once again defeated the [[1992 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] in seven games, culminating in a [[Francisco Cabrera game|dramatic game seven win]]. [[Francisco Cabrera (baseball)|Francisco Cabrera]]'s two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory. It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the [[1992 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] however. In 1993, the Braves signed [[Cy Young Award]] winning pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]], leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball. The [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|1993 team]] posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], who won 103 games. The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the [[1993 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] to the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.

In 1994, in a realignment of the [[National League]]'s divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.&lt;ref name=Realignment/&gt; This realignment was the main cause of the team's [[Braves–Mets rivalry|heated rivalry]] with the [[New York Mets]] during the mid to late 1990s.&lt;ref name=RivalryWithMets/&gt;&lt;ref name=SubwaySeries&gt;{{cite book|title=The subway series: the Yankees, the Mets and a season to remember|year=2000|publisher=The Sporting News|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=0892046597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Wild Card to World Series|date=October 17, 2000|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=Murray Chass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|player's strike]] cut short the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 season]], prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] with 48 games left to play.

=====1995–2004=====
The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[1995 World Series]]. This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the &quot;[[Buffalo Bills]] of Baseball&quot; (January 1996 issue of ''Beckett [[Baseball Card]] Monthly''). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the {{wsy|1996}} and [[1999 World Series]] (losing both to the [[New York Yankees]]),&lt;ref name=SubwaySeries/&gt; and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization&amp;nbsp;—Cox was the Braves' manager, while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.

A 95–67 record in {{wsy|2000}} produced a ninth consecutive division title. However, a sweep at the hands of the [[2000 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] prevented the Braves from reaching the [[2000 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].&lt;ref name=SubwaySeries/&gt;

In {{mlby|2001}}, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the [[Houston Astros]] in the NLDS, then lost to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] four games to one. In {{mlby|2002}}, {{mlby|2003}} and {{mlby|2004}}, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the [[2002 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], and [[2006 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]].

=====Cy Young dominance=====
Six National League [[Cy Young Award]]s in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:
* In 1991, left-handed pitcher [[Tom Glavine]] received his first award.
* Right-handed pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] won three in a row with the Braves, from 1993 through 1995. His first award came in 1992 with the Cubs.
* In 1996, right-handed pitcher [[John Smoltz]] received his only Cy Young award.
* In 1998, Glavine won his second.

====2005: A new generation====
{{Main|2005 Atlanta Braves season}}

In [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], the Braves won the Division championship for the fourteenth consecutive time from 1991 to 2005. Fourteen consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ([[Wilson Betemit]], [[Brian McCann (baseball player)|Brian McCann]], [[Pete Orr]], [[Ryan Langerhans]], [[Jeff Francoeur]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, and pitcher [[Kyle Davies (baseball)|Kyle Davies]] all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the &quot;Baby Braves&quot; by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.

However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the [[2006 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] to the [[2005 Houston Astros season|Astros]] in four games. In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a [[Lance Berkman]] [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and a two-out, ninth inning [[Brad Ausmus]] home run off of Braves closer [[Kyle Farnsworth]]. The game didn't end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50&amp;nbsp;minutes. [[Chris Burke (baseball player)|Chris Burke]] ended the marathon with a home run off of [[Joey Devine]].

After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]], who left to go to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. [[Roger McDowell]] took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]], the Braves acquired shortstop [[Edgar Rentería]] from the Boston Red Sox.

====2006: Struggles====
{{Main|2006 Atlanta Braves season}}

In [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6–21 record for the month of June, the worst month ever in the city of Atlanta, and just percentage points better than the [[1935 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] of May 1935 (4–20).

The Braves made their move in July, going 14–10. However, the team remained in the bottom half of the NL East and trailed the [[2006 New York Mets season|Mets]] by a double-digit deficit for much of the season (13 games at the All-Star Break). However, despite their struggles, the Braves entered the break down by only six and a half games to the Dodgers for the NL Wild Card slot after winning seven of their last ten games.

After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the [[1897 Boston Beaneaters season|Boston Beaneaters]] totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the [[1930 New York Yankees season|1930 New York Yankees]] to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8–3 victory over [[2006 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20 game hitting streak and tie [[Paul Waner]]'s 69 year old Major League record with a 14 game extra-base hit streak.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting News Baseball Record Book'', 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Braves made their first trade of the season on July 20 to shore up the bullpen, sending Class A Rome catcher Max Ramirez to Cleveland for closer [[Bob Wickman]]. He served as the Braves' closer for the remainder of the season, taking over for an embattled [[Jorge Sosa]], who was subsequently traded on the July 31 trade deadline for St. Louis minor league pitcher Rich Scalamandre.

On July 29, the Braves traded reserve third baseman/shortstop [[Wilson Betemit]] to the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever [[Danys Baez]] and infielder [[Willy Aybar]]. The move came on the night that starting third baseman Chipper Jones went on the 15-day [[disabled list]] with a strained oblique muscle. With Betemit gone, the Atlanta called up infielder [[Tony Francisco Peña (baseball player)|Tony Pena Jr.]] from AAA Richmond to supplement Pete Orr.

Before the expansion of rosters on September 1, the Braves acquired [[Daryle Ward]] from the [[Washington Nationals]] for Class A Myrtle Beach pitcher [[Luis Atilano]], in hopes that he would be a valuable pinch-hitter in the postseason.

However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the [[2006 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves eleven year reign over the NL East. On September 24, the Braves' loss to the [[2006 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season.

Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie [[Chuck James]] besting [[Roger Clemens]], Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79–83.

After the season, the Atlanta coaching staff underwent a few changes. [[Brian Snitker]] became the third base coach after [[Fredi Gonzalez]] left to become the manager for the Florida Marlins. [[Chino Cadahia]] replaced [[Pat Corrales]] as bench coach and former catcher [[Eddie Pérez (baseball player)|Eddie Perez]] became the new bullpen coach, replacing [[Bobby Dews]].

====Sale to Liberty Media====
In December 2005, team owner [[Time Warner]], who inherited the Braves after purchasing [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]] in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/09/23/MN70161.DTL|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|date=23 September 1995|title=Time Warner Closes Deal for Turner|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/14/news/fortune500/braves_sale/|last=Isidore|first=Chris|date=14 December 2005|title=Time Warner considers Braves sale|publisher=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberty Media]] began negotiations to purchase the team.

In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to [[Liberty Media|Liberty Media Group]] (a company which owned a large amount of stock in [[Time Warner|Time Warner, Inc.]]), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, [[Bud Selig]]. The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450 million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980 million cash, for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media, then worth approximately $1.48 billion. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves. Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of &quot;active&quot; ownership in terms of day to day operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0505/089.html?boxes=custom Braves' New World – Forbes Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070516&amp;content_id=1969402&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl The Official Site of The Atlanta Braves: News: Atlanta Braves News]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007: More struggles====
{{Main|2007 Atlanta Braves season}}
&lt;!-- This section is intended as a summary of the entire season. Please do not add detailed information here. That should now go on the [[2007 Atlanta Braves season]] page, linked above. Thanks --&gt;

The Braves made their first moves by re-signing [[Bob Wickman]] to a one year deal and picking up [[John Smoltz]]'s option in September 2006. They traded starting pitcher [[Horacio Ramírez]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for pitcher [[Rafael Soriano]], an American League reliever with a 2.20 ERA in 2006. They also denied arbitration to pitcher [[Chris Reitsma]] and second baseman [[Marcus Giles]]. The Braves signed utility-man [[Chris Woodward]] to fill a spot on the bench. The biggest trade in the offseason involved first baseman [[Adam LaRoche]] and a minor league player for [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] closer [[Mike González (pitcher)|Mike González]] and a minor league infielder, [[Brent Lillibridge]]. Gonzalez, who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities in 2006, joined Soriano as a set-up man for Wickman in the bullpen. The team then signed [[Craig Wilson (first baseman)|Craig Wilson]] to a one year deal to platoon with [[Scott Thorman]]. The Braves also had solid relievers in [[Macay McBride]], [[Blaine Boyer]], and [[Tyler Yates]]. In addition, the majority of the Braves' offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 2007. However, [[Mike Hampton]] was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with yet another surgery. Mike González was later sidelined for the season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.

The Braves' bullpen and offense came through in the clutch early on, helping the Braves to a 7–1 start, their best start since winning the World Series in 1995. The team finished April with a 16–9 record, but struggled during May, finishing 14–14. The Braves also struggled during [[interleague play]], finishing with an NL-worst 4–11 record. On June 24, the Braves fell to .500 for the first time in the 2007 season, but rebounded by winning the next 5 games.

On July 5, Chipper Jones surpassed Dale Murphy for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting two against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On July 31, 2007, the Braves finalized the deal to acquire slugger first baseman [[Mark Teixeira]] and LHP Ron Mahay from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for catcher [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], SS [[Elvis Andrus]], and three minor-leaguers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070731&amp;content_id=2119864&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl |title=Braves finalize deal for slugger Teixeira |accessdate=2007-07-31 |author=Mark Bowman |date=2007-07-31 |publisher=MLB.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves also acquired [[Octavio Dotel]] from the [[Kansas City Royals]] for [[Kyle Davies (baseball)|Kyle Davies]] and also traded LHP [[Wilfredo Ledezma]] and RHP Will Startup to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Royce Ring]]. On August 19, 2007 John Smoltz passed [[Phil Niekro]] for 1st place on the Braves' all-time strikeout list. Braves manager Bobby Cox broke the all-time MLB record for most career ejections by a manager in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070814&amp;content_id=2148876&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb &quot;Cox breaks all-time ejections record&quot;]. MLB.com&lt;/ref&gt;

After struggling during the second half of the 2007 season, Atlanta finished over .500 and missed the post season again. On October 12, 2007, John Schuerholz stepped down as General Manager to take over as team president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2007-10-11-schuerholz-comment_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=GM Schuerholz was Braves' guiding force | first=Hal | last=Bodley | date=October 12, 2007 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant GM Frank Wren took over as General Manager.

====2008: Injury plagued====
{{Main|2008 Atlanta Braves season}}

In December 2007, the team announced it would not re-sign center fielder [[Andruw Jones]] (who later would sign with the Dodgers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=atl&amp;year=2007&amp;month=10 Atlanta.braves.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another major move was acquiring CF [[Gorkys Hernández]] and RHP [[Jair Jurrjens]] from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for SS [[Edgar Rentería]] and cash considerations. Next, LHP [[Tom Glavine]] was signed to a one-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=atl&amp;year=2007&amp;month=12 Atlanta.braves.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They also acquired LHP [[Will Ohman]] and INF [[Omar Infante]] from the Cubs in exchange for RHP [[Jose Ascanio]].

The team's first new move for 2008 was acquiring OF [[Mark Kotsay]] from the A's (to replace Jones) in exchange for RHP [[Joey Devine]], RHP [[Jamie Richmond]] and cash considerations. Days later, Wren traded [[Willy Aybar]], outfielder [[Tom Lindsey]], and infielder [[Chase Fontaine]] to the Rays in exchange for left-hand reliever [[Jeff Ridgway]].

Before the trade deadline the Braves traded 1B [[Mark Teixeira]] to the [[Los Angeles Angels]] for first baseman [[Casey Kotchman]] and minor league RHP [[Stephen Marek]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Jayson. [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3510042 &quot;Braves deal Teixeira to Angels for Kotchman, minor leaguer&quot;]. ESPN, July 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves failed to make the playoffs for the third straight season.

====2009: The return of solid pitching====
{{Main|2009 Atlanta Braves season}}

On December 4, 2008, the Atlanta Braves received [[Javier Vázquez]] and [[Boone Logan]], while the [[Chicago White Sox]] received prospects catcher [[Tyler Flowers]], shortstop [[Brent Lillibridge]], third baseman [[Jon Gilmore]] and pitcher [[Santos Rodriguez]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman. Mark.[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081204&amp;content_id=3701728&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl &quot;Atlanta adds Vazquez to new-look staff, Braves complete deal for durable veteran starter, reliever Logan&quot;]. mlb.com, December 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2009, the Braves signed Japanese pitcher [[Kenshin Kawakami]] to a three-year deal, and two days later signed free agent pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] to a four-year contract.

During the course of the offseason, the Braves signed veteran pitcher and former Brave [[Tom Glavine]], while losing long-time Brave [[John Smoltz]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]].

On February 25, 2009, just before the start of spring training, Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder [[Garret Anderson]]. The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade [[Josh Anderson (baseball)|Josh Anderson]] to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher [[Rudy Darrow]] on March 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090330&amp;content_id=4090204&amp;vkey=pr_det&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=det &quot;Tigers acquire Josh Anderson from Atlanta Braves&quot;] MLB.com, March 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2009, the Braves acquired [[Nate McLouth]] from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for prospects [[Jeff Locke]], [[Charlie Morton (pitcher)|Charlie Morton]] and [[Gorkys Hernández]]. They also released veteran pitcher Tom Glavine.

On July 10, 2009, the Braves traded outfielder [[Jeff Francoeur]] to the [[New York Mets]] for outfielder [[Ryan Church]]. On July 31, 2009, hours before the trade deadline, the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt [[Casey Kotchman]] to Boston and reacquired [[Adam LaRoche]], whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.

The Braves made a late-season surge, coming within 2 games of the wild card leading [[2009 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in late September. On October 1, 2009 with the Braves four games back, Colorado beat the [[2009 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] 9–2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.

====2010: Cox's last season====
{{Main|2010 Atlanta Braves season}}

The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a [[postseason]] berth for the first time since [[2005 Atlanta Braves season|2005]]. The Braves were once again skippered by [[Bobby Cox]], now in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since [[2000 Atlanta Braves season|2000]] when they won 16 in a row. On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place [[Philadelphia Phillies]] at [[Turner Field]] to take sole possession of first place in the [[National League East]] standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2010_05_31_phimlb_atlmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap MLB.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in [[2005 Atlanta Braves season|2005]]. On July 13, 2010 at the [[2010 MLB All-Star Game]] in [[Anaheim]], Braves catcher [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]] was awarded the [[MLB All-Star Game MVP Award|All-Star Game MVP Award]] for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the [[National League]] its first win in the All-Star Game since [[1996 MLB All-Star Game|1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100714&amp;content_id=12242524&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=rss_mlb MLB.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first Brave to win the MVP Award since [[Fred McGriff]] did so in 1994. The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire [[Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)|Álex González]], [[Rick Ankiel]] and [[Kyle Farnsworth]] from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Kansas City Royals]], giving up shortstop [[Yunel Escobar]], pitchers [[Jo-Jo Reyes]] and [[Jesse Chavez]], outfielder [[Gregor Blanco]] and three minor leaguers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5379421 Sports.espn.go.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5426623 Sports.espn.go.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman [[Derrek Lee]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100818&amp;content_id=13591374&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb MLB.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 2010 against the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Mike Minor (baseball)|Mike Minor]] struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=300822116 Scores.espn.go.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card. They lost to the [[2010 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the [[National League Division Series]] in four games. Every game of the series was determined by one run. After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4, Bobby Cox was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.

====2011: Fredi Gonzàlez era====
{{Main|2011 Atlanta Braves season}}

On October 13, 2010, the Atlanta Braves announced that [[Fredi González]] would replace long-time Braves manager [[Bobby Cox]] as manager of the team in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101012&amp;content_id=15605228&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;c_id=atl Braves act quickly, name Gonzalez skipper]&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement came just two days after the [[2010 Atlanta Braves season|2010 Braves]] were eliminated from the postseason. It was also announced that pitching coach [[Roger McDowell]], third-base coach [[Brian Snitker]], and bullpen coach [[Eddie Perez (baseball)|Eddie Perez]] would retain their current positions, while former hitting coach [[Terry Pendleton]] would replace [[Glenn Hubbard (baseball)|Glenn Hubbard]] as the first-base coach and newcomer [[Carlos Tosca]] would become the new bench coach. Hubbard and former bench coach [[Chino Cadahia]] were not offered positions on the new coaching staff. [[Larry Parrish]] was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010.

Players from the Braves' minor league teams such as Freddie Freeman and Brandon Beachy are playing regularly  with the big league club, while Julio Teheran has been called up for spot starts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/2010.shtml Atlanta team statistics for 2010], [http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/2011.shtml 2011]. baseball-reference.com.

==Major rivalries==
===Mets===
{{main|Braves–Mets rivalry}}

The Braves–Mets rivalry is a rivalry between two teams in the [[National League East]], featuring the Braves and the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref name=RivalryWithMets&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=Olson|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/07/08/2003-07-08_crazy_scene_at_shea_takes_lu.html?print=1&amp;viewall=1|title=Crazy scene at Shea takes luster off Mets-Braves rivalry|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=July 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the [[1969 National League Championship Series]], en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1990s, when division realignment put the Mets and the Braves in the same division,&lt;ref name=Realignment&gt;{{cite news|quote=The Pirates will switch from the East next season. They opposed the move last week when realignment was approved, but agreed to allow Atlanta to move to the East.|title=Pirates OK new realignment|date=September 16, 1993|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=USA Today|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pirates Relent on New Alignment|date=September 16, 1993|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|page=B14|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/sports/baseball-pirates-relent-on-new-alignment.html?pagewanted=print|authorlink=Murray Chass}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Braves became one of the most dominant baseball teams in professional baseball.

===Phillies===
While their rivalry with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] lacks the history and hatred of the Mets, it has been the more important one in the last decade.  After the Braves' 14 straight division titles, the Phillies have won the last four, starting in 2006.  While rivalries are generally characterized by mutual hatred, the Braves—Phillies deeply respect each other.  Each game played (and there are 18 games in 2011) is vastly important between these two NL East giants, but at the end of the day, they are very similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schultz|first=Jeff|title=If Braves send message to Phillies, it will be done nicely|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/jeff-schultz-blog/2011/04/07/if-braves-send-message-to-phillies-it-will-be-done-nicely/?cxntfid=blogs_jeff_schultz_blog|work=Jeff Schultz Column|publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Uniforms==
The Braves currently have four [[baseball uniforms|uniforms]]. The first is a white home [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] with Braves written across the breastplate. The away jersey is gray with Atlanta written across the chest. These uniforms have been worn since 1987, and are similar to the uniforms the Braves wore from 1946 to 1963.

Their alternate home jersey is a red jersey with Braves written across the chest. The red jerseys are only worn for Sunday home games, and they were worn when the Braves made the playoffs in 2005. On opening night of the 2008 season against the Nationals, they debuted an alternate navy blue away jersey with Atlanta written in the same navy blue with white outline.

There are three hats that the Braves wear; the standard game hat is one worn with the white home jerseys. It has a red brim and navy blue top with a white A on the front for Atlanta. The hat worn with the Red Jerseys is the same color scheme as the standard game hat but has a red A with a [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] across the A. The hat worn with the blue road jerseys and grey road jerseys has a navy blue top and brim with a white A on the front, similar to the team's away hat from 1966–1971.

The Braves have retired eight numbers in the history of the franchise, including most recently Greg Maddux's number 31 in 2009 and Tom Glavine's number 47 in 2010. Additionally, Hank Aaron's 44, and Jackie Robinson's 42, which is retired for all of baseball with the exception of Yankees' closer Mariano Rivera and Jackie Robinson Day&lt;ref&gt;Araton, Harvey (14 April 2010).

Retrieved June 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;, have also been retired.

On March 22, 2011 the Braves announced that [[Bobby Cox]] will be inducted into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame and have his number six retired at a luncheon on August 12, 2011. Afterward, an on-field ceremony will be held to recognize the long-time Braves manager before the scheduled game versus the [[2011 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110322&amp;content_id=17058046&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;c_id=atl|title=Braves to retire Cox's No. 6, add him to Hall|work=atlantabraves.com|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
{{Main|List of Atlanta Braves broadcasters|Braves TBS Baseball|Atlanta Braves Radio Network}}

After years of stability, the Braves have faced a period of transition in their radio and television coverage.

The 2007 season was the last for Braves baseball on the [[TBS (TV network)|TBS Superstation]]. TBS showed 70 games throughout the country, then cleared the decks to make way for a [[Major League Baseball on TBS|new national broadcast package]] that began in earnest with the 2007 postseason, and expanded to Sunday afternoon games in 2008. Until his dismissal in 2009, [[Chip Caray]], one of the Braves' current broadcasters, called [[play-by-play]] for the national package, which includes the [[Division Series]] every season and alternating coverage of the [[American League Championship Series]] and [[National League Championship Series]]. Braves baseball has been seen on TBS since it was WTCG in 1971 and has been a cornerstone of the national superstation since it began in 1976. [[WPCH-TV|WPCH-TV/Peachtree TV]], formerly WTBS Atlanta, will still carry Braves games after this point, but only in parts of the [[Southern United States]]. After the transfer of the channel's operations from Time Warner to [[Meredith Corporation]], all Peachtree TV games will be simulcast on [[Fox Sports South]] outside of the Peachtree TV coverage area, beginning in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanyherald.com/mlb/headlines/MLB_NOTEBOOK_FSN_reaches_agreement_with_Peachtree_TV_to_broadcast_45_Braves_games_in_2011_Ex-Braves_Jones_signs_with_Yanks_114343144.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004 season]], longtime radio flagship station [[WSB (AM)|750 WSB]] was replaced by [[WGST]] 640AM. Due to WGST's weak signal at night, which fails to cover the entire [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], all games began to be simulcast on [[FM radio]] when the rights were transferred. The games first appeared on 96.1 [[WKLS]] (formerly &quot;96rock&quot;) in 2005, but moved to [[country music]] station 94.9 [[WUBL]] (&quot;94.9 The Bull&quot;) in 2007 after WKLS underwent a change in format from [[classic rock]] to [[active rock]] and became [[WKLS|Project 9–6–1]]. As of the [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009 season]], the Braves returned to WKLS on the FM frequency but remained on WGST on AM. It was announced that for the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010 season]], the Braves will be flagshipped on [[WCNN]] 680 The Fan and in Atlanta on the AM dial and [[WNNX]] 100.5 FM.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release- [http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090302&amp;content_id=3904480&amp;vkey=pr_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl &quot;Atlanta Braves and Clear Channel Announce Move to Project 9–6–1 for 2009 Games.&quot;] March 2, 2009. Retrieved July 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlanta Braves radio network currently serves 134 radio stations across the [[Southern United States]], including 20 in [[Alabama]], 4 in [[Florida]], 68 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1 in [[Mississippi]], 13 in [[North Carolina]], 14 in [[South Carolina]], and 14 in [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/schedule/affiliates.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the radio announcers have been former Brewers announcer [[Jim Powell (sportscaster)|Jim Powell]] and [[Don Sutton]]. Sutton was released after the [[2006 in baseball|2006 season]] and called [[Washington Nationals]] games on television from 2007–2008, but he has since returned for the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/braves/stories/2009/01/27/braves_sutton.html?cxntlid=thbz_hm Sutton rejoins Braves’ broadcast team]&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime Braves voices [[Skip Caray]] and [[Pete Van Wieren]] were the primary play-by-play voices of Braves baseball until Skip's sudden death on August 3, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=441791 Sportingnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Wieren's retirement after the 2008 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081021&amp;content_id=3634597&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl Atlanta.braves.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On television, Chip Caray will serve as play-by-play announcer for all 105 games on both [[SportSouth]] (formerly [[Turner South]]) and the Sunday games shown on Fox Sports South, while doing a fraction of the 45 games shown on Peachtree TV. [[Joe Simpson (baseball)|Joe Simpson]] provides color commentary for games Caray announces, and serves as the play-by-play announcer for games on Peachtree TV that Caray does not work.  [[Tom Glavine]], who retired from the Braves following the [[2009 in baseball|2009 season]], is the second color commentator on Sunday home games on Fox Sports South.  Starting in [[2011 in baseball|2011]], [[Ron Gant]] and [[Brian Jordan]] will join the Peachtree TV broadcasting team.  Caray, Simpson, Glavine, Gant and Jordan will call games on Peachtree TV on a rotating basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/2011/03/27/young-hicks-conrad-make-braves-25-man-roster/?cxntfid=blogs_atlanta_braves_blog&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atari ST''' is a [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]] that was released by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1985 and commercially available from that summer into the early 1990s. The &quot;ST&quot; officially stands for &quot;Sixteen/Thirty-two&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Atari Computing|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv4n5/the_future.html|year=1989|month=December|work=[[STart Magazine]]|accessdate=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to the [[Motorola 68000]]'s 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals.

==Overview==
The Atari ST was part of the 16/32 bit generation of [[home computer]]s, based on the [[Motorola 68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], with 512&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] or more, and 3½&quot; double-sided double-density [[floppy disk]]s as storage (nominally 720 KB). It was similar to other contemporary machines which used the Motorola 68000, the Apple [[Macintosh]] and the Commodore [[Amiga]]. Although the Macintosh was the first widely available computer with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), it was limited to a monochromatic display on a smaller built-in monitor.

TCS #1 001 03/20/85 DRI SHIPS GEM - net.micro.atari - Google Groups]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first home computer with integrated [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] support.

The ST was primarily a competitor to the Apple Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga systems. This platform rivalry was often reflected by the owners and was most prominent in the [[Demo Scene]]. Where the Amiga had custom processors which gave it the edge in the [[computer game|games]] and video market, the ST was generally cheaper, had a slightly faster CPU, and had a high-resolution monochrome display mode, ideal for business and [[Computer-Aided Design|CAD]].

Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports it enjoyed success for running [[music sequencer|music-sequencer]] software and as a [[MIDI controller|controller]] of [[musical instrument]]s among amateurs and professionals alike, being used in concert by bands such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Fatboy Slim]], and 1990s UK dance act [[808 State]].

In some markets, particularly [[Germany]], the machine gained a strong foothold as a [[small business]] machine for [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[Desktop publishing]] work.

The ST was later superseded by the [[Atari TT]] and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] computers.

==Origins==
===Amiga contract===
The Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home-computer makers [[Atari, Inc.]] and [[Commodore International]]. [[Jay Miner]], one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]], tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small [[think tank]] called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new &quot;Lorraine&quot; chipset. The company, which was later renamed [[Amiga Corporation]], started selling video game controllers and games while it developed a Lorraine-based computer.

Amiga ran out of capital to complete Lorraine's development, and Atari, owned by [[Warner Communications]], paid Amiga to continue development work. In return Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named &quot;Mickey&quot;, and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed &quot;Minnie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html &quot;Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement&quot; and &quot;Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving [[Commodore International]] in January 1984 [[Jack Tramiel]] formed Tramel&lt;!--*Not* &quot;Tramiel&quot;--&gt; Technology with his sons and other ex-Commodore employees, and in April began planning a new computer. The company initially considered the microprocessor [[National Semiconductor]] [[NS320xx]] but was disappointed with its performance.{{r|3years}}{{r|chin19850128}} Tramiel learned that Warner wanted to sell Atari, which in mid-1984 was losing about a million dollars per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;timemag&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/22/magazine/a-78-million-year-steve-ross-defends-his-paycheck.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A $78 Million Year: Steve Ross Defends His Paycheck | first=Roger | last=Cohen | date=1992-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and world wide distribution network for his new computer, Tramiel negotiated with Warner in May and June 1984. He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new [[Atari Corporation]], Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets. This was intended to, in effect, bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.

One of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff and cancel almost all ongoing projects in order to review their continued viability. It was during this time in late July/early August that his representatives discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel&lt;!--*Not* &quot;Tramiel&quot;--&gt; Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga). Having heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered in to discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the  chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.

At Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the operating system developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the [[Amiga 1000]] with the Lorraine chipset&amp;mdash;designed by ex-Atari engineers&amp;mdash;in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Jeffrey |last = Daniels |author = Jeffrey Daniels |title = 3 Years With the ST |url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/threeyearsofst.html |work = START Magazine |publisher = James Capparell |page = 22 |date = Summer 1988 |accessdate = 2010-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jayminer&quot;&gt;[http://www.heartbone.com/comphist/JayMiner.html “Jay G. Miner - Visionary”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The operating system===
With the hardware design nearing completion, the team started looking at solutions for the [[operating system]]. Soon after the buyout, [[Microsoft]] approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to the platform, but the delivery date was out by about two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was [[Digital Research]], who were working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become [[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]]. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;/&gt;

Digital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the &quot;Monterey Team&quot; which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Leonard Tramiel was the Atari person overseeing &quot;Project Jason&quot;  (aka&amp;nbsp;— The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers.
The name came from the original designer and developer, Jason Loveman.  Tim Oren has [http://cd.textfiles.com/crawlycrypt1/program/books/progem/gemdos.15 an article] describing the history of the project, from his series &quot;Professional GEM.&quot;

[[Image:Atari TOS 1 0.png|right|TOS 1.0 with the GEM user interface]]
CP/M-68K was essentially a direct port of [[CP/M]]'s original, mature operating system. By 1985, it was becoming increasingly outdated in comparison to MS-DOS 2.0; for instance, CP/M did not support sub-directories. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new [[DOS]]-like operating system specifically for GEM, '''GEMDOS''', and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of [[Atari TOS|TOS]] ('''The Operating System''') and colloquially known as the ('''Tramiel Operating System'''). This was beneficial as it gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drive storage disks, plus programmers had function calls similar to the [[IBM PC]] DOS.

===Debut of the ST===
After six months of intensive effort following Tramiel's takeover, Atari announced the '''520ST''' at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] in January 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;/&gt; Due to its similarities to the original [[Apple Macintosh]] and Jack Tramiel's role in its development, it was quickly nicknamed the &quot;Jackintosh&quot;.&lt;ref name=chin19850128&gt;{{cite news|author=Chin, Kathy|title=Atari Announces Six New Computers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22commodore%20128%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=jackintosh&amp;f=false|work=InfoWorld|publisher=IDG|date=1985-01-28|accessdate=2011-03-19|pages=1, 15, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers were amazed by Atari's rapid development of the ST and its powerful features&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;/&gt;{{r|chin19850128}} but others were more skeptical, citing the ST's &quot;cheap&quot; appearance, the poor relations Commodore under Tramiel had had with software developers, and Atari's uncertain financial health.{{r|chin19850128}}{{r|chinsoft19850128}} The majority of software companies were hesitant to support another platform beyond the [[IBM PC]], Apple, and [[Commodore 64]], and some were unsure of whether to choose the ST or the Amiga.&lt;ref name=chinsoft19850128&gt;{{cite news|author=Chin, Kathy|title=Atari Promises Software For ST|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=jackintosh&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=jackintosh&amp;f=false
|work=InfoWorld|publisher=IDG|date=1985-01-28|accessdate=2011-03-19|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Atari was out of cash and its employees feared that Tramiel would shut the company down, the 520ST shipped during spring 1985 to the press and developers&lt;ref name=&quot;previewdate&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

  | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in early July 1985 for general retail sales, saving the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;/&gt; The machine had gone from concept to store shelves in a little under a year.  Atari had originally intended to release versions with 128&amp;nbsp;KB and 256&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM as the '''130ST''' and '''260ST''' respectively. However, with the OS loaded from floppy into RAM, there would be little or no room left over for applications to run.  The 260ST did make its way into Europe on a limited basis.

The ST could support a monochrome or color monitor.  The former was less expensive, and had a higher resolution with its 640×400. Due to its flicker-free operation at 72&amp;nbsp;Hz, the monochrome monitor was better suited to business applications. The hardware supported two different color resolutions, 320×200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640×200 with 4 out of 512 colors. Color was required by many games.

Early models shipped with ''TOS'' on disk, but were designed with [[read-only memory|ROM]] sockets to make for easy upgrading to the future ROM-based ''TOS''.  These became available only a few months later, and were included in all new machines, as well as being available to upgrade older machines.  By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an [[RF modulator]] (for TV display), a version known as the 520ST&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;.

Atari had originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS.  This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other [[Device file|devices]] simply by pointing to it.  However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping, and was included in software packages and later ST machines.  Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.

A limited set of GEM fonts were also included within the ROMs.  These fonts also featured two additions:

[[Image:ST BASIC - J.R. Bob Dobbs.gif|thumb|right|The face of J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs]]

* The standard 8x8 pixel graphical character set for the ST (the main in-ROM &quot;font&quot; for GEM, and text-mode TOS operations in color modes) contains, following all the standard numbers, letters, symbols and accented characters, four unusual characters. These can be placed together in a square, forming a basic but recognisable facsimile of the face of [[J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, the figurehead of the [[Church of the Subgenius]].
* Jack Tramiel chose to include the [[Hebrew alphabet]] with ST's ROM character set because of his Jewish heritage{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

On the plus side, the ST was less expensive than most machines, including the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh Plus]], and tended to be faster than most (''external link:'' [http://web.archive.org/web/20091026193531/http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/3015/16bit.html  price comparison]).  Largely as a result of the price/performance factor, the ST would go on to be a fairly popular machine, notably in European markets where the foreign-exchange rates amplified prices.  Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was &quot;power without the price.&quot;  In fact, an Atari ST and [[terminal emulation]] software was much cheaper than a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VT220]] terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.

==Description==
===Housing===
[[Image:Atari-520ST.jpg|thumb|The Atari 520ST]]
The 520ST was an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the [[Commodore 64]]. By the time the 520ST reached the market, however, consumers demanded a keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. For this reason, the 520ST was a fairly large and awkward computer console.{{Whom?|date=April 2011}}

Adding to this problem was the number of large cables needed to connect to the peripherals. This problem was addressed to some degree in the follow-on models which included a built-in floppy disk drive, though this addition resulted in the awkward placement of the mouse and joystick ports to a cramped niche ''underneath'' the keyboard.

Early 520ST owners became accustomed to the &quot;Atari Twist&quot; and the &quot;Atari Drop&quot; service procedures.  &quot;Atari Twist&quot; seemed to help discharge built-up static electricity (Atari soldered-down the metal shielding to fix the problem) while the &quot;Atari Drop&quot; appeared to help re-seat chips which may have become partially unseated over time.

The case design was created by Ira Valenski&amp;nbsp;— Atari's chief Industrial Designer.&lt;ref name=&quot;case&quot;&gt;
{{cite web
|title=The Atari Microbox
|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/16bits/falcon030/microbox/index.htm
|work=Atari Historical Society
|accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ST featured bold angular lines and was basically wedge shaped, with a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The majority of the machines had keyboards with soft tactile feedback and with rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The original 520ST design used an external floppy drive; the 1040ST-style case featured a built-in floppy drive. The power supply for the early 520ST was a large external brick while the 1040ST's was inside the machine.

[[Image:Atari520ST Interface.jpg|thumb|Atari 520ST ports]]

===Port connections===
The ST featured a large number of ports mounted at the rear of the machine.
*Standard ports:
**[[RS-232]]c serial port ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] male)
**[[Centronics printer port]] ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] female)
**[[joystick]]/mouse ports ([[D-subminiature|DE-9]] male)
**2 [[MIDI]] ports (5-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]])
[[Image:Atari st mouse.jpg|right|thumb|Atari ST mouse(2000)]]
*ST-specific ports:
**Monitor port (13-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]])
**ACSI (similar to [[SCSI]]) DMA port (for hard disks and laser printers)
**Floppy port
**ST cartridge port (for 128 KB [[ROM cartridge]]s)

Because of its [[parallel communication|bi-directional]] design, the Centronics printer port could be used for joystick input, and several games made use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.

Atari initially used single-sided [[floppy disk|disk drives]] that could store up to 360&amp;nbsp;KB.&lt;!-- Is this 360x10^3 bytes, or 360x2^10? --&gt;  Later drives were double-sided versions that stored 720&amp;nbsp;KB. Due to the early sales of so many of the single-sided drives, almost all software would ship on two single-sided disks instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating [[early adopter]]s. ST magazines wishing to cater to the entire audience while still supplying a large amount of material on a single cover disc had to adopt innovative custom formats to work around this problem. Another sticking point was that, while the Atari double-sided drive could read IBM-formatted disks, IBM PCs could not read Atari disks.  This was a formatting issue that was later resolved by third-party software formatters and TOS upgrades (1.44 and higher).

===STF and STFM models===
[[Image:Atari ST 1040.jpg|thumb|Atari 1040ST]]
Atari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the '''1040ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;''' (also written '''STF''').  The machine was generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided [[floppy drive]] into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external.  This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The 1040 shipped with 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM, and the same design was also used for the new 512 KB '''520STFM''', which replaced the earlier models in the market.  The early 'STF' machines lacked the 'M' modulator that allowed a TV to be used and would only work with a monitor.

The '''1040ST''' was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1&amp;nbsp;MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of ''[[Byte Magazine|BYTE]]'' in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;/&gt; However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan.  The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the ''XE series'' of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers.  A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Mega models===
Initial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market,&lt;ref name=&quot;3years&quot;/&gt; with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.

To address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the '''ST1'''. First debuted at Comdex, 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the '''Mega''', this new machine included a detached high-quality keyboard, stronger case (to support the weight of a monitor), and internal bus expansion connector. The upcoming [[SLM804]] [[laser printer]] would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It would attach to the Mega through the ST DMA port and have the Mega computer render the pages. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB (a 1 MB version, the '''Mega 1''' would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package, which received acclaim and was featured on the cover of Computer Shopper magazine.

A custom [[blitter]] co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the '''Mega 2''' and '''Mega 4''' machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly-written programs using the screen VDI commands could use the blitter seamlessly since GEM [[Application programming interface|API]] was a higher-level interface to ''TOS''.

==Later models==
For about the first four years, no major design changes in the ST [[platform (computing)|platform]] took place, as Atari focused on manufacturing problems and distribution.

===STE models===
In late 1989, [[Atari]] released the '''520ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''1040ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;''' (also written '''STE'''), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It featured an increased color palette of 4096 colors from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution — and even fewer in higher resolutions), [[Genlock]] support, and a graphics co-processor chip called [[Blitter]], which could quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics sprites) around in RAM. It also included a new 2-channels digital sound chip that could play 8-bit stereo samples in hardware at up to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz. Two enhanced joystick ports (EJP) were added (two normal joysticks could be plugged into each port with an adaptor), with the new connectors placed in more easily-accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in  Atari's [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] console, and are compatible.  RAM was now much more simply upgradable via [[SIMM]]s. Despite all of this, it still ran at 8&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]].

The STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some [[Application software|applications]] and [[Personal computer game|games]] written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Sometimes incompatibility could be solved by expanding the RAM. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behaviour with a few applications (such as the [[WYSIWYG]] word-processor application [[First Word Plus]]).

The STE was the first Atari with PCM audio, which was probably one of the most attractive features of the machine. It has the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples using the SDMA at the following frequencies: 6258&amp;nbsp;Hz, 12517&amp;nbsp;Hz, 25033&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50066&amp;nbsp;Hz, which also means that it was the first computer with built-in sampling frequencies above audio CDs, although, the resolution was still only 8 bit. The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes.

Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software were rare, generally being limited to serious art-, CAD-, or music applications, with very few games taking advantage of the hardware, since it was found on so few machines.

The last STE machine — the '''[[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]''' — was an STE in a grey [[Atari TT]] case that had a switchable 16&amp;nbsp;MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional [[Motorola 68881]] [[floating point unit|FPU]], built-in 3½&quot; floppy disk drive, [[VMEbus|VME]] expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's [[LocalTalk]]) and an optional built-in 3½&quot; hard drive.  It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44 MB floppy support, bug fixes).  It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.

===Atari TT===
{{Main|Atari TT030}}
In 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented '''Atari TT030''', based on a 32&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68030]] processor. The &quot;TT&quot; name (&quot;Thirty-two/Thirty-two&quot;) continued the nomenclature system as the 68030 chip had full 32-bit wide buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.

===Atari Falcon===
{{Main|Atari Falcon}}
The final ST computer was the multimedia-capable '''Atari Falcon030'''. Like the TT, this was also 68030-based, operating at 16&amp;nbsp;MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board [[Motorola 56000|Motorola 56001]] audio [[digital signal processor]].  The Falcon, like the [[Atari STE]], supports sampling frequencies above 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340&amp;nbsp;Hz, which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies. Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066&amp;nbsp;Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor was capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon used a 16-bit bus which affected performance, but also served to reduce its cost.  In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;.  Aftermarket upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.

Released in 1992, the Falcon was canceled by Atari the following year.  In Europe, C-Lab licenced the Falcon design from Atari, and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case).

==Aftermath==
In 1993, Atari cancelled development on the ST computers to focus on the [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]].

Following the exit of Atari from the computer market, [[Medusa Computer Systems]] manufactured some powerful 3rd-party Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used [[Motorola 68040|68040]] and [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors, based on multimedia (particularly audio, but also video), CAD, and office uses.

Despite the lack of a hardware supplier, there is a small active community dedicated to keeping the ST platform alive. There have been advancements in the operating system, software emulators (for Windows, Mac &amp; Linux), and some hardware developments. There are accelerator cards, such as the CT60 &amp; CT63, which is a [[68060]] based accelerator card for the Falcon, and there is the [[Atari Coldfire Project]], which aims at developing an Atari-clone based on the [[Coldfire]] processor. [[Milan Computer]] of [[Germany]] also made 68040 and 68060-based Atari clones that can run either Atari TOS 4.5 or Milan Computer's [[MultiOS]] operating system.

==Software==
=== Music / Sound ===
The ST was the first [[home computer]] with built-in [[MIDI]] ports, and there was plenty of MIDI-related software for use professionally in music studios, or by amateur enthusiasts. The popular Windows/Macintosh applications ''[[Cubase]]'' and ''[[Logic Pro]]'' originated on the Atari ST (the latter as ''Notator Logic'', preceded by ''Creator'', ''Notator'' and ''Notator-SL''). Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's ''KCS'', contained a &quot;Multi-Program Environment&quot; that allowed ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.&lt;ref&gt;http://tamw.atari-users.net/omega.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Music [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] software was popular on the ST, such as the ''TCB Tracker'', aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').

An innovative music composition program that combined the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) was called ''Quartet'' (after its 4-note polyphonic tracker, which displayed one monophonic stave at a time on colour screens).

Due to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition. The Microdeal [[Replay Professional]] product featured a sound sampler that cleverly used the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]. For output of digital sound, it used the on-board frequency output, set it to 128&amp;nbsp;kHz (inaudible) and then modulated the amplitude of that.

Another program that had good success on the ST platform was ''[[MasterTracks Pro (software)|MasterTracks Pro]]'' from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh.  When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format.  [[GVOX|GVox]] bought out Passport, and continues the program for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS]] along with the other Passport product, the notation program ''[[Encore (software)|Encore]]''.

In addition to the sound-sampling functionalities, the availability of software packages with MIDI support for music composition and efficient sound analysis contributed to make the Atari ST a forerunner of later computer-based all-in-one studios.

The ST's low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians:

*[[Atari Teenage Riot]] named itself after the brand and programmed most of their music on an Atari ST. Including the entire album ''Is This Hyperreal?'' (June, 2011).
*The [[Fatboy Slim]] album ''You've Come A Long Way, Baby'' has an Atari ST in the large foldout picture of Fatboy Slim's studio.
*Highly acclaimed [[electronic music]] artists [[Mike Paradinas]] and [[Luke Vibert]] started out writing music on Atari STs.
*[[Mike Oldfield]]'s album ''[[Earth Moving]]'''s album notes state that it was recorded using an Atari ST and C-Lab MIDI software.
*In the Paris performance of [[Jean Michel Jarre|Jean-Michel Jarré]]'s album ''Waiting for Cousteau'', musicians have attached Atari ST machines with unidentified MIDI software to their keyboards, as could be seen in the TV live show and video recordings.
*[[White Town]]'s &quot;[[Your Woman]]&quot;, which reached #1 in the UK singles charts, was created using an Atari ST.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- WHITE TOWN WAS FROM THE EP &quot;Abort, Retry, Fail?&quot;, A COMMON DOS (I.E. PC) ERROR MESSAGE AND ''NOT'' ONE YOU SEE ON AN ATARI. DOESN'T THIS THEN QUESTION WHETHER JYOTI WROTE IT ON ONE? --&gt;
*All the drums MIDI files for [[The Berzerker]]'s eponymous debut album were written on an Atari.

===Applications===
Also popular on the ST was professional [[desktop publishing]] software, such as ''[[PageStream]]'' and ''[[Calamus (DTP)|Calamus]]''; office tools such as word processors (''[[WordPerfect]]'', ''[[Microsoft Write]]'', ''[[AtariWorks]]'', ''[[WordWriter ST]]'', First Word &lt;small&gt;[shipped with the machine]&lt;/small&gt; and its Plus continuation, and others); spreadsheets (''[[3D-Calc]]'', ''[[LDW Power]]'', ''[[LDW Power 2]]'', ''[[LOGiSTiX Senior]]'', ''[[PowerLedger ST]]'', ''[[SwiftCalc ST]]'', ''[[VIP Professional]]'', and others); turnkey programs (''[[Mail-Pro]]'', ''[[Sales-Pro 6]]'', ''[[Video-Pro]]'', and others); database programs (''[[A-Calc Prime]]'', ''[[Data Manager]]'', ''[[Data Manager Professional]]'', ''[[DBMan V]]'', ''[[Base Two]]'', ''[[Informer II]]'', ''[[DB Master One]]'', ''[[SBT Database Accounting Library]]'' (''[[dLedger]]'', ''[[dInvoice]]'', ''[[dOrder]]'', ''[[dPurchases]]'', and ''[[dPayables]])'', ''[[Superbase Personal]]'', ''[[Superbase Professional]]'', ''[[Tracker ST]]'', and others); and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade (Campus CAD, DynaCADD, Leonard ST, Technobox CAD/2...) — all being largely targeted at, or even limited to owners of high-resolution monochrome monitors.

Graphics programs such as ''[[NEOchrome]]'', ''Degas'' &amp; ''Degas Elite'', ''Canvas'', ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'', and ''[[Cyber Paint]]'' (which author [[Jim Kent]] would later evolve into ''[[Autodesk Animator]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asterius.com/atari/cyberpaint.html The Antic Cyber Graphics Software and the Pre-History of Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max]&lt;/ref&gt; featured advanced features such as 3D design and animation. One paint program, ''[[Spectrum 512]]'', used the ST's rapid palette switching ability to expand the maximum number of colors to be displayed on-screen at once to 512&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asterius.com/atari/spectrum.html The Antic Cyber Graphics Software and the Pre-History of Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=80&amp;t=14210 Some more great Spectrum 512 pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; (up to 46 in each scan line&amp;nbsp;— the STE never had a Spectrum4096, but other more minor applications filled this speciality niche, one even going so far as to program the shifter chip to palette shift at a rate enabling a display of 19200 colours).

[[3D computer graphics]] applications (like ''[[Cyber Studio]]'''s ''CAD-3D'', which author Tom Hudson would later develop into [[Autodesk]] ''[[3ds Max|3D Studio]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.com/imaginit/1/rss/viewitem.asp?feedid=BLOGS_VISUAL_ALL&amp;guid=170 Dinner with Tom Hudson]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://analog.klanky.com/people.htm The People of ANALOG]&lt;/ref&gt;), brought 3D modelling, sculpting, scripting, and most important, [[computer animation]] (using [[Delta encoding|delta-compression]]) to the desktop. Video-capture and -editing applications using special video-capture 'dongles' connected using the cartridge port&amp;nbsp;— low frame rate, mainly silent and monochrome, but progressing to sound and basic colour (in still frames) by the end of the machine's life. At the end, Spectrum 512 and CAD-3D teamed up to produce realistic 512-color textured 3D renderings, but processing was slow, and Atari's failure to deliver a machine with a math coprocessor had Hudson and Yost looking towards the PC as the future before a finished product could be delivered to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asterius.com/atari/whatmight.html The Antic Cyber Graphics Software and the Pre-History of Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software development===
The Atari ST had a wide variety of languages and tools for development. 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, [[HiSoft]]'s Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal ([[OSS Personal Pascal]], Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), [[Modula-2]], C compilers (like [[Turbo C|Turbo C (Borland)]], Alcyon C, [[Lattice C]], [[Megamax C]], [[Mark Williams C]], [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU C]], Aztec C, AHCC (A Home Cooked C), [[LISP]], [[Prolog]], [[Logo programming language|Logo]], and many others.

The initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. At $5,000, this discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (no hardware) for  $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement).

The ST came bundled with a system disk that contained ''[[ST BASIC]]'', the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as ''[[GFA BASIC]]'', FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to actually be supplied as a ROM cartridge instead of on disc), and the relatively famous ''[[STOS BASIC programming language|STOS]]'', which then inspired and led to the creation of AMOS on the Amiga, and powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and an innumerable host of good quality shareware and public domain games. In the late years of the Atari ST Omikron.Basic was bundled with it in Germany.

Even novelty tools such as ''[[Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit|SEUCK]]'' were available.

===Games===
The ST enjoyed success in gaming due to low cost, fast performance and colorful graphics.

Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Doug Bell]], [[Jeff Minter]], [[Jez San]], and [[David Braben]]. The first real-time 3D role-playing computer game, ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'', was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like ''[[Falcon (computer game)|Falcon]]'' and ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator#History|Flight Simulator II]]'' made use of the enhanced graphics found in the ST machines, as did many arcade ports. One game, [[MIDI Maze]], used the [[MIDI]] ports to connect up to 16 machines for interactive networked play, this is sometimes said to have inspired modern [[Local area network|LAN]] games which became popular in the early 90s. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that had identical graphics and sound were often accused by computer game magazines of simply being ST ports.

:See ''[[List of Atari ST games]]'' and ''[[:Category:Atari ST games]]''.

===Utilities / Misc===
Utility software was available to drive hardware add-ons such as video digitisers. Office Productivity and graphics software was also bundled with the ST ([[HyperPaint II]] by [[Dimitri Koveos]], [[HyperDraw]] by [[David Farmborough]], [[3D-Calc]] spreadsheet by [[Frank Schoonjans]], and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of [[Electronic Arts]]).

There was a thriving output of [[public domain]] and [[shareware]] software which was distributed by, in the days long before public internet access, [[public domain software library|public domain software libraries]] that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up [[bulletin board system]]s.

Remarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid-'90s and the birth of the modern, publicly-accessible Internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard-storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical World Wide Web browser applications are available and usable on the ST.

There were also DOS emulators released in the late 80s.  ''PC-Ditto'' came in two versions, software-only-, and a hardware version that plugged into the cartridge slot or kludged internally.  After running the PC-Ditto software, you had to insert a DOS boot disk to load the system.  Both allowed you to run DOS programs in [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] mode, though much more slowly than on an [[IBM PC]]. Other options were the ''PC-Speed'' ([[NEC V30]]), ''AT-Speed'' ([[Intel 80286]]) and ''ATonce-386SX'' ([[80386SX|Intel 80386sx]]) hardware emulator boards.

==Technical specifications==
All STs were made up of both custom and commercial chips:

*Custom chips
**'''ST Shifter''' ''&quot;Video shift register chip&quot;''—Enabled bitmap graphics using 32 KB of contiguous memory for all resolutions. Screen address had to be a multiple of 256.
**'''ST GLU''' ''&quot;Generalized Logic Unit&quot;''—Control logic for the system used to connect the ST's chips. Not part of the data path, but needed to bridge chips with each other.
**'''ST MMU''' ''&quot;[[Memory Management Unit]]&quot;''—Enabled physical memory access up to 4 MB. Maps out the memory space in the ST.
**'''ST DMA''' ''&quot;[[Direct Memory Access]]&quot;''—Used for floppy and hard drive data transfers. Can directly access main memory in the ST.
*Support chips
**'''MC6850P ACIA''' ''&quot;Asynchronous Common Interface Adapter&quot;''—Enabled the ST to directly communicate with MIDI devices and keyboard (2 chips used). 31.25 kBaud for MIDI, 7812.5 bit/s for keyboard.
**'''MC68901 MFP''' ''&quot;Multi Function Peripheral&quot;''—Used for interrupt generation/control, serial and misc. control input signals. Atari TT030 had 2 '''MFP''' chips.

*[[Operating System]]: [[Atari TOS|TOS]] v1.00 ('''''T'''he '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem'') with the [[Graphical Environment Manager]] (GEM) WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) GUI

Very early machines included the OS on a floppy disk due to it not being ready to be burned to ROM (Like the [[Amiga 1000]] had)  This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) [[Read-only memory|ROM]] versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 KB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 KB code into RAM when booting the desktop).  Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS.  Soon after this change, most production models became ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;s, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 KB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 KB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS - 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an [[RF Modulator]] that allowed the machine to be hooked to a colour TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50&amp;nbsp;Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the '''520ST&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;''' (or '''520STM'''). Later '''F''' and '''FM''' models of the 520 had a built in [[double-sided disk]] drive instead of a single-sided one.

===ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;===
As originally released in the '''520ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;/1040ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;''':

*All of the features of the 520STFM/1040STFM
*Extended palette of 4,096 available colours to choose from
*[[BLiTTER]] chip for copy/fill/clear large data blocks in memory (fill rate 4 MB/s)
*Hardware-support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and split screen (using the Shifter video chip)
*DMA [[sound chip]] with 2-channels stereo 8-bit [[PCM]] sound at 6.25/12.5/25/50&amp;nbsp;kHz and stereo RCA audio-out jacks (using enhancements to the Shifter video chip to support audio shifting)
*[[National LMC 1992]] audio controller chip, allowing adjustable left/right/master volume and bass and treble EQ via a &quot;Microwire&quot; (3-bit serial) interface
*Memory: 30-pin [[SIMM]] memory slots ([[SIPP memory|SIPP]] packages in earliest versions) allowing upgrades up to 4 MB Allowable memory sizes including only 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MB due to configuration restraints (however, 2.5 MB is not officially supported and has compatibility problems). Later 3rd-party upgrade kits allow a maximum of 14MB [http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_url?doit=done&amp;tt=url&amp;intl=1&amp;fr=bf-home&amp;trurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stcarchiv.de%2Fstc1997%2F03_magnumst.php&amp;lp=de_en&amp;btnTrUrl=Translate w/Magnum-ST], bypassing the stock [[Memory management unit|MMU]] with a replacement unit and the additional chips on a separate board fitting over it.
*Ability to synchronise the video-timings with an external device so that a video [[Genlock]] device can be used without having to make any modifications to computer's hardware
*Analogue joypad ports (2), with support for devices such as paddles and light pens in addition to joysticks/joypads. The [[Atari Jaguar]] joypads and Power Pad joypads (gray version of Jaguar joypads marketed for the ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]]) can be used without an adapter. Two standard Atari-style digital joysticks could be plugged into each analogue port with an adapter.

==Models==
The members of the ST family are listed below, in rough chronological order:
;520ST: original model with 512&amp;nbsp;kB RAM.
;130ST: intended to be a 128&amp;nbsp;kB variant. Announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced.
;520ST+: early 520STs with 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM, but without floppy disk
;260ST: originally intended to be a 256&amp;nbsp;kB variant, but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512&amp;nbsp;KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512&amp;nbsp;KB models from the 1&amp;nbsp;MB models
;520ST&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output
;520ST&lt;sup&gt;FM&lt;/sup&gt;: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive
;1040ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;: a 520STFM with 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk, but without RF modulator
;1040ST&lt;sup&gt;FM&lt;/sup&gt;: a 520STFM with 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk with RF modulator
;Mega ST (MEGA2, MEGA4): redesigned motherboard with 2 or 4&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved &quot;[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]&quot; case with a detached keyboard. Early models did not include the BLiTTER chip; most did. Included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector.
;520ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; and 1040ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, the BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040 style all-in-one case
;4160ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;: as 1040ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; but with 4&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM. Never officially released except a small quantity of development units. Labels were sent out to dealers to affix to machines that had been upgraded to 4MB.
;[[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16&amp;nbsp;MHz processor, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in the TT case
;[[STacy]]: a [[portable computer|portable]] (but definitely not [[laptop]]) version of the ST. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard [[C battery|C cell]] flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut, and soon discontinued the machine.
;[[ST BOOK]]: a later portable ST, more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this&amp;nbsp;— notably the backlight, and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal [[flash memory]] 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a  desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light, it is fixed to the 640×400 1-bit mono mode, and no external video port was provided. For its limitations, it gained some popularity, particularly amongst musicians.

* [[Atari TT]]030—new machine based on the [[Motorola 68030]] processor running at 32&amp;nbsp;MHz, in yet another new case design with a detached keyboard. Capable of high screen resolutions with better colour palettes and addressing more memory, with optional onboard hard drive (slotting onto the base as a second, smaller box). Popular with CAD and DTP communities of the time for its sheer graphical capability (its high resolution only recently having become a common size on modern PCs) and processing speed.

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE RULES WHEN ADDING AN ENTRY:
  - Only projects that have achieved notability must be added. As per Wikipedia guideline (found at [[WP:MOSLIST]]), if an item is not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article of its own, it should not be added to a list. It's as simple as that.
  - Each entry must state the item name and a small one-line (but no larger) description.
  - The item name must be the project name if one is available, with only a secondary reference to the company name if any.
  - The item description should mention just how the project is a notable AI project.
  - Entries must be added in alphabetical order within the appropriate section.
  - Items with external links have been removed in the past, and so external links probably shouldn't be added. If you do, you risk the project getting removed from the list altogether.

Syntax:
* [[Item name]], item description. [Mandatory_RefLink1] [Optional_Ref2]
* Item name, item description. [Mandatory_RefLink1] [Optional_Ref2]

'''Aaliyah Dana Haughton''' (January 16, 1979 &amp;ndash; August 25, 2001), who performed under the [[mononymous person|mononym]] '''Aaliyah''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|l|iː|ə}}), was an American recording artist, actress and model. She was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, and was raised in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. At an early age, she appeared on the television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and performed in concert alongside [[Gladys Knight]]. At age 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].

Aaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album,  ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]''; it sold 3.7 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first major film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single &quot;[[Try Again]]&quot;. The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this feat. &quot;Try Again&quot; earned Aaliyah a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocalist.

After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her part in ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]''. She released her third and final album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'', in July 2001. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in an airplane crash in [[The Bahamas]] after filming the [[music video]] for the single &quot;[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]&quot;. The [[aviator|pilot]], Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and had traces of [[cocaine]] and [[alcohol]] in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. Since then, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases. Aaliyah recorded several number one [[R&amp;B]] hits and five top ten [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles. She has been credited for helping redefine [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], earning her the nickname &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of R&amp;B]]&quot;. She is listed by ''Billboard'' as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and 27th most successful R&amp;B artist overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/the-juice/the-top-50-r-b-hip-hop-artists-of-the-past-1004127916.story#/column/the-juice/the-top-50-r-b-hip-hop-artists-of-the-past-1004127916.story|title=The Top 50 R&amp;B / Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years|last1=Trust|first1=Gary|last2=Caulfield| first2=Keith|last3=Ramirez|first3=Rauly| date= November 18, 2010|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:3ACRPatrol(OIF3).jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. Army soldiers wearing [[ballistic vest]]s, accompanied by an armoured [[M3 Bradley]].]]

'''Armour''' or '''armor''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|spelling differences]]) is protective covering used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual or a vehicle through use of direct contact [[weapon]]s or [[projectiles]], usually during combat, or from damage caused by a potentially dangerous environment or action (e.g., cycling, sites of construction works). [[Personal armour]] is used to protect soldiers, and [[war animal]]s such as [[war horse]]s (the application for the latter called [[barding]]). [[Vehicle armour]] is used on [[warship]]s and [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s.

Armour has been used throughout [[recorded history]]. It has been made from a variety of materials; from rudimentary leather protection, personal armour evolved to mail and full plated suits of armour. For much of [[military history]] the manufacture of metal armour in Europe has dominated the technology and employment of armour. Armour drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood [[laminate|lamination]], mining, [[Refining (metallurgy)|metal refining]], vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the [[industrial revolution]], and influenced commercial development of metallurgy and engineering.

Armour was the single most influential factor in the development of [[firearms]] that revolutionised warfare. The first modern production technology for armour plating was used by navies in the construction of the [[Ironclad warship]], reaching its pinnacle of development with the [[battleship]]. It was also naval engineers that constructed the first [[tanks]] during World War I, giving rise to [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s. Aerial armour has been used to protect pilots and aircraft systems since the Second World War.

In modern ground forces' usage, the meaning of armour has expanded to include the role of troops in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] were mounted in armoured fighting vehicles and replaced [[light infantry]] in many situations. In modern armoured warfare, armoured units equipped with tanks and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s serve the historic role of both the [[heavy cavalry|battle cavalry]], [[light cavalry]] and [[dragoon]]s, and belong to the armoured branch.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;armour&quot; came into use in the Middle Ages as a borrowing from the French. It is dated from 1297, as a &quot;mail, defensive covering worn in combat&quot; from Old French ''armeure'', itself derived from the Latin ''armatura'' &quot;arms and/or equipment&quot; with the root ''arma'' &quot;arms or gear&quot;.

==Materials==
Over the centuries a wide variety of materials have been used to manufacture personal and vehicle protection, including: [[hides]], leather, [[bone]], [[linen]], [[laminated wood]], [[bronze]], [[Plate armour|iron plate]], [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolled steel]], and synthetic materials such as [[Kevlar]], [[Dyneema]] and [[ceramic]]s.

==Uses==
Armour has been used by all combat and many support Arms of Service, including: [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], [[warships]], [[armoured train]]s, aircraft, [[combat engineers]], [[military medicine]] troops, and on occasion improvised use by [[logistics]] troops.

===Personal===
{{Main|Personal armour}}

Types of personal armour include: [[ballistic vest]]s, [[combat helmet]]s, [[Ballistic face mask]]s and [[bombsuit]]s.

===Vehicle===
{{Main|Vehicle armour}}

Vehicle armour can shield ships, aircraft, and, most commonly, [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Savoyard armour IMG 3805.jpg|thumb|upright|Savoyard [[cuirassier]]'s armour&lt;!--Savoyan &quot;deaf head&quot; is the one of the most famous curiassier's armours type!--&gt;, ca. 1600–1610. On display at Morges military museum.]]

Since the 15th century, most parts of the [[human body]] have been fitted with specialised steel pieces, typically worn over linen or woollen underclothes and attached to the body via leather straps and buckles and points. Mail protected those areas that could not be fitted with plate; for example, the back of the knee. Well-known constituent parts of plate armour include the [[Combat helmet|helm]], [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]]s, [[gorget]] or 'neckguard', [[breastplate]], and [[greave]]s worn on the lower legs.

For the elite, full-body plate armour was custom-made for the individual. Most armour was bought off the shelf and some was modified to fit the wearer. The cost of armour varied considerably with time and place as well as the type of armour, coverage it provided and the cost of decoration. In the 8th century a suit of Frankish mail had cost 12 oxen; by 1600 a horseman's armour cost 2 oxen.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; A typical suit of full plate harness cost around 1 pound sterling in 14th century England&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearma.org/essays/quality-and-build.html Fight-Book Clues to Quality and Build of Knightly Weaponry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a man-at-arms in the same period made 1 shilling per day and so his armour cost about 20 days pay.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Plate armour was limited to those who could afford it: the nobility, landed classes and mercenary professional soldiers, who did most of the fighting in the Medieval period. Soldiers of lower standing generally wore less armour. Full plate armour made the wearer virtually impervious to sword blows as well as providing significant protection against arrows, bludgeons and even early firearms. Sword edges could not penetrate even relatively thin plate (as little as 1&amp;nbsp;mm). Also, although arrows shot from bows and crossbows and bullets fired from early [[hand cannon|firearms]] could occasionally pierce plate especially at close range, later improvements in the steel forging techniques and armour design made even this line of attack increasingly difficult. By its apex, hardened steel plate was almost impregnable on the battlefield. Knights were instead increasingly felled by [[polearm]]s such as the [[halberd]] and blunt weapons such as [[Mace (club)|maces]] or [[war hammer]]s that could send concussive force through the plate armour resulting in injuries such as broken bones, organ [[haemorrhage]] and/or head trauma. Another tactic was to attempt to strike through the gaps between the armour pieces, using daggers, spears and spear points to attack the [[man-at-arms|man-at-arms']] eyes or joints.

It is likely that a full suit of medieval plate must have weighed a little more than 60&amp;nbsp;lb (27&amp;nbsp;kg) on average; lighter than the equipment often carried by today's armies, which averages at around {{convert|90|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/call/call_01-15_ch11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|The [[Dendra panoply]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] armour, 1400 BC]]
[[File:Ancient Greek Armor in Metropolitan Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] armour in [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)]]

Significant factors in the development of armour include the economic and technological necessities of armour production. For instance, plate armour first appeared in Medieval Europe when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. Also, modern militaries usually do not equip their forces with the best armour available, since it would be prohibitively expensive. At times the development of armour has run parallel to the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.

===Development of personal armour===
Well known armour types in [[European history]] include the [[lorica hamata]] and the [[lorica segmentata]] of the [[Roman legions]], the [[mail (armour)|mail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel [[plate armour|plate harness]] worn by later [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[knight]]s, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914–15).

====Early armour====
In history, the use of armour was minor; often not more than a helmet and leg plates. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a (large) shield. Cuirasses were thus not used. Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were: the Aztecs (16th century DC), the [[hoplites]] in Ancient Greece, ...&lt;ref&gt;The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World by Brian M. Fagan&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, in East Asia, laminated armour such as [[lamellar armour|lamellar]], and styles similar to the [[coat of plates]], and [[brigandine]] were commonly used. Still later, around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used partial plates for &quot;important&quot; body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The &quot;Other&quot; body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, and/or Mountain pattern. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros. Chinese influence in Japan would result in the Japanese adopting Chinese styles, their [[Samurai|samurai armour]] being a result of this influence{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

[[Mail (armour)|Mail]], sometimes called by the [[neologism]] &quot;chainmail&quot;, made of interlocking iron rings, which may be riveted or welded shut is believed to have been invented by the [[Gauls|Gallic]] people in Eastern Europe about 500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} When these Gauls moved West they took mail with them. Most cultures who used mail used the Gallic word ''Byrnne'' or a variant, suggesting the Gauls as the originators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Gradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. Hardened leather and [[splint armour|splinted]] construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The [[coat of plates]] was developed, an armour made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat. 

Early plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th–15th century were made of iron. Iron armour could be [[Carburising|carburised]] or [[Case hardening|case hardened]] to give a surface of harder steel.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp.740–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Plate armour became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labour and labour had become much more expensive after the [[Black Death]], though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger [[Semi-finished casting products|bloom]]s. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

The small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the [[bascinet]], as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century.

[[File:Maximilienne-p1000557.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate armour]]

Probably the most recognised style of armour in the World became the [[plate armour]] associated with the [[knight]]s of the European [[Late Middle Ages]], but continuing to the early 17th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] in all European countries. 

By about 1400 the full harness of plate armour had been developed in armouries of Lombardy&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armour. 

In the early 15th century, advances in weaponry allowed infantry to defeat armoured knights on the battlefield. The quality of the metal used in armour deteriorated as armies became bigger and armour was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14–15th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15&amp;nbsp;kg, than by the late 16th century it weighed 25&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.916&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armour therefore gave substantial resistance.

In the early years of low velocity firearms, full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. In effect, rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebuseers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century. It was the only way they could be mounted and survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.

The horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate [[barding]]. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armour.

====Later armour====
Gradually starting in the mid-16th century, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers. 

Back and breast plates continued to be used throughout the entire period of the 18th century and through Napoleonic times, in many European (heavy) cavalry units, until the early 20th century. From their introduction, [[muskets]] could pierce plate armour, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire.

Though the age of the knight was over, armour continued to be used in many capacities. Soldiers in the American Civil War bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected body armour for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely- some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives, but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pp.74–5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of World War I, thousands of the French [[Cuirassier]]s rode out to engage the German Cavalry who likewise used helmets and armour. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against [[sabre]]s and light [[lance]]s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s like the foot soldiers, who at least had a [[trench]] to protect them.

===Development of vehicle armour===
The first ironclad battleship, ''[[French battleship La Gloire|La Gloire]]'', was launched by the [[French Navy]] in 1859;&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp.73–4&lt;/ref&gt; she prompted the British [[Royal Navy]] to start building ironclads. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first clashes of ironclads]] took place during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the [[Ship of the line|unarmoured line-of-battle ship]] as the most powerful warship afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas [[battleship]]s, coastal defence ships, and long-range [[cruiser]]s. The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel which carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea){{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible. 

The rapid pace of change in the ironclad period meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were complete, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the [[naval ram|ram]] or the [[torpedo]], which a number of naval designers considered the crucial weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ''ironclad'' dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or [[armoured cruiser]]s.

[[Armoured train]]s saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880–81 and 1899–1902), the [[World War I|First]] (1914–1918) and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] (1939–1945) and the [[First Indochina War]] (1946–1954). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–1920).

During the [[Second Boer War]] on 15 November 1899, [[Winston Churchill]], then a war-correspondent, was travelling on board an armoured train when it was ambushed by ''Boer commandos''. Churchill and many of the train's garrison were captured, though many others escaped, including wounded placed on the train's engine. 

Towards the end of World War I, armies on both sides were experimenting with plate armour as protection against [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and ricocheting projectiles. The first proposal for a tank was by the Austrian Oberleutenant [[Günther Burstyn]] who, in 1911, proposed a design for &quot;motor artillery&quot; (''Motorengeschütz'') with a turret, but his design never progressed beyond a German patent in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiNardo1986|DiNardo (1986)]], ''The First Modern Tank: Gunther Burstyn and His Motorgeschutz''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank or &quot;landship&quot; development, originally conducted by the British Navy under the auspices of the [[Landships Committee]] was sponsored by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]] and proceeded through a number of prototypes culminating in the [[Mark I tank]] prototype, named ''Mother''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Willmott2003&quot;&gt;[[#Willmott2003|Willmott (2003)]], ''First World War''&lt;/ref&gt; The first tank to engage in battle was designated ''D1'', a British [[Mark I tank|Mark I]], during the [[Battle of the Somme|Battle of Flers-Courcellette]] on 15 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan1993|Regan (1993)]], ''The Guinness Book of More Military Blunders'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to World War II, Germany fielded very few tanks during WWI, with only 15 of the [[A7V]] type being produced in Germany during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Willmott2003|Willmott (2003)]], ''First World War'', p.222&lt;/ref&gt; The first tank versus tank action took place on 24 April 1918 at [[Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux]], when three British [[Mark IV tank#Mark IV|Mark IV]]s met an advance of three German [[A7V]]s, supported by infantry. Tanks were knocked out on both sides, but the German attack failed and they retreated.

Mechanical problems, poor mobility and piecemeal tactical deployment limited the military significance of the tank in World War I and the tank did not fulfil its promise of rendering trench warfare [[obsolete]]. Nonetheless, it was clear to military thinkers on both sides that tanks would play a significant role in future conflicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmott2003&quot;/&gt;

The development of effective [[anti-aircraft artillery]] before the Second World War meant that the pilots, once the &quot;knights of the air&quot; during the First World War were left far more vulnerable to ground fire. This not only created the requirement for the introduction of the cockpit armour plating that eventually came to be known variously as the &quot;bucket&quot; or the &quot;bathtub&quot;, but also the design of such aircraft as the [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]] which also were heavily armoured to protect the fuel and engine, allowing much greater survivability during ground assaults.

===Present===
[[File:J20 riotcops dc.jpg|thumb|right|Riot police with body protection against blows]]

Today, [[ballistic vest]]s, euphemistically known as a [[flak jacket]], made of ballistic cloth (e.g. [[kevlar]], [[dyneema]], [[twaron]], [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|spectra]] etc.) and ceramic or metal plates are common among police forces, [[security guard|security staff]], [[prison officer|corrections officers]] and some branches of the military. 

The US Army has adopted [[Interceptor body armour]], which uses Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (E-S.A.P.I) in the chest, sides and back of the armour. Each plate is rated to stop a range of ammunition including 3 hits from a [[7.62×51 NATO]] AP round at a range of {{convert|10|m|0|abbr=on}}, though accounts in Iraq and Afghanistan tell of soldiers shot as many as seven times in the chest without penetration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} [[Dragon Skin body armour]] is another ballistic vest which is currently in testing with mixed results. 

Despite advances in the protection offered by ballistic armour against projectiles, as the name implies, modern ballistic body armour is much less impervious to '''stabbing''' weapons unless they are augmented with anti-knife/anti-stab armour (usually a form of [[Mail (armour)|mail]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}.

[[Riot police]] are usually equipped with armour against [[Strike (attack)|blows]].

[[File:Abrams-transparent.png|thumb|right|The [[United States Military|U.S. Military]]'s [[M1 Abrams]] [[Main battle tank|MBT]] uses [[composite armour|composite]], [[reactive armour|reactive]], and [[cage armour]]]]

Tank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms, now incorporating not only harder [[Composite armour|composites]], but also [[reactive armour]] designed to defeat [[shaped charge]]s. As a result of this, the [[main battle tank]] (MBT) conceived in the [[Cold War]] era can survive multiple [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle. The [[light tank]]s that were the last descendants of the [[light cavalry]] during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the World's military due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle-mounted infantry.

The [[armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) is a relatively recent development, stemming from trials and experiences during the Second World War. The APC allows the safe and rapid movement of infantry in a combat zone, minimising casualties and maximising mobility. APCs are fundamentally different from the previously used armoured [[half-track]]s in that they offer a higher level of protection from artillery [[Air burst|burst]] fragments, and greater mobility in more terrain types. The basic APC design was substantially expanded to an [[Infantry fighting vehicle]] (IFV) when properties of an armoured personnel carrier and a [[light tank]] were combined in one vehicle.

Naval armour has fundamentally changed from the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], [[bomb]]s and [[torpedo]]s. Passive defence naval armour for use against shells and other projectile weapons has almost completely disappeared on modern warships. It has been replaced by systems designed to detect and evade, or in the case of the [[cruise missile]]s, to destroy threats, including extensive use of [[radar]], [[sonar]] and [[electronic warfare]].

Although the role of the ground attack aircraft significantly diminished after the [[Korean War]], it re-emerged during the [[Vietnam War]], and in the recognition of this, the US Air Force authorised the design and production of what was later to become the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] dedicated anti-armour and [[ground-attack aircraft]] of the [[Cold War]].

Though the role of armour is less affective against other weapons such as rocket propelled grenades and other explosive, there has been a constant battle between armour and weapons, such as the sword and chain mail and plate armour, both used for different roles.

An '''armoured fighting vehicle''' (or '''armored fighting vehicle'''; '''AFV''') is a [[military vehicle]], protected by strong [[vehicle armour|armour]] and armed with [[weapon]]s. AFVs can be wheeled or tracked.

Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. This classification is not absolute; at different times different countries will classify the same vehicle in different roles. For example, ''[[armoured personnel carrier]]s'' were generally replaced by ''[[infantry fighting vehicle]]s'' in a very similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former.

Successful general-purpose armoured fighting vehicles often also serve as the base of a whole family of specialised vehicles, for example, the [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] and [[MT-LB]] tracked carriers, and the [[MOWAG]] [[MOWAG Piranha|Piranha]] wheeled AFV.

==History==
The first AFVs were [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], dating back virtually to the invention of the [[motor car]]. Such vehicles were largely used as scouting vehicles, and were armoured to protect the crew. The development of the AFV continued into [[World War 1]], when the tracked [[tank]] was introduced on the Western Front - a machine that was armoured because it was specifically designed to be fired upon. The tank proved highly successful, and as technology improved the tank became a weapon that could cross large distances at much higher speeds than supporting [[infantry]] and [[artillery]]. The need to provide the units that would fight alongside the tank led to the development of the wide range of AFVs that exist today, with most armies having vehicles to carry infantry, artillery and [[anti-aircraft weapon]]ry by the end of [[World War 2]]. Most modern AFVs are superficially similar in design to their WW2 counterparts, with significantly better armour, weapons, engines and suspension - however with an increase in the capacity of [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] allowing AFVs to be practically transported by air, many armies are replacing some or all of their traditional heavy vehicles with lighter airmobile versions, often with wheels instead of tracks.

== Design ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

=== Armour ===
{{Main|Vehicle armour}}
The level of armour protection between AFVs varies greatly - a [[main battle tank]] will normally be designed to take hits from other tank guns and anti-tank [[missile#Anti-tank|missiles]], whilst light [[reconnaissance]] vehicles are often only armoured &quot;just in case&quot;. Whilst heavier armour provides better protection, it makes vehicles less mobile (for a given engine power), limits its air-transportability, increases cost, uses more fuel and may limit the places it can go - for example, many bridges may be unable to support the weight of a main battle tank. A trend toward [[composite armour]] is taking place in place of steel - composites are stronger for a given weight, allowing the tank to be lighter for the same protection as steel armour, or better protected for the same weight. Armour is being supplemented with [[active protection system]]s on a number of vehicles, allowing the AFV to protect itself from incoming projectiles.

=== Weaponry ===
Weaponry varies by a very wide degree between AFVs - lighter vehicles for infantry carrying, reconnaissance or specialist roles may have only a [[machine gun]] for self-defence (or no armament at all), whereas heavy [[self propelled artillery]] will carry large guns, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] or [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]] launchers. These weapons may be mounted on a [[weapon mount#Pintle|pintle]], affixed directly to the vehicle or placed in a [[gun turret|turret]] or cupola.

The greater the recoil a weapon on an AFV is, the larger the turret ring needs to be. A larger turret ring necessitates a larger vehicle. To avoid listing to the side, turrets are usually located at the center of the vehicle on vehicles that are capable of amphibious operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brassey's&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Brassey's encyclopedia of land forces and warfare|year=1996|publisher=Brassey's|isbn=1-57488-087-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ipz0AzERg_MC&amp;dq=%22Main+battle+tank%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor=Franklin D. Margiotta|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grenade launcher]]s provide a versatile launch platform for a plethora of munitions including, [[Smoke grenade|smoke]], phosphorous, tear gas, illumination, anti-personnel, infrared and radar-jamming rounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brassey's&quot; /&gt;

Turret stabilization is an important capability because it enables firing on the move and prevents crew fatigue.

== Variants ==
=== Tank ===
[[File:Abrams-transparent.png|thumb|right|[[M1 Abrams|M1A2 Abrams]] with [[TUSK]]]]
{{Main|Tank}}

The tank is an all terrain AFV designed primarily to engage enemy forces by the use of [[indirect fire|direct fire]] in the frontal assault role. Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental days of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main [[artillery]] [[gun]], mounted in a fully rotating [[turret]] atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional machine guns throughout.

Philosophically, the tank is, by its very nature, a offensive weapon.  Being a protective encasement with at least one gun position, it is essentially a [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]] or small [[fortress]] (though these are static fortifications of a purely defensive nature) that can move toward the enemy - hence its offensive utility.

Historically, tanks are divided into 3 categories: [[Light Tank]]s (small, thinly armoured, weakly gunned, but highly mobile tanks intended for the armoured reconnaissance role), [[Medium Tank]]s (mid-sized, adequately armoured, respectably gunned, fairly mobile tanks intended to provide an optimum balance of characteristics for manoeuvre combat, primarily against other tanks), and Heavy Tanks (large, thickly armoured, powerfully gunned, but barely mobile tanks intended for the breakthrough role against fortified lines, particularly in support of infantry formations).  Other designations (such as Cavalry Tank, [[Cruiser Tank]], and [[Infantry Tank]]) have been used by various countries to denote similar roles.

A modern [[Main battle tank#Main battle tank (late twentieth century)|main battle tank]] incorporates advances in automotive, artillery, and armour technology to combine the best characteristics of all three historic types into a single, all around type. It is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era. It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but is fuel, maintenance, and ammunition-hungry which makes it [[Military logistics|logistically]] demanding. It has the heaviest [[Vehicle armour|armour]] of any vehicle on the battlefield, and carries a powerful weapon that may be able to engage a wide variety of ground targets. It is among the most versatile and fearsome weapons on the battlefield, valued for its [[fear|shock action]] against other troops and high [[survivability]]. Although it can be destroyed with [[anti-tank]] weapons, which are designed for destroying tanks.

=== Armoured car ===
[[File:HMMWV.JPG|thumb|right|[[Humvee|M1114 up-armoured Humvee]] in Iraq]]
{{main|Armored car (military)}}

The military's armoured car is a wheeled armoured vehicle, lighter than other armoured fighting vehicles, primarily being armoured and/or armed for self-defence of the occupants. Other multi-axled wheeled military vehicles can be quite large, and actually be superior to some smaller tracked vehicles in terms of armour and armament. They usually do not have attached weaponry. Armoured cars are often used in military marches and processions, or for the escorting of important figures.

{{Main|Armoured personnel carrier}}

[[Armoured personnel carrier]]s are intended to carry infantry quickly and relatively safely to point where they are deployed. In 1918, the British [[Mk V tank#Mark V series|Mk V tank]] was capable of carrying a small number of troops and in 1944, the Canadian general [[Guy Simonds]] ordered the conversion of redundant armoured vehicles to carry troops (generically named &quot;[[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]]s&quot;). This proved highly successful, even without training, and the concept was widely used in the [[21st Army Group]]. Post-war, specialised designs were built, culminating in the Soviet [[BTR-60]] and US [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]].

=== Infantry fighting vehicle ===

{{Main|Infantry fighting vehicle}}

An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is an armoured personnel carrier which can provide significant fire support. The first IFV was the Soviet [[BMP-1]], which surprised western intelligence analysts when it appeared in a military parade in 1967.

Modern [[IFV]]s are well-armed infantry carriers, differencing from earlier APCs by their heavier armament allowing them to give direct-fire support during an assault. Many also have firing ports allowing the infantry to fire [[firearms|personal weapons]] while mounted and improved [[vehicle armour|armour]]. They are typically armed with a twenty millimetre or larger [[autocannon]], and possibly with [[ATGM]]s. IFVs are usually [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category, too.

Specially-equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.

=== Artillery  ===
[[File:AS-90 self-propelled artillery.JPG|thumb|right|British [[AS-90]]s firing in [[Basra]], Iraq, 2006.]]
{{Main|Self-propelled artillery}}

Self-propelled [[artillery]] vehicles give mobility to [[artillery]]. Within the term are covered [[self-propelled gun]]s (or [[howitzer]]s) and [[rocket artillery]]. They are highly mobile, usually based on [[caterpillar track]] carrying either a large [[howitzer]] or other field gun or alternatively a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or some form of [[rocket]] or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range [[indirect-fire|indirect]] [[bombardment]] support on the battlefield.

In the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct fire vehicles such as [[assault gun]]s and [[tank destroyer]]s. These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles.

Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble [[tank]]s, but they are generally lightly armoured, too lightly to survive in direct-fire combat. However, they protect their crews against [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and small arms and are therefore usually included as armoured fighting vehicles. Many are equipped with [[machine gun]]s for defense against enemy infantry.

The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster.  Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought — usually towed — to the new location. By comparison self-propelled artillery can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.

Conversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach, so despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the [[arsenal]]s of many modern armies.

'''Anton Drexler''' (13 June 1884 – 24 February 1942) was a [[Germany|German]] political leader of the 1920s, known for being [[Adolf Hitler]]'s mentor during his early days in politics.

Born in [[Munich]], Drexler was a machine-fitter before becoming a railway [[locksmith]] in [[Berlin]] in 1902. He joined the [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]] during [[World War I]]. He was a poet and a member of the [[Völkisch movement|völkisch]] agitators who, together with journalist [[Karl Harrer]], founded the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich with [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Dietrich Eckart]] in 1919.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

At a meeting of the Party in Munich in September 1919, the main speaker was [[Gottfried Feder]]. When he had finished speaking, a member of the audience stood up and suggested that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and form a separate nation with [[Austria]]. [[Adolf Hitler]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mein&quot;&gt;Hitler, Adolf. ''Mein Kampf'', 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; sprang up from the audience to rebut the argument. Drexler approached Hitler and thrust a booklet into his hand. It was entitled ''My Political Awakening'' and, according to Adolf Hitler's writing in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', it reflected the ideals he already believed in. Later the same day Adolf Hitler received a postcard telling him that he had been accepted for membership of what was at that time the German Workers' Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mein&quot;/&gt; After some internal debate, he says, he decided to join.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Though Hitler was originally against the idea (but later convinced), Drexler changed the name of the party to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (''[[Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]]'' or NSDAP) early in 1920.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} By 1921, Adolf Hitler was rapidly becoming the undisputed leader of the Party. Drexler was thereafter moved to the purely symbolic position of honorary president, and left the Party in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise and Fall of the third Reich''. William Shirer. Pg 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler was also a member of a ''völkisch'' political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the [[Thule Society]]. His membership in the NSDAP ended when it was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], in which Drexler had not taken part. In 1924 he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for another party, in which he served as vice-president until 1928. He had no part in the NSDAP's refounding in 1925, and rejoined only after Hitler had come to power in 1933. He received the party's [[Blood Order]] in 1934 and was still occasionally used as a [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] tool until about 1937, but he was never again allowed any real power. He was largely forgotten by the time of his death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==In popular culture==
In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[Southern Victory Series]] of [[alternate history]] novels, the character Anthony Dresser appears to be based on Drexler.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the 2003 film ''[[Hitler: The Rise of Evil]]'', British actor [[Robert Glenister]] plays Drexler, although Drexler is portrayed without his trademark spectacles and moustache.

'''''All Quiet on the Western Front''''' ({{lang-de|Im Westen nichts Neues}}) is a novel by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], a German veteran of [[World War I]]. The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these soldiers upon returning home from the front.

The novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'', were among the books banned and burned in [[Nazi Germany]]. It sold 2.5 million copies in twenty-five languages in its first eighteen months in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the book was adapted as an Oscar-winning [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Lewis Milestone]].

==Title and translation==
The 1930 English translation by [[Arthur Wesley Wheen]] gives the title as '' All Quiet on the Western Front''.  The literal translation of &quot;Im Westen nichts Neues&quot; is &quot;Nothing New in the West,&quot; with &quot;West&quot; being the war front; the phrase refers to the content of an  official communiqué at the end of the novel. 

[[Brian O Murdoch|Brian Murdoch's]] 1993 translation would render the phrase as &quot;there was nothing new to report on the western front&quot; within the narrative.  Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase &quot;all quiet on the western front&quot; later became popular slang for lack of action, initially reference to the [[Phoney War]] on [[World War II]]'s [[Western Front (WWII)|Western Front]], but latterly in reference to anything from sport to politics.

==Plot summary==

The book tells the story of Paul Bäumer, a soldier who—urged on by his school teacher—joins the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]] shortly after the start of [[World War I]]. Bäumer arrives at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with his friends and schoolmates (Tjaden, Müller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, Bäumer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the dangerous and often squalid conditions of warfare.

At the very beginning of the book Erich Maria Remarque says &quot;This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.&quot; The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of [[artillery]] fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning less chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail. The battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for Bäumer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later.  Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. &quot;We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces.&quot;

Paul's visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does &quot;not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world.&quot;  He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him &quot;stupid and distressing&quot; questions about his war experiences, not understanding &quot;that a man cannot talk of such things.&quot;  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris, while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their &quot;own little sector&quot; of the war but nothing of the big picture. Indeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, &quot;Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you?  Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it.&quot;  In the end, he concludes that he &quot;ought never to have come [home] on leave.&quot;

Paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.
They are then sent on what Paul calls a &quot;good job.&quot; They must guard a village that is being shelled too heavily. The men enjoy themselves but while evacuating the villagers, Paul and Albert are wounded.

They recuperate in a Catholic hospital and Paul returns to active duty.

By now, the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.

==Themes==
One of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that &quot;[All Quiet on the Western Front] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.&quot; This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. When on leave from the front, Paul feels strongly isolated from his family and removed from daily life. Another topic concerns how soldiers' lives are put at risk by their commanding officers who seem unaware of the trauma of their charges.

==Major characters==
[[Image:AllQuietOnTheWesternFront.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of first English language edition. The design is based upon a German [[war bonds]] poster by [[Fritz Erler (painter)|Fritz Erler]].]]

===Paul Bäumer===
Paul Bäumer is the main character and narrator. At 19 years of age, Paul enlists in the German Army and is deployed to the Western Front where he experiences the severe psychological and physical effects of the war. 
Before the War, Paul was a creative, sensitive, and passionate person, writing poems and having a clear love for his family. But as the war changed his attitude and personality, poems and other aspects of his past life become something Paul could not remember having any link to, and he learns to disconnect himself from his feelings. He feels he can't tell anyone about his experiences, and feels like an outsider where his family is concerned.

By the end of the book, Paul realizes that he no longer knows what to do with himself and decides that he has nothing more to lose. The war appears to have snuffed out his hopes and dreams, which he feels he can never regain.

===Albert Kropp===
Kropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes an [[amputation]]. Both he and Bäumer end up spending time in a [[Roman Catholic]] hospital together, Bäumer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit [[suicide]] if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie. Kropp and Bäumer part ways when Bäumer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was &quot;very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter Ten of All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haie Westhus===
Haie is described as being tall and strong, and a [[peat]]-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie in addition has a good sense of humor. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6) — the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelstoss carries him to safety.

===Fredrich Müller===
Müller is about 18 and a half years of age, one of Bäumer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he &quot;mutters propositions in physics&quot;. He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel.  He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a flare gun. As he was dying &quot;quite conscious and in terrible pain&quot;, he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.

===Stanislaus Katczinsky===
Also known as Kat, he has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler in civilian life; he is older than Paul Bäumer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, Bäumer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.

Kat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, above all, food. At one point he secures four tins of lobster. Bäumer describes Kat as possessing a [[sixth sense]]. One night, Bäumer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse meat, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.

Kat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes Bäumer careless whether he survives the war or not, but that he can face the rest of his life without fear. &quot;Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear.&quot;

=== Tjaden  ===
One of Bäumer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelstoss (thanks to his strict 'disciplinary actions'), he manages to forgive Himmelstoss later in the book.  Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as &quot;thin as a rake.&quot; Tjaden appears as a well-liked school teacher in the sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'', but it is unclear whether he is the same person as in the prequel.

==Minor characters==
===Kantorek===
Kantorek was the [[schoolmaster]] of Paul and his friends, including  Kropp, Leer, and Müller. Behaving &quot;in a way that cost [him] nothing,&quot; Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages Bäumer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war. Kantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be grilled and taunted by Mittelstädt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.

===Peter Leer===
Leer is a soldier in Bäumer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. Bäumer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying &quot;Leer is an old hand at the game&quot;. In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, &quot;What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''All Quiet on the Western Front'' (London: Putnam &amp; Company Ltd, 1970 reprint), page 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bertinck===
Lieutenant Bertinck is the leader of Bäumer's [[Company (military)|company]]. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. He permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who would only allow them their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement. When he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hits by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.

===Himmelstoss===
Corporal Himmelstoss was a post-man before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment.  Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them &quot;hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough&quot; but most importantly it taught them comradeship.  However, Bäumer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front. Himmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul Bäumer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus' body to Bäumer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelstoss later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for Bäumer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.

===Detering===
Detering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, &quot;It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war,&quot; when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.

===Josef Hamacher===
Hamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a &quot;shooting license,&quot; certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his license so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.

===Franz Kemmerich===
Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, Bäumer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg had to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, Müller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone stole Kemmerich's watch from him, causing him great distress, prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends came to visit him in the hospital.

===Joseph Behm===
A student in Paul's class. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war. Eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in [[no man's land]] and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around [[no-man's-land]], it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
{{Main|All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)}}
In 1930, an American film of the novel was made, directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. The screenplay was by [[Maxwell Anderson]], [[George Abbott]], [[Del Andrews]], [[C. Gardner Sullivan]], with uncredited work by [[Walter Anthony]] and Milestone. It stars [[Louis Wolheim]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Arnold Lucy]] and [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]].

The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1930 for its producer [[Carl Laemmle Jr.]], and an [[Academy Award for Directing]] for [[Lewis Milestone]]. It was the first all-talking non-musical film to win the Best Picture Oscar. It also received two further nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], for [[Arthur Edeson]], and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing Achievement]] for Abbott, Anderson and Andrews.

In June 2009, an announcement was made that ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' will be remade.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016150/ IMDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The cast, crew, and director
will be announced before the film's shoot in late 2012. The remake is scheduled for release sometime in 2013 with [[Daniel Radcliffe]] starring as Bäumer.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

===TV film===
{{Main|All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)}}
In 1979, the film was remade for CBS television by [[Delbert Mann]], starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] of ''[[The Waltons]]'' as Paul Bäumer and [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Kat. Although filmed in color, instead of black and white as the earlier 1930 film adaptation was, the wasted and desolated landscapes and environment are very effectively conveyed. An overall element of bleakness prevails throughout.

===Radio===
On November 9, 2008, a radio adaptation was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]]. It starred [[Robert Lonsdale]] as Paul Bäumer and [[Shannon Graney]] as Katczinsky. It was dramatised by [[Dave Sheasby]] and directed by David Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fd2tv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elton John]]'s 1982 album, ''[[Jump Up!]]'' features the song, &quot;[[All Quiet on the Western Front (song)|All Quiet On The Western Front]]&quot; (written by Elton and [[Bernie Taupin]]).  The song is a sorrowful rendition of the novel's story (''&quot;It's gone all quiet on the Western Front '''/''' Male Angels sigh '''/''' ghosts in a flooded trench '''/''' As Germany dies&quot;'').

===Theatre===
In 2009, [[Nottingham Playhouse]] commissioned a play of the book by [[Robin Kingsland]] prior to a UK Tour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Academic elitism''' is a charge sometimes levied at [[academic institution]]s and academics more broadly, arguing that academia or academics are prone to undeserved and/or pernicious [[elitism]]; the term &quot;[[ivory tower]]&quot; often carries with it an implicit critique of academic elitism. Criticism of perceived academic elitism may or may not target [[intellectuals]] in general, [[academic institutions]] or education itself, but always{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} targets present leadership, practices and/or policies in academia.

== Description ==
[[Anti-intellectualism|Anti-intellectuals]] often perceive themselves as champions of ordinary people and as defenders of [[populism]] against [[elitism]], especially academic elitism -- e.g., some of economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s writings (''Intellectuals and Society'') suggest that while academics and intellectuals have done much valuable work, they also have an undeserved &quot;[[halo effect]]&quot; and face fewer disincentives than other professions against speak outside their expertise. These critics argue that highly educated people form an isolated social group whose views tend to be overrepresented amongst [[journalists]], [[professor]]s, and other members of the [[intelligentsia]] who often draw their salary and funding from taxpayers. Economist Dan Klein shows that the worldwide top-35 economics departments pull 76 percent of their faculty from their own graduates. He argues that the academic culture is pyramidal, not [[Polycentric law|polycentric]], and resembles a closed and genteel social circle. Meanwhile it draws on resources from taxpayers, foundations, endowments, and tuition payers, and it judges the social service delivered. The result is a self-organizing and self-validating circle.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that universities tend more to [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectualism]] than intellectualism per se; for example, to protect their positions and prestige, academics may over-complicate problems and express them in obscure language (e.g., the [[Sokal affair]], a hoax by physicist [[Alan Sokal]] attempting to show that American humanities professors invoke complicated, pseudoscientific jargon to support their political positions.) Some observers argue that, while academics often perceive themselves as members of an elite, their influence is mostly imaginary: &quot;Professors of humanities, with all their leftist fantasies, have little direct knowledge of American life and no impact whatever on public policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. (1992) ''Sex, Art and American Culture : New Essays'', ISBN 9780679741015, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Academic elitism suggests that in highly competitive academic environments only those individuals who have engaged in [[scholarly method|scholarship]] are deemed to have anything worthwhile to say, or do. It suggests that individuals who have not engaged in such scholarship are [[Crank (person)|cranks]].

It is also an ideological belief that only those who attended the most elite or prestigious universities (such as [[Ivy League]] schools, [[Grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]] or [[Oxbridge]]) are capable of obtaining wealth and power. Proponents of academic elitism justify this belief by claiming that this is just a by-product of [[capitalism]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'''African Americans''' (also referred to as '''Black Americans''' or '''Afro-Americans''', and formerly as '''American [[Negro]]es''') are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the [[Black people|black]] populations of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;censusblack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf |first=Jesse |last=McKinnon |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |format=PDF |title=The Black Population: 2000 United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the terms are generally used for Americans with at least partial [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry. Most African Americans are the direct descendants of captive Africans who survived the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery era]] within the boundaries of the present United States, although some are—or are descended from—immigrants from African, Caribbean, Central American or South American nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mumford1.dyndns.org/cen2000/BlackWhite/BlackDiversityReport/black-diversity03.htm |title=The size and regional distribution of the black population |accessdate=October 1, 2007 |publisher=Lewis Mumford Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective, the term is usually written as ''[[wikt:African-American|African-American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/African%20American |title=&quot;African American&quot; in the American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American history starts in the 17th century with indentured servitude in [[British America]] and progresses onto the election of [[Barack Obama]] as the [[List of US Presidents|44th]] and current [[President of the United States]]. Between those landmarks there were other events and issues, both resolved and ongoing, that were faced by African Americans. Some of these were slavery, [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]], development of the [[African-American culture|African-American community]], participation in the great [[Military history of African Americans|military conflicts of the United States]], [[racial segregation]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

The first recorded Africans in [[British North America]] (including most of the future United States) arrived in 1619 as [[indentured servant]]s who settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. As English settlers died from harsh conditions more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers. Africans for many years were similar in legal position to poor English indenturees, who traded several years labor in exchange for passage to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Hashaw |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The First Black Americans |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |work= |publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=January 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-147667728.html?Q=Jamestown |title=The shaping of Black America: forthcoming 400th celebration |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=2006-06-26 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They raised families, marrying other Africans and sometimes intermarrying with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or [[English American|English settlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |title=The First Black Americans – US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards.

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The first black congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]. By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalhousielodge.org/Thesis/scotstonc.htm |title=Dalhousielodge.org |publisher=Dalhousielodge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1770s, Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American Independence by defeating the British in the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/DIASPORA/REV.HTM |title=African Americans in the American Revolution |publisher=Wsu.edu:8080 |date=1999-06-06 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanamericans.com/MilitaryTimeline.htm |title=AfricanAmericans.com |publisher=AfricanAmericans.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Armistead]], an African American, played a large part in making possible the [[Siege of Yorktown|1781 Yorktown victory]], which established the United States as an independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/2007/blackhistmth/bios/01.html |title=Time.com |publisher=Time.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent African Americans were [[Prince Whipple]] and Oliver Cromwell, who are both depicted in the front of the boat in [[George Washington]]'s famous ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware|1776 Crossing the Delaware]]'' portrait.

By 1860, there were 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the United States due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and another 500,000 African Americans lived free across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm |last=Boddy-Evans |first=Alistair |title=The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade |work=African History |publisher=about.com |accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

[[File:Jesse Owens1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jesse Owens]] shook racial stereotypes both with Nazis and

{{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States|Jim Crow laws}}
African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools, community and civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, in the late 1890s, Southern states enacted [[Jim Crow laws]] to enforce [[racial segregation]] and [[disfranchisement after the American Civil War|disenfranchisement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creating Jim Crow: In-Depth Essay |last=Davis |first=Ronald L.F., Ph. D. |work=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]] |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most African Americans followed the Jim Crow laws, using a mask of compliance to prevent becoming victims of [[ethnic violence|racially motivated violence]]. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, African Americans such as [[Anthony Overton]] and [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] continued to build their own [[Historically black colleges and universities|schools]], [[Black church|churches]], banks, social clubs, and other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/surviving.htm |title=Surviving Jim Crow |last=Davis |first=Ronald, Ph. D |work=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States. These discriminatory acts included [[racial segregation]]—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] in 1896&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' {{Ussc|163|537|1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] from 1954 to 1968 was directed at abolishing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against African Americans, particularly in the [[Southern United States]]. The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Johnson put his support behind passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned [[discrimination]] in public accommodations, employment, and [[Trade union|labor unions]], and the Voting Rights Act (1965), which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections. By 1966, the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;abbeville&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |title=The March On Washington, 1963 |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |publisher=Abbeville Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically and economically, blacks have made substantial strides during the post-civil rights era. In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. There are currently two black governors serving concurrently; governor [[Deval Patrick]] of Massachusetts and governor [[David Paterson]] of New York. [[Clarence Thomas]] became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice.In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first black woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.

In 1790, when the first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the African American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as &quot;[[Freedman|freemen]]&quot;. By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million. In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South, but large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial violence. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million black people moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, [[New Great Migration|that trend reversed]], with more African Americans moving south to the [[Sun Belt]] than leaving it.

The following table of the African American population in the United States over time shows that the African American population, as a percentage of the total population, declined until 1930 and has been rising since then.

&lt;br /&gt;By 1990, the African American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html Time Line of African American History, 1881–1900].&lt;/ref&gt; In current demographics, according to 2005 U.S. [[Census]]{{Dubious|date=April 2009}}&lt;!-- there is no 2005 US census, only 2000--&gt; figures, some 39.9 million African Americans live in the United States, comprising 13.8% of the total population. [[The World Factbook]] gives a 2006 figure of 12.9%&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|us|United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy has surrounded the &quot;accurate&quot; population count of African Americans for decades. The NAACP believed it was under counted intentionally to minimize the significance of the black population in order to reduce their political power base.

At the time of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 54.8% of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and 18.7% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while only 8.9% lived in the [[Western United States|western]] [[US State|states]]. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin,&lt;ref name = &quot;tthqvu&quot;/&gt; many of whom may be of [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]], [[Afro-Cuban|Cuban]], [[Haitian American|Haitian]], or other [[Afro-Latin American|Latin American]] descent.

===U.S. cities===
{{See|List of U.S. cities with large African American populations|List of U.S. metropolitan areas with large African-American populations}}
Almost 58% of African Americans lived in [[metropolitan area]]s in 2000. With over 2 million black residents, New York City had the largest black [[urban area|urban]] population in the United States in 2000, overall the city has a 28% black population. Chicago has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.

Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Gary, Indiana]] had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2000, with 84% (though it should be noted that the 2006 Census estimate puts the city's population below 100,000). Gary is followed closely by [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which was 82% African American. Other large cities with African American majorities include [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] (67%), [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] (64%) [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] (61%), [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (61%), and Washington, D.C. (60%).

The nation's most affluent county with an African American majority is [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], with a median income of $62,467. Within that county, among the wealthiest communities are [[Glenn Dale, Maryland]] and [[Fort Washington, Maryland]]. Other affluent predominantly African American counties include [[DeKalb County, Georgia|Dekalb County]] in Georgia, and [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]] in Virginia. [[Queens|Queens County, New York]] is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African American middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post-civil rights era.

Nevertheless, due in part to the legacy of [[slavery]], [[racism]] and [[discrimination]], African Americans as a group remain at a pronounced economic, educational and social disadvantage in many areas relative to European Americans. Persistent social, economic and political issues for many African Americans include inadequate health care access and delivery; [[institutional racism]] and discrimination in housing, education, policing, [[criminal justice]] and employment; crime, poverty and [[substance abuse]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

One of the most serious and long standing issues within African American communities is poverty. Poverty itself is a hardship as it is related to marital stress and dissolution, health problems, low educational attainment, deficits in psychological functioning, and crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharacOfFam&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssw.unc.edu/RTI/presentation/PDFs/aa_families.pdf |title=Characteristics of African American Families |author=Oscar Barbarin, PhD |publisher=University of North Carolina |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 24.7% of African American families lived below the poverty level.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeNavas-Walt&quot;/&gt; In 2007, the average African American income was $33,916, compared with $54,920 for whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omhrc.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlID=51 |title=OMHRC.gov |publisher=OMHRC.gov |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and social issues===

The large majority of African Americans support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], Democrat [[John Kerry]] received 88% of the African American vote compared to 11% for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=2004 Election Results |publisher=CNN |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is an [[African-American lobby in foreign policy]], it has not had the impact that African American organizations have had in domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=American Society and the African American Foreign Policy Lobby: Constraints and Opportunities |first=David A. |last=Dickson |journal=Journal of Black Studies |year=1996 |pages=139–151 |volume=27|doi=10.1177/002193479602700201 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the [[sectionalism|sectional]] interests of the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]] were represented equally in both parties.

The African American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] program provided economic relief to African Americans; Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s.

After over 50 years, marriage rates for ''all'' Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.hoover.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817998721_95.pdf |title=psi:output_files:HPTHER$$$6.PS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes have been greatest among African Americans. After more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.hoover.org&quot;/&gt; Single-parent households have become common, and according to US census figures released in January 2010, only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/families_households/cb10-08.html Census Bureau Reports Families With Children Increasingly Face Unemployment], US Census Bureau, 15 January 2010. Retrieved 28 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that and heavy Democratic leanings, African Americans favor &quot;traditional American values&quot; about family and marriage.

While 52% of Democrats support same-sex marriage, only 30% of black Democrats do. In 2008, though Democrats overwhelmingly voted (64%) against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|the California ballot proposition banning gay marriage]], blacks overwhelmingly approved (70% in favor) it, more than any other racial group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/elections/story/1372009.html Sacbee.com]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-profile candidacy of Barack Obama is credited with increasing black turnout on the bill which has been seen as the crucial difference in its passing.&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/112807/Blacks-Conservative-Republicans-Some-Moral-Issues.aspx |title=Gallup.com |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blacks also hold far more conservative opinions on [[abortion]], [[Affair|extramarital sex]], and raising children out of wedlock than Democrats as a whole.&lt;ref name=social/&gt; On financial issues, however, African Americans are very much in line with Democrats, generally supporting a more [[progressive tax]] structure to provide more services and reduce injustice and as well as more government spending on social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/commentary/?analysisid=121 |title=People-Press.org |publisher=People-Press.org |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[News media]] coverage of African American news, concerns or dilemmas is inadequate, some activists and academics contend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackandbrownnews.com |title=BBN |publisher=blackandbrownnews.com |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608039 |title=Examining the Future of Black News Media |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608042 |title=How Will African Americans Get the News? |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Activists also contend that the news media present distorted images of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mikal Muharrar |title=Media Blackface |publisher=FAIR |date=September/ October 1998 |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1431}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this African Americans founded their own television networks. [[Black Entertainment Television]], founded by [[Robert L. Johnson]] is a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States.

Most programming on the network consists of [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] music videos and urban-oriented movies and series. Additionally, the channel shows syndicated television series, original programs, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET broadcasts a lineup of network-produced Christian programming; other, non-affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches 85 million viewers in the Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=63 |title=Mediaroom.com |publisher=Bet.mediaroom.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to BET there is [[Centric]], which is a spin-off cable television channel of BET, created originally as BET on Jazz to showcase [[jazz]] music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians. Programming since has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some R&amp;B, [[neo soul]], and [[alternative hip hop]], with the focus on jazz reduced to low-profile hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18 |title=Mediaroom.com |publisher=Bet.mediaroom.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]] is another African American-oriented network and a direct competitor to BET. It targets African American adults with a broad range of programming.

By 2000, African Americans had advanced greatly. They still lagged overall in education attainment compared to white or Asian Americans, with 14 percent with four year and 5 percent with advanced degrees, though it was higher than for other minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Issued August 2003: Educational Attainment by race and gender: Census 2000 Brief.&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans attend college at about half the rate of whites, but at a greater rate than Americans of Hispanic origin. More African American women attend and complete college than men. [[Black school]]s for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U.S., and a pattern towards re-segregation is currently occurring across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J.

[[Historically black colleges and universities]] remain today which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit African Americans. As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed high school, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]] has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as affirmative action, desegregation, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.closingtheachievementgap.org/cs/ctag/print/htdocs/home.htm Closing the Achivement Gap (California)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chicago, [[Marva Collins]], an African American educator, created a low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low-income African American children whom the public school system had labeled as being &quot;[[learning disabled]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvacollins.com/comments.html |title=Marva Collins Seminars, Inc |publisher=Marvacollins.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One article about Marva Collins' school stated,

Economically, African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights era]], particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole. The racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed. The black middle class has grown substantially. In 2000, 47% of African Americans owned their homes. The poverty rate among African Americans has decreased from 26.5% in 1998 to 24.7% in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeNavas-Walt&quot;/&gt; African Americans are the second largest consumer group in America with a combined buying power of over $892 billion currently and likely over $1.1 trillion by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizreport.com/2008/02/report_affluent_africanamericans_have_45_of_buying_power.html Report: Affluent African-Americans have 45% of buying power].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS218860+06-Feb-2008+PRN20080206 Buying Power Among African Americans to Reach $1.1 Trillion by 2012] [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 African American owned businesses accounted for 1.2 million of the US's 23 million businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/business_ownership/005477.html US Census Press Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, African American workers had the second-highest [[median]] earnings of American [[minority group]]s after [[Asian American]]s, and African Americans had the highest level of male-female income parity of all ethnic groups in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/acs-01.pdf |title=Incomes, Earnings, and Poverty from the 2004 American Community Survey |publisher=United States Census Bureau|month=August | year=2005 |accessdate=October 24, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, among American [[minority group]]s, only [[Asian American]]s were more likely to hold [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] occupations (management, professional, and related fields),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-25.pdf |title=Occupations: 2000 |author=Peter Fronczek and Patricia Johnson |publisher=United States Census Bureau |month=August | year=2003 |accessdate=October 24, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and African Americans were no more or less likely than European Americans to work in the service industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Pop-March 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p20-541.pdf |title=The Black Population in the United States: March 2002 |author=Jesse McKinnon |publisher=United States Census Bureau |month=April | year=2003 |accessdate=October 24, 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, over half of African American households of married couples earned $50,000 or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Pop-March 2002&quot;/&gt; Although in the same year African Americans were over-represented among the nation's poor, this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African American families headed by single women; such families are collectively poorer, regardless of ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Pop-March 2002&quot;/&gt;

By 2006, gender continued to be the primary factor in income level, with the median earnings of African American men more than those black and non-black American women overall and in all educational levels.&lt;ref name = &quot;census.gov-PINC03&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_131.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 131 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;census.gov-254&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_254.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 254 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;census.gov-259&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_259.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 259 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;census.gov-135&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_135.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 135 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_253.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 253 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, among American men, income disparities were significant; the median income of African American men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their European American counterparts, although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level.&lt;ref name=&quot;census.gov-PINC03&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_128.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 128 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the median earnings of African American men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their Asian American counterparts, and $1.17 for every dollar earned by Hispanic men.&lt;ref name = &quot;census.gov-PINC03&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;census.gov-135&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_133.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 133 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand by 2006, among American women with post-secondary education, African American women have made significant advances; the median income of African American women was more than those of their Asian-, European- and Hispanic American counterparts with at least some college education.&lt;ref name = &quot;census.gov-254&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;census.gov-259&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_005.htm |title=PINC-03-Part 5 |publisher=Pubdb3.census.gov |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans are still underrepresented in government and employment. In 1999, the median income of African American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and [[underemployment]], with the black underclass being hardest hit. The phrase &quot;last hired and first fired&quot; is reflected in the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] unemployment figures. Nationwide, the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11.1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm |title=BLS.gov |publisher=BLS.gov |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the nationwide rate was 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000 |title=BLS.gov |publisher=Data.bls.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The income gap between black and white families is also significant. In 2005, employed blacks earned only 65% of the wages of whites, down from 82% in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeNavas-Walt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carmen DeNavas-Walt, Bernadette D.

It noted that Queens was the only county with more than 65,000 residents where that was true.&lt;ref name=Queens&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/nyregion/01census.html Black Incomes Surpass Whites in Queens], The New York Times, October 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the rate of births to unwed African American mothers was estimated by economist [[Walter E. Williams]] of [[George Mason University]] to be 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams051999.asp Blaming the past], Walter Williams, May 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The poverty rate among single-parent black families was 39.5% in 2005, according to Williams, while it was 9.9% among married-couple black families. Among white families, the comparable rates were 26.4% and 6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams102705.asp Ammunition for poverty pimps] Walter E.

At the same time, the life expectancy gap is affected by collectively lower access to quality [[Health care|medical care]].

African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes, than whites, and twice as likely to die from the disease. Obesity affects 37% of men and 51% of women. This and other factors contribute to hypertension, which affects 40% of all adults. African American men are twice as likely to have diabetes induced end-stage kidney disease, and twice as likely to die of it than white men of the same age. African Americans are 1.7 times more likely to have a stroke and 60% more likely to die from it.

It has been estimated that &quot;184,991 adult and adolescent HIV infections [were] diagnosed during 2001–2005&quot; (1). More than 51 percent occurred among blacks than any other race. Between the ages of 25–44 years 62 percent were African Americans. Dr. Robert Janssen (2007) states, &quot;We have rates of HIV/AIDS among blacks in some American cities that are as high as in some countries in Africa&quot;. The rate for African Americans with HIV/AIDS in Washington, D.C. is 3 percent, based on cases reported. In a New York Times Article, about 50 percent of AIDS-related deaths were African American woman, which accounted for 25 percent of the city's population. In many cases there are a higher proportion of black people being tested than any other racial group. Dr. Janssen goes on by saying &quot;We need to do a better job of encouraging African Americans to test. Studies show that approximately one in five black men between the ages 40 to 49 living in the city is HIV-positive, according to the ''TIMES''. Research indicates that African Americans' sexual behavior is no different than any other racial group. Dr. Janssen says &quot;Racial groups tend to have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with members of their own racial group.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Race and crime in the United States|Crime]] also plays a significant role in the racial gap in life expectancy. A report from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] states &quot;In 2005, homicide victimization rates for blacks were 6 times higher than the rates for whites&quot; and &quot;94% of black victims were killed by blacks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm Homicide trends in the U.S.], U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence in the United States===
{{See|African American culture}}
[[Image:Jazzing orchestra 1921.png|thumb|300px|The King &amp; Carter [[Jazz]]ing Orchestra photographed in Houston, Texas, January 1921]]
From their earliest presence in North America, African Americans have contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, foods, clothing styles, music, language, social and technological innovation to American culture.
The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the U.S., such as [[Sweet potato|yams]], [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[grits]], [[watermelon]], [[indigo dye]]s, and [[cotton]], can be traced to African and African American influences. Notable examples include [[George Washington Carver]], who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 from pecans; and [[George Crum]], who invented the potato chip in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml |title=African-American Inventors |accessdate=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African American music]] is one of the most pervasive African American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], rock and roll, [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including [[blues]], [[doo-wop]], [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[ragtime]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].

African American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular musical genre in the world, including [[Country music|country]] and [[techno]]. African American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Earl L. |year=1998 |title=African American Music: An Introduction |isbn=0-02-860294-3 |page=3 |publisher=Schirmer Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. [[Bill T. Jones]], a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African American themes in his work, particularly in the piece &quot;Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land&quot;. Likewise, [[Alvin Ailey]]'s artistic work, including his &quot;Revelations&quot; based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, [[Stepping (African-American)|Stepping]], is an African American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Many African American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. [[African-American literature]] is a major genre in American [[literature]]. Famous examples include [[Langston Hughes]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Ralph Ellison]], Nobel Prize winner [[Toni Morrison]], and [[Maya Angelou]].

African American [[inventor]]s have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international [[innovation]]. [[Norbert Rillieux]] created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals. Moreover, Rillieux left [[Louisiana]] in 1854 and went to France, where he spent ten years working with the Champollions deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphics]] from the [[Rosetta Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inventions.org/culture/african/rillieux.html |title=Norbert Rillieux |publisher=Inventors Assistance League |accessdate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most slave inventors were nameless, such as the slave owned by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President Jefferson Davis who designed the ship propeller used by the Confederate navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sluby |first=Patricia Carter |title=The Inventive Spirit of African Americans: Patented Ingenuity |year=2004 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=0-275-96674-7 |pages=30–33 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wz-DTSXeLRYC&amp;pg=PA30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political legacy===
[[File:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] remains the most prominent political leader in the American civil rights movement and perhaps the most influential African American political figure in general.]]
African Americans have [[Military history of African Americans|fought]] in every war in the [[Military history of the United States|history of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48936 |title=Defenselink.mil |publisher=Defenselink.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gains made by African Americans in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights]] and Black Power movements not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]. They would often be the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post WWII era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to &quot;rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm |title=Martin Luther King, Jr |accessdate=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] marked a sea-change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it [[boycott]]s, [[sit-in]]s, demonstrations, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major [[political party|political parties]].

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, ''de jure'' racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the [[Free Speech Movement]], the disabled, women, Native Americans, and migrant workers.

==The term &quot;African American&quot;==
===Political overtones===
[[File:Michelle Obama official portrait crop.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Michelle Robinson Obama]] is the [[First Lady]] of the United States, the first African American to hold the position]]
The term African American carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to identify Americans of African ancestry were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry. The terms were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xoZ0POyF2YkC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=jesse+jackson+african+american+cultural+base |title=Books.Google.com |publisher=Books.Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20|isbn=9780292708730|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self-identification of their own choosing.

With the political consciousness that emerged from the political and social ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, blacks no longer approved of the term Negro. They believed it had suggestions of a moderate, accommodationist, even &quot;[[Uncle Tom]]&quot; connotation. In this period, a growing number of blacks in the United States, particularly African American youth, celebrated their blackness and their historical and cultural ties with the African continent. The Black Power movement defiantly embraced ''Black'' as a group identifier. It was a term social leaders themselves had repudiated only two decades earlier, but they proclaimed, &quot;[[Black is beautiful]]&quot;.

In this same period, a smaller number of people favored ''Afro-American'', a common shortening (as is 'Anglo-American'). However, after the decline in popularity of the 'Afro' hairstyle in the late 1970s, the term fell out of use.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the 1980s the term ''African American'' was advanced on the model of, for example, [[German-American]] or [[Irish-American]] to give descendents of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery-era]] a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and a cultural base.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after [[Jesse Jackson]] publicly used the term in front of a national audience. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Many blacks in America expressed a preference for the term, as it was formed in the same way as names for others of the many ethnic groups in the nation. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under [[Slavery|chattel slavery]], most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

For many, African American is more than a name expressive of [[culture|cultural]] and [[history|historical]] roots. The term expresses pride in Africa and a sense of kinship and solidarity with others of the [[African diaspora]]—an embrace of pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]].

===Who is African American?===
{{African American topics sidebar}}
Since 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government officially classified black people (revised to ''black'' or ''African American'' in 1997) as ''A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.''&lt;ref name=&quot;censusblack&quot; /&gt; Other Federal offices, such as the [[United States Census]] Bureau, adheres to the OMB standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |year=1997 |publisher=Office of Management and Budget}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the United States 2010 Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called ''2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan'' (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States&lt;ref name = &quot;US2010ICCBlkAud&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan |url= http://2010.census.gov/2010census/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan.pdf|archiveurl= |work= 2010 Census|publisher= U.S. Census Bureau|page= 225|format=PDF |date= August 2008|accessdate=May 5, 2009|quote = The Black audience includes all individuals of Black African descent. There are three major groups that represent the Black Audience in the United States. These groups are African Americans (Blacks born in the United States), Black Africans (Black Immigrants from Africa) and Afro-Caribbeans, which includes Haitians.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;US2010ICCBstRch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan.pdf|work= 2010 Census|publisher= U.S. Census Bureau|page=230|format=PDF |date= August 2008|accessdate=May 5, 2009|quote = Community, both geographic and ethnic, creates a sense of belonging and pride that is unique to the Black audience (African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and Black Africans).}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African American people as &quot;A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa&quot; through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 OMB classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBIpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigation |page=97 |year=2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The African-American experience===
Some black scholars have argued that the term &quot;African-American&quot; should refer strictly to the descendents of West or Central African slaves and free people of color who survived the slavery-era, and not the sons and daughters of black immigrants who lack that ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2007/01/22/obama/ |title=Colorblind - Barack Obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race -- if he were actually black | publisher= [[salon.com]] |author=Debra J. Dickerson |date=22 January 2007|accessdate=7 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument being that grouping all blacks together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery with in the American slave descendent community, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds.

In the book ''The End of Blackness'' published by author [[Debra Dickerson]], she warned against drawing favorable cultural implications from upwardly mobile black immigrants who are not the sons and daughters of American slavery and racial segregation. She used the political rise of President Barack Obama, who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, a result of &quot;Lumping us all together,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;colbertnation.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/81955/february-08-2007/debra-dickerson?videoId=81955 |title=The Colbert Report |author=Debra Dickerson |date=8 February 2007 |publisher=colbertnation.com |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickerson claimed it, &quot;erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress.&quot; On the liberal website [[Salon.com|Salon]] Dickerson wrote, &quot;African-American&quot;, in our political and social vocabulary, means those descended from West African slaves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;colbertnation.com&quot;/&gt;
Similar statements have been echoed by [[Stanley Crouch]] in a New York Daily News piece,[[Charles Kenzie Steele, Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2008/06/21/sclc_head_michelle_obama_treat.html Atlanta Journal Constitution: &quot;SCLC head: Michelle Obama treated more roughly than her husband, because of her slave heritage&quot;] June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American columnist [[David Ehrenstein]] of the [[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]] who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were &quot;[[Magic Negro]]s&quot;, a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro'&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Obama the 'Magic Negro' | date=March 19, 2007 | first=David | last=Ehrenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenstein went on to say &quot;He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro'&quot;/&gt;

Former Secretary of State [[Condolezza Rice]] (who was famously mistaken for a &quot;recent American immigrant&quot; by French President [[Nicholas Sarkozy]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,309218,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Nicolas Sarkozy Mistakes Condoleezza Rice for Recent Immigrant | date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; said &quot;descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that.&quot; She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African-Americans and instead prefers the term &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bbaaghs.org/news/?p=10 |title=Book Excerpt: Condoleezza Rice: An American Life |author=Elisabeth Bumiller |date=December 22, 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms no longer in common use===
The terms [[mulatto]] and [[colored]] were widely used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when they were considered outmoded and generally gave way to the use of ''negro''. By the 1940s, the term commonly was capitalized, but by the mid 1960s, it had acquired negative connotations, though the term ''mulatto'' is still in use in many parts of Latin America and is not considered offensive there. Today, in the culture of the United States, the term is considered inappropriate and is now rarely used and perceived as a pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tottie |first=Gunnel |title=An Introduction to American English |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&amp;pg=PA200 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-19792-3 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Talmadge |coauthors=James Stewart |title=Introduction to African American Studies |url=http://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&amp;pg=PA3 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Black Classics Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=1-58073-039-6 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Negro]] is largely out of use among the younger black generation, but is still used by a substantial block of older black Americans, particularly in the southern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/ |title=They Put 'Negro' on There? |author=Chris Good |date=March 26, 2010 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, ''negro'', which translates as ''black'' is the term generally used to refer and describe black people and, similarly to ''mulatto'', it is not considered offensive at all in these regions. However, it is pronounced differently, with the ''e'' being closer to the sound in the English word egg.

The '''Artistic License''' refers most commonly to the original Artistic License (version 1.0), a software [[license]] used for certain [[free and open source software]] packages, most notably the standard [[Perl]] implementation and most [[CPAN]] modules, which are [[dual-licensed]] under the Artistic License and the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). The original Artistic License was written by [[Larry Wall]]. The name of the license is a reference to the concept of [[artistic license]].

The terms of the Artistic License 1.0 were at issue in a 2007 [[United States district court|federal district court]] [[Jacobsen v. Katzer | decision]] in the US which was criticized by some{{Who|date=March 2009}} for suggesting that [[FOSS]]-like licenses could only be enforced through [[contract law]] rather than through [[copyright law]], in contexts where contract damages would be difficult to establish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawandlifesiliconvalley.blogspot.com/2007/08/new-open-source-legal-decision-jacobsen.html New Open Source Legal Decision: Jacobsen &amp; Katzer and How Model Train Software Will Have an Important Effect on Open Source Licensing], Radcliffe, Mark (Law &amp; Life: Silicon Valley) (2007-08-22)&lt;/ref&gt;  On appeal, a [[United States court of appeals|federal appellate court]] &quot;determined that the terms of the Artistic License are enforceable copyright conditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1001.pdf Opinion, Jacobsen v. Katzer], United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (2008-08-13)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The case was remanded to the District Court which did not apply the superior court's criteria (on the grounds that in the interim, the Supreme Court had changed the applicable law). However, this left undisturbed the finding that a free and open source license nonetheless has economic value.

== Artistic License 1.0 ==

Whether or not the original Artistic License is a [[free software license]] is largely unsettled. It was criticized by the [[Free Software Foundation]]
as being &quot;too vague; some passages are too clever for their own good, and their meaning is not clear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#NonFreeSoftwareLicense |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF recommended that the license not be used on its own, but approved the common AL/GPL [[dual-licensing]] approach for Perl projects.

In response to this, [[Bradley Kuhn]], who later worked for the Free Software Foundation, made a minimal redraft to clarify the ambiguous passages. This was released as the '''Clarified Artistic License''', and was approved by the FSF. It is used by the [[SNEeSe]] and [[FakeNES]] [[emulators]], the [[Paros Proxy]], the [[Dataflow programming|JavaFBP toolkit]] and [[NcFTP]].

== Artistic License 2.0 ==

In response to the [[Request for comments]] process for improving the licensing position for [[Perl 6]], Kuhn's draft was extensively rewritten by [[Roberta Cairney]] and [[Allison Randal]] for readability and legal clarity, with input from the Perl community. This resulted in the '''Artistic License 2.0''' which has been approved as both a [[free software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ArtisticLicense2 |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[open source]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nabble.com/License-Committee-Report-for-May-2007-tf3872801.html |title=Old Nabble - License Committee Report for May 2007 |publisher=Nabble.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; license.

It has been adopted by some of the [[Perl 6|Perl 6 implementations]], and has been used by the [[Parrot virtual machine]] since version 0.4.13.

The [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] recommends that all developers and projects licensing their products with the Artistic License adopt Artistic License 2.0. &lt;ref&gt;

'''Afrikaans''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]], spoken natively in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]]. It is a daughter language of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], originating in its 17th century dialects, collectively referred to as '''[[Cape Dutch]]'''.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Afrikaans is a daughter language of Dutch; see {{harvnb|Booij|1995|p=2}}, {{harvnb|Jansen|Schreuder|Neijt|2007|p=5}}, {{harvnb|Mennen|Levelt|Gerrits|2006|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Booij|2003|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Hiskens|Auer|Kerswill|2005|p=19}}, {{harvnb|Heeringa|de Wet|2007|pp=1, 3, 5}}.
&lt;br&gt;Afrikaans was historically called Cape Dutch; see {{harvnb|Deumert|Vandenbussche|2003|p=16}}, {{harvnb|Conradie|2005|p=208}}, {{harvnb|Sebba|1997|p=160}}, {{harvnb|Langer|Davies|2005|p=144}}, {{harvnb|Deumert|2002|p=3}}, {{harvnb|Berdichevsky|2004|p=130}}.
&lt;br&gt;Afrikaans is rooted in seventeenth century dialects of Dutch; see {{harvnb|Holm|1989|p=338}}, {{harvnb|Geerts|Clyne|1992|p=71}}, {{harvnb|Mesthrie|1995|p=214}}, {{harvnb|Niesler|Louw|Roux|2005|p=459}}.
&lt;br&gt;Afrikaans is variously described as a creole, a partially creolised language, or a deviant variety of Dutch; see {{harvnb|Sebba|2007|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Afrikaans borrowed from languages such as [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the [[Bantu languages]] or the [[Khoisan languages]], an estimated 90 to 95&amp;nbsp;percent of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin.{{#tag:ref|Afrikaans borrowed from other languages such as Portuguese, Malay, Bantu and Khoisan languages; see {{harvnb|Sebba|1997|p=160}}, {{harvnb|Niesler|Louw|Roux|2005|p=459}}.
&lt;br&gt;90 to 95&amp;nbsp;percent of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin; see {{harvnb|Mesthrie|1995|p=214}}, {{harvnb|Mesthrie|2002|p=205}}, {{harvnb|Kamwangamalu|2004|p=203}}, {{harvnb|Berdichevsky|2004|p=131}}, {{harvnb|Brachin|Vincent|1985|p=132}}|group=&quot;n&quot;}} Therefore, [[Differences between Afrikaans and Dutch|differences with Dutch]] often lie in a more regular morphology, grammar, and spelling of Afrikaans.{{#tag:ref|For morphology; see {{harvnb|Holm|1989|p=338}}, {{harvnb|Geerts|Clyne|1992|p=72}}. For grammar and spelling; see {{harvnb|Sebba|1997|p=161}}.|group=&quot;n&quot;}} There is a large degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between the two languages—especially in written form—although it is easier for Dutch-speakers to understand Afrikaans than the other way around.{{#tag:ref|Dutch and Afrikaans share mutual intelligibility; see {{harvnb|Gooskens|2007|p=453}}, {{harvnb|Holm|1989|p=338}}, {{harvnb|Baker|Prys Jones|1997|p=302}}, {{harvnb|Egil Breivik|Håkon Jahr|1987|p=232}}.&lt;br&gt;For written mutual intelligibility; see {{harvnb|Sebba|2007|p=116}}, {{harvnb|Sebba|1997|p=161}}.&lt;br&gt;It is easier for Dutch-speakers to understand Afrikaans than the converse; see {{harvnb|Gooskens|2007|p=454}}.|group=&quot;n&quot;}}

==Orthography==
There are many parallels to the [[Dutch orthography]] conventions and those used for Afrikaans. There are 26 letters.

In Afrikaans, many consonants are dropped from the earlier Dutch spelling. For example, ''slechts'' ('only') in Dutch becomes ''slegs'' in Afrikaans. Part of this is because the spelling of Afrikaans words is considerably more phonemic than that of Dutch. For example, Afrikaans and some Dutch dialects make no distinction between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, having merged the latter into the former; while the word for &quot;south&quot; is written ‹{{lang|nl|zuid}}› in Dutch, it is spelled ‹{{lang|af|suid}}› in Afrikaans to represent this merger. Similarly, the Dutch digraph ‹[[IJ (digraph)|ĳ]]› is written as ‹y›, except where it replaces the Dutch [[affix|suffix]] ''–lijk'', as in ''{{lang|nl|waarschijnlijk}} &gt; {{lang|af|waarskynlik}}''.

Another difference is the indefinite article, ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' in Afrikaans and {{lang|nl|''een''}} in Dutch. 'A book' is ''{{lang|af|'n boek}}'' in Afrikaans, whereas it is either ''{{lang|nl|een boek}}'' or ''{{lang|nl|'n boek}}'' in Dutch. This ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' is usually pronounced as just a [[weak vowel]], {{IPA|[ə]}}.

The [[diminutive]] suffix in Afrikaans is ‹-tjie›, whereas in Dutch it is ‹-tje›, hence a &quot;bit&quot; is {{Lang|af|''bie'''tjie'''''}} in Afrikaans and {{Lang|nl|''bee'''tje'''''}} in Dutch.

The letters ‹c›, ‹q›, ‹x›, and ‹z› occur almost exclusively in borrowings from [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. This is usually because words that had ‹c› and ‹ch› in the original Dutch are spelled with ‹k› and ‹g›, respectively, in Afrikaans. Similarly original ‹qu› and ‹x› are spelt ‹kw› and ‹ks› respectively. For example ‹{{lang|af|ekwatoriaal}}› instead of ‹equatoriaal›, and ‹{{lang|af|ekskuus}}› instead of ‹excuus›.

The vowels with diacritics in non-loanword Afrikaans are: ‹á, é, è, ê, ë, í, î, ï, ó, ô, ú, û, ý›. Diacritics are ignored when alphabetising, though they are still important, even when typing the diacritic forms may be difficult.

===Initial apostrophes===
A few short words in Afrikaans take initial apostrophes. In modern Afrikaans, these words are always written in lower case (except if the entire line is uppercase), and if they occur at the beginning of a sentence, the next word is capitalised. Three examples of such apostrophed words are ''{{lang|af|'k, 't, 'n}}''. The last (the indefinite article) is the only apostrophed word that is common in modern written Afrikaans, since the other examples are shortened versions of other words (''{{lang|af|ek}}'' and ''{{lang|af|het}}'' respectively) and are rarely found outside of a poetic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.101languages.net/afrikaans/grammar.html |title=Retrieved 12 April 2010 |publisher=101languages.net |date=2007-08-26 |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are a few examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Apostrophed Version!! Usual Version !! Translation !! Notes
|-
| 'n Man loop daar || || A man walks there || Standard Afrikaans pronounces &quot;'n&quot; as a [[schwa]] vowel.
|-
| 'k 't Dit gesê|| Ek het dit gesê || I said it ||Uncommon, more common: Ek't dit gesê
|-
| 't Jy dit geëet?|| Het jy dit geëet? || 'd You eat it? || Extremely uncommon
|}

The apostrophe and the following letter are regarded as two separate characters, and are never written using a single glyph, although a single character variant of the indefinite article appears in Unicode, {{Unicode|ŉ}}.

==History==
The Afrikaans language originated mainly from Dutch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A large number of [[List of South African slang words|unique slang words]] are present in Afrikaans as well. Despite this, it is still possible for a Dutch person to reasonably understand an Afrikaans person. It was considered a Dutch [[dialect]] in [[South Africa]] up until the late 19th century when it became recognised as a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keylanguages.com/new_english/afrikaans.html |title=Retrieved 12 April 2010 |publisher=Keylanguages.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relative majority of the first settlers whose descendants today are the [[Afrikaner]]s were from the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] (now [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]), though there were also many from [[Germany]], a considerable number from [[France]], and some from [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Scotland]], and various other countries.

The workers and slaves who contributed to the development of Afrikaans were [[Asian people|Asians]] (especially [[Malay race|Malay]]s), [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]s, as well as the [[Khoi]], [[Bushmen]] and [[Bantu people|Bantu]] peoples who also lived in the area. [[Creole peoples|African creole]] people in the early 18th century — documented on the cases of Hendrik Bibault and patriarch [[Oude Ram Afrikaner|Oude Ram]] — were the first to call themselves ''Afrikaner'' (Africans). This is where Afrikaans got its name from.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slavery&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Dialects===
Following early dialectical studies of Afrikaans, it was theorised that three main historical dialects probably existed after the [[Great Trek]] in the 1830s. These dialects are defined as the [[Afrikaans (Northern Cape dialect)|Northern Cape]], [[Afrikaans (Western Cape dialect)|Western Cape]] and [[Afrikaans (Eastern Cape dialect)|Eastern Cape]] dialects. Remnants of these dialects still remain in present-day Afrikaans although the standardising effect of Standard Afrikaans has contributed to a great levelling of differences in modern times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There is also a prison [[cant (language)|cant]] known as soebela, or sombela which is based on Afrikaans yet heavily influenced by [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. This language is used as a secret language in prison and is taught to initiates.&lt;ref&gt;Afrikaans 101 http://www.101languages.net/afrikaans/history.html Retrieved 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expatriate geolect====
Although mainly spoken in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], smaller Afrikaans-speaking populations live in [[Australia]], [[Botswana]], [[Canada]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[New Zealand]], [[Swaziland]], the [[United States]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, Afrikaans speaking people living outside of Africa are emigrants who have left South Africa. Because of [[emigration]] and migrant labour, there are possibly over 100,000 Afrikaans speakers in the [[United Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Standardisation===
The linguist Paul Roberge suggests that the earliest 'truly Afrikaans' texts are [[doggerel|doggerel verse]] from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveller in 1825. Printed material among the Afrikaners at first used only standard European Dutch. By the mid-19th century, more and more were appearing in Afrikaans, which was very much still regarded as a set of regional dialects.

In 1861, L.H. Meurant published his ''{{lang|af|Zamenspraak tusschen Klaas Waarzegger en Jan Twyfelaar}}'' (&quot;Conversation between Claus Truthsayer and John Doubter&quot;), which is considered by some to be the first authoritative Afrikaans text. [[Abu Bakr Effendi]] also compiled his [[Arabic Afrikaans]] [[Islamic]] instruction book between 1862 and 1869, although this was only published and printed in 1877. The first Afrikaans grammars and dictionaries were published in 1875 by the ''{{lang|af|[[Genootskap vir Regte Afrikaners]]}}'' ('Society for Real Afrikaners') in [[Cape Town]].

The [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars further strengthened the position of Afrikaans. The [[official language]]s of the [[Union of South Africa]] were English and Dutch until Afrikaans was subsumed under Dutch on 5 May 1925.

The main Afrikaans dictionary is the [[Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal (WAT)]] (Dictionary of the Afrikaans Language), which is as yet incomplete owing to the scale of the project, but the one-volume dictionary in household use is the [[Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal]] (HAT). The official [[orthography]] of Afrikaans is the ''Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls'', compiled by [[Die Taalkommissie]].

===The Afrikaans Bible===
{{Main|Bible translations (Afrikaans)}}
A major landmark in the development of Afrikaans was the full translation of the [[Bible]] into the language. Prior to this most Cape Dutch-Afrikaans speakers had to rely on the Dutch [[Statenbijbel]]. The aforementioned [[Statenvertaling]] had its origins with the [[Synod of Dordrecht]] of 1618 and was thus in an [[Archaism|archaic]] form of Dutch. This rendered understanding difficult at best to Dutch and Cape Dutch speakers, moreover increasingly unintelligible to Afrikaans speakers.

C. P. Hoogehout, [[:af:Arnoldus Pannevis|Arnoldus Pannevis]], and [[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit]] were the first [[Bible translations (Afrikaans)|Afrikaans Bible]] translators. Important landmarks in the translation of the Scriptures were in 1878 with C. P. Hoogehout's translation of the ''Evangelie volgens Markus'' ([[Gospel of Mark]], lit. Gospel according to Mark), however this translation was never published. The manuscript is to be found in the South African National Library, Cape Town.

The first official Bible translation of the entire Bible into Afrikaans was in 1933 by [[Totius (poet)|J. D. du Toit]], E. E. van Rooyen, J. D. Kestell, H. C. M. Fourie, and [[BB Keet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1983 there was a fresh translation in order to mark the 50th anniversary of the original 1933 translation and provide much needed revision. The final editing of this edition was done by E. P. Groenewald, A. H. van Zyl, P. A. Verhoef, J. L. Helberg and W. Kempen.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Afrikaans grammar}}

In Afrikaans grammar, there is no distinction between the [[infinitive]] and present forms of verbs, with the exception of the verbs 'to be' and 'to have':
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;
! infinitive form
! present indicative form
! Dutch
! English
! German
|-
|wees || is || zijn ([[imperative mood|imperative]]: wees) || be || sein
|-
|hê || het || hebben || have || haben
|}

In addition, verbs do not [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] differently depending on the subject. For example,
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;
! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German
|-
|ek is || ik ben || I am || ich bin
|-
|jy/u is || jij/u bent || you are (sing.) || du bist (informal sing.)
|-
|hy/sy/dit is || hij/zij/het is || he/she/it is || er/sie/es ist
|-
|ons is || wij zijn || we are || wir sind
|-
|julle is || jullie zijn || you are (plur.) || ihr seid (informal pl.)
|-
|hulle is || zij zijn || they are || Sie (formal sing. &amp; pl.)/sie sind
|}

The [[preterite]] looks exactly like the present but is indicated by adverbs like ''toe'', the exception being 'to be'.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;
! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German
|-
|ek was || ik was || I was || ich war
|}

The perfect is sometimes preferred over the preterite in literature where the preterite would be used in Dutch or English, for example, in the case of the verb ''to drink'':
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;
! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German
|-
|ek het gedrink. || ik dronk. || I drank. || ich trank.
|}

In other respects, the perfect in Afrikaans follows Dutch and English.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;
! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German
|-
|ek het gedrink || ik heb gedronken. || I have drunk. || ich habe getrunken.
|}

==Afrikaans phrases==
{{IPA notice}}
Afrikaans is a very centralised language, meaning that most of the vowels are pronounced in a very centralised (i.e. very [[schwa]]-like) way. Although there are many different dialects and accents, the transcription should be fairly standard.

|}

Note: The word Afrikaans means [[African]] (in the general sense) in the [[Dutch language]]. Since ''Afrikaans'' means ''African'' in Dutch, 'Zuid-Afrikaans' is a more common word for it, but is considered wrong, because in Afrikaans/Zuid-Afrikaans the only right word is ''Afrikaans''. This problem also occurs in Afrikaans itself, resolved by using the words Afrika and Afrikaan to distinguish from Afrikaans(e) and Afrikaner respectively.

Some Afrikaans sentences having the same meaning and written identically in English are:
* '''My hand is in warm water.''' ({{IPA|[məi hɑnt əs ən varəm vɑˑtər]}})
* '''My pen is in my hand.'''

'''Original (Suiwer Afrikaans) Onse Vader:'''

Onse Vader wat in die hemel is,
laat U Naam geheilig word;
laat U koninkryk kom;
laat U wil geskied op die aarde,
net soos in die hemel.
Gee ons vandag ons daaglikse brood;
en vergeef ons ons skulde
soos ons ons skuldenaars vergewe
en laat ons nie in die versoeking nie
maar verlos ons van die Bose
Want aan U behoort die koninkryk
en die krag
en die heerlikheid
tot in ewigheid. Amen

Afrikaans is the first language of over 80% of [[Coloured]] South Africans (3.5 million people) and approximately 60% of White South Africans (2.7 million). Around 200,000 black South Africans speak it as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/CinBrief/CinBrief2001.pdf |title=South African Census |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking and [[Anglo-African|English-speaking]] South Africans also speak it as their second language.

Some state that the term '''''Afrikaanses''''' should be used as a term for all people who speak Afrikaans, without respect to ethnic origin, instead of &quot;Afrikaners&quot;, which refers to an ethnic group, or &quot;Afrikaanssprekendes&quot; (lit. people that speak Afrikaans). Linguistic identity has not yet established that one term be favoured above another and all three are used in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vryeafrikaan.co.za/lees.php?id=115 Die dilemma van ‘n gedeelde Afrikaanse identiteit: Kan wit en bruin mekaar vind?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Distribution of Afrikaans in Namibia.png|thumb|left|Geographical distribution of Afrikaans in Namibia.]]

It is also widely spoken in Namibia, where it has had constitutional recognition as a national, but not official, language since independence in 1990. Prior to independence, Afrikaans had equal status with German as an official language. There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among Zimbabwe's white minority, as most have left the country since 1980. Afrikaans was also a medium of instruction for schools in [[Bophuthatswana]] [[Bantustan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armoria patriæ - Republic of Bophuthatswana|url=http://www.geocities.com/haigariep/BopE.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmVdolSf|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Africans living and working in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and [[Kuwait]] are also Afrikaans-speaking. There are Afrikaans websites, among them, news sites such as [http://www.nuus24.com/ Nuus24.com] and [http://www.sake24.com/ Sake24], and radio broadcasts over the web, such as those from [[Radio Sonder Grense]] and [[Radio Pretoria]].

Afrikaans has been influential in the development of [[South African English]]. Many Afrikaans loanwords have found their way into South African English, such as '[[bakkie]]' (&quot;pickup truck&quot;), '[[braai]]' (&quot;barbecue&quot;), 'tekkies' (&quot;sneakers&quot;). A few words in standard English are derived from Afrikaans, such as '[[aardvark]]' (lit. &quot;earth pig&quot;), '[[trek]]' (&quot;pioneering journey&quot;, in Afrikaans lit. &quot;pull&quot; but used also for &quot;migrate&quot;), &quot;spoor&quot; (&quot;animal track&quot;), &quot;veld&quot; (&quot;Southern African grassland&quot; in Afrikaans lit. &quot;field&quot;), &quot;commando&quot; from Afrikaans &quot;kommando&quot; meaning small fighting unit, &quot;boomslang&quot; (&quot;tree snake&quot;) and [[apartheid]] (&quot;segregation&quot;; more accurately &quot;apartness&quot; or &quot;the state or condition of being apart&quot;).

In 1976, high school students in [[Soweto]] began [[Soweto riots|a rebellion]] in response to the government's decision that Afrikaans be used as the language of instruction for half the subjects taught in non-White schools (with English continuing for the other half). Although English is the mother tongue of only 8.2% of the population, it is the language most widely understood, and the second language of a majority of South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/public_sector/govt_info_available_online_in_all_official_languages.html Govt info available online in all official languages - South Africa - The Good News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaans is more widely spoken than English in the Northern and Western Cape provinces, several hundred kilometers from Soweto. The Black community's opposition to Afrikaans and preference for continuing English instruction was underscored when the government rescinded the policy one month after the uprising: 96% of Black schools chose English (over Afrikaans or native languages) as the language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Black Linguistics: Language, Society and Politics in Africa and the Americas, by Sinfree Makoni, p. 120S.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constitution of South Africa|South Africa's Constitution]] of 1996, Afrikaans remains an official language, and has equal status to English and nine other languages. The new policy means that the use of Afrikaans is now, in effect, often reduced in favour of English, or to accommodate the other official languages. In 1996, for example, the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] reduced the amount of television airtime in Afrikaans, while [[South African Airways]] dropped its Afrikaans name ''{{lang|af|Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens}}'' from its [[livery]]. Similarly, South Africa's [[diplomatic mission]]s overseas now only display the name of the country in English and their host country's language, and not in Afrikaans.

In spite of these moves, the language has remained strong, and Afrikaans newspapers and magazines continue to have large circulation figures. Indeed, the Afrikaans-language general-interest family magazine ''[[Huisgenoot]]'' has the largest readership of any magazine in the country.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In addition, a pay-TV channel in Afrikaans called [[KykNet]] was launched in 1999, and an Afrikaans music channel, [[MK (channel)|MK]], in 2005. A large number of Afrikaans books are still published every year, mainly by the publishers Human &amp; Rousseau, Tafelberg Uitgewers, Struik, and Protea Boekhuis.

Afrikaans has two monuments erected in its honour. The first was erected in [[Burgersdorp]], South Africa, in 1893, and the second, better-known [[Afrikaans Language Monument]] (''{{lang|af|Afrikaanse Taalmonument}}'') was built in [[Paarl]], South Africa, in 1975.

When the British design magazine ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper&lt;!--&quot;Wallpaper&quot; per WP:MOSTM--&gt;]]'' described Afrikaans as &quot;one of the world's ugliest languages&quot; in its September 2005 article about the Monument, South African [[billionaire]] [[Johann Rupert]] (chairman of the [[Richemont|Richemont Group]]), responded by withdrawing advertising for brands such as [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] and [[Alfred Dunhill]] from the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20051210111130476C571280 Afrikaans stars join row over 'ugly language']{{dead link|date=May 2011}} ''[[Cape Argus]]'', December 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the article, Bronwyn Davies, was an [[English South African|English-speaking South African]].

Modern Dutch and Afrikaans share 85-plus per cent of their vocabulary. Afrikaans speakers are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short time. Native Dutch speakers pick up written Afrikaans even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar, whereas understanding spoken Afrikaans might need more effort. Afrikaans speakers can learn Dutch pronunciation with little training. This has enabled Dutch and Belgian companies to [[outsourcing|outsource]] their [[call centre]] operations to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eprop.co.za/news/article.aspx?idArticle=4739 &quot;SA holds its own in global call centre industry&quot;], eProp Commercial Property News in South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of Afrikaans==
[[Post-apartheid South Africa]] has seen a loss of preferential treatment by the government for Afrikaans, in terms of education, social events, media (TV and Radio), and general status throughout the country, given that it now shares its place as official language with ten other languages. Nevertheless, Afrikaans remains more prevalent in the media - radio, newspapers and television&lt;ref&gt;Oranje FM, Radio Sonder Grense, Jacaranda FM, Radio Pretoria, Rapport, Beeld, Die Burger, Die Son, Afrikaans news is run everyday; the PRAAG website is a web-based news service. On pay channels it is provided as second language on all sports, Kyknet&lt;/ref&gt; - than all the other official languages, except for English. More than 300 titles{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} in Afrikaans are published per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oulitnet.co.za/taaldebat/multilin.asp |title=Hannes van Zyl |publisher=Oulitnet.co.za |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through all the problems of depreciation and migration that Afrikaans faces today, the language still competes well, with Afrikaans [[DSTV]] channels (pay channels) and high newspaper and CD sales as well as popular internet sites. A resurgence in Afrikaans popular music (from the late 1990s) has added new momentum to the language especially among the younger generations in South Africa. The latest contribution to building the Afrikaans language is the availability of pre-school educational CDs and DVDs. These are also popular with large Afrikaans-speaking expatriate communities seeking to retain the language in family context. After years of inactivity, the Afrikaans language cinema is also starting to reactivate. With the 2007 film ''Ouma se slim kind'', the first full length Afrikaans movie since [[Paljas]] from 1998, a new era for Afrikaans cinema started. Several short-films have been created and more feature-length movies such as ''Poena is Koning'' and ''Bakgat'', both from 2008, have been produced.

Afrikaans also seems to be returning to the [[SABC]]. SABC3 stated in the beginning of 2009 that it will increase Afrikaans programming because of the needs of the &quot;growing Afrikaans-language market and their need for working capital as Afrikaans advertising is the only advertising that sells in the current South African television market&quot;. In April 2009, SABC3 started showing several Afrikaans-language programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenafrica.com/news/industry/997616.htm SABC3 “tests” Afrikaans programming], ''Screen Africa'', April 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Further latent support for the language is the de-politicised view of younger-generation South Africans: it is less and less viewed as &quot;the language of the oppressor&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

'''Aeolus''' &lt;ref&gt;Chaucer's ''Eolus'' ([http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/garland/deweever/E/eolus.htmde Weever, Jacqueline (1996).  ''Chaucer Name Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Eolus&quot;. (Garland Publishing)] Retrieved on 2009-10-06&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Αἴολος}} ''Aiolos'' {{IPA-el|ájjolos|}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: {{IPA-el|ˈe.olos||Ell-Aiolos.ogg}}) was the ruler of the winds in [[Greek mythology]]. In fact this name was shared by three mythic characters. These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which. [[Diodorus Siculus]] made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm&quot;&gt;{{Citation

All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous.

==Son of Hellen==
This Aeolus was son of [[Hellen]] and the [[nymph]] [[Orseis]], and a brother of [[Dorus]], [[Xuthus]] and, in some sources, of [[Amphictyon]] (who is otherwise a brother of Hellen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0158.html&lt;/ref&gt;). Described as the ruler of [[Aeolia]] (later called [[Thessaly]]) and held to be the founder of the [[Aeolic]] branch of the Greek nation, this Aeolus married [[Enarete]], daughter of Deimachus (otherwise unknown). Aeolus and Enarete had many children, although the precise number and identities of these children vary from author to author in the ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' i. 7. §3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholium on Pindar's ''Pythian Ode'' iv. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The great extent of country which this race occupied, and the desire of each part of it to trace its origin to some descend­ant of Aeolus, probably gave rise to the varying accounts about the number of his children. Some scholars contend that the most ancient and genuine story told of only four sons of Aeolus: [[Sisyphus]], [[Athamas]], [[Cretheus]], and [[Salmoneus]], as the representatives of the four main branches of the Aeolic race.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm&quot;/&gt; Other sons included [[Deioneus]], [[Perieres]], Cercaphas and perhaps [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]] (usually regarded as a brother of [[Makednos|Macedon]]) and [[Aethlius]]. Another son is named Mimas, who provides a link to the third Aeolus in a genealogy that seems very contrived. [[Calyce (mythology)|Calyce]], [[Peisidice]], Perimele and [[Alcyone]] were counted among the daughters of Aeolus and [[Enarete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.7.3 i. 7. ~ 3])&lt;/ref&gt; This Aeolus also had an illegitimate daughter named [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]], begotten on [[Melanippe]], daughter of the Centaur [[Cheiron]]. This Arne became the mother of the second Aeolus, by the god [[Poseidon]].

==Son of Poseidon==
[[Image:Yakovlev Eoles.jpg|145px|left|thumb|''Aeolus'' by [[Alexandre Jacovleff]] shows Aeolus as an embodiment of [[Wind]] himself.]]

This Aeolus was a son of Poseidon by [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]], daughter of Aeolus. He had a twin brother named [[Boeotus]]. Arne confessed to her father that she was with child by the god Poseidon; her father, however, did not believe her, and handed her over to a man named Metapontus, King of [[Icaria]]. When Bœotus and Æo­lus were born, they were raised by Meta­pontus; but their stepmother (Autolyte, wife of Metapontus) quarrelled with their mother Arne, prompting Bœotus and Aeolus to kill Autolyte and flee from Icaria. Bœotus (accompanied by Arne) went to southern Thessaly, and founded [[Boeotia]]; but Aeolus went to a group of islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, which received from him the name of the [[Aeolian Islands]]; accord­ing to some accounts this Aeolus founded the town of [[Lipara]]. Although his home has been traditionally identified as one of the Aeolian Islands (there is little consensus as to which), near [[Sicily]], an alternative location has been suggested at Gramvousa off the northwest coast of [[Crete]]. Aeolus had six sons and six daughters, whom in Homer he wed to one another and the family lived happily together. Later writers were shocked by the [[incest]]: in [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]],&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. ''Fabulae'', 238, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; the day Aeolus learned that one of his sons,  [[Macareus]], had committed incest with his sister [[Canace]] he expelled Macareus and threw the child born of this incestuous union to the dogs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Heroides]]'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and sent his daughter a sword by which she was to kill herself.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Parallel Lives'', p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Other late accounts claim that the child, a daughter named [[Amphissa]], was rescued and later beloved by [[Apollo]].

==Son of Hippotes==
This Aeolus is most frequently [[conflated]] with Aeolus, the son of [[Poseidon]] (God of the sea). It is difficult to [[delineate]] this Aeolus from the second Aeolus, as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers. The father of this third Aeolus is given as [[Mimas]], a son of the first Aeolus (son of Hellen). According to some accounts, Mimas married the same [[Melanippe]] who was the mother of [[Arne]]. This Aeolus lived on the floating island of [[Aeolia]] and was visited by [[Odysseus]] and his crew in the ''[[Odyssey]].'' He gave hospitality for a month and provided for a west wind to carry them home. He also provided a gift of a bag containing each of the four winds, which Odysseus's crew members unwittingly opened just before they were to reach Ithaca. Unfortunately, they were blown back to Aeolia, where Aeolus refused to provide any further help,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' x, 2&lt;/ref&gt; because he believed that their short and unsuccessful voyage meant that the Gods did not favour them. This Aeolus was perceived by post-Homeric authors as a god, rather than as a mortal and simple Keeper of the Winds (as in the ''Odyssey''). 

In the [[Aeneid]] by [[Virgil]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] offers Aeolus the [[nymph]] [[Deiopea]] as a wife if he will release his winds upon the fleet of [[Aeneas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{main|North Carolina v. Alford}}
[[File:North Carolina v. Alford.pdf|thumb|''[[North Carolina v. Alford]]'', [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (1970)]]
The Alford guilty plea originated in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case of ''[[North Carolina v. Alford]]'' (1970).&lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;champion&quot; /&gt; Henry Alford was [[indictment|indicted]] on a charge of [[first-degree murder]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; Evidence in the case included testimony from witnesses that Alford had said after the death of the victim that he had killed the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; Court testimony showed Alford and the victim had gotten into an argument at the house of the deceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; Alford left the house, and afterwards the victim received a fatal [[gunshot wound]] when he opened the door responding to a knock.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; 

Alford was faced with the possibility of [[capital punishment]] if convicted through a [[jury trial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;solgan&quot; /&gt; The [[death penalty]] was the automatic sentence by [[North Carolina]] law at the time, if two requisites in the case were satisfied.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; The defendant had to have pleaded not guilty, and the jury did not instead recommend a [[life sentence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; Had he pled guilty to first-degree murder, Alford would have had the possibility of a life sentence, but avoided the death penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; The defendant did not want to admit guilt, and instead gave a plea of ''[[nolo contendere]]'' while simultaneously saying that key points given by the prosecution were factual.&lt;ref name=&quot;champion&quot; /&gt; Alford pled guilty to [[second-degree murder]], and said he was doing so to avoid a death sentence if he had been convicted of first-degree murder after attempting to contest that charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;feinman&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Feinman  | first = Jay M.   | title =Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal System  | publisher =[[Oxford University Press, USA]]  | year =2006  | page =327  | isbn =0-19-517957-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alford was sentenced to thirty years in prison, after the trial judge in the case accepted the plea bargain and ruled that the defendant had been adequately apprised by his lawyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|left|[[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Byron White]] wrote the decision for the majority]]
Alford appealed and requested a new trial, arguing he was forced into a guilty plea because he was afraid of receiving a death sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; The [[Supreme Court of North Carolina]] ruled that the defendant had voluntarily entered the guilty plea, with knowledge of what that meant.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; Following this ruling, Alford petitioned for a [[writ of habeas corpus]] in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina]], and subsequently to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; In both cases, the courts relied on the initial state court ruling, and denied Alford's petition for a writ.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; Next, Alford petitioned again for a writ of habeas corpus in [[United States federal courts|United States federal court]], and this was again denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; &quot;I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't, they would gas me for it,&quot; wrote Alford in one of his appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;barksdale&quot; /&gt; The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that Alford's plea was not voluntary, because it was made under fear of the death penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;barksdale&quot; /&gt;

==Definition==
''Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms'' defines the term Alford plea as: &quot;A plea under which a defendant may choose to plead guilty, not because of an admission to the crime, but because the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to place a charge and to obtain conviction in court. The plea is commonly used in local and state courts in the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot; /&gt; According to ''[[University of Richmond Law Review]]'', &quot;When offering an Alford plea, a defendant asserts his innocence but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;judge&quot; /&gt; ''A Guide to Military Criminal Law'' notes that under the Alford plea, &quot;the defendant concedes that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict, but the defendant still refuses to admit guilt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;davidson&quot; /&gt; The book ''Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America'' published by [[Stanford University Press]] defines the plea as one in &quot;which the defendant adheres to her claim of innocence even while allowing that the government has enough evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fisher&quot; /&gt; According to the book ''Gender, Crime, and Punishment'' published by [[Yale University Press]], &quot;Under the Alford doctrine, a defendant does not admit guilt but admits that the state has sufficient evidence to find him or her guilty, should the case go to trial.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;daly&quot; /&gt; ''Webster's New World Law Dictionary'' defines Alford plea as: &quot;A guilty plea entered as part of a plea bargain by a criminal defendant who denies committing the crime or who does not actually admit his guilt. In federal courts, such plea may be accepted as long as there is evidence that the defendant is actually guilty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot; /&gt;

Defendants can take advantage of the ability to use the Alford guilty plea, by admitting there is enough evidence to convict them of a higher crime, while at the same time pleading guilty to a lesser charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;duff&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Duff  | first =Antony   | title =The Trial on Trial, Volume One: Truth and Due Process  | publisher =Hart Publishing  | year =2004  | page =58  | isbn =1-84113-442-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants usually enter an Alford guilty plea if they want to avoid a possible worse sentence were they to lose the case against them at trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot; /&gt; It affords defendants the ability to accept a [[plea bargain]], while maintaining innocence.&lt;ref name=&quot;marguis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Marquis  | first =Joshua  | title =Symposium: Innocnence in Capital Sentencing: Article: The Myth of Innocence  | journal =Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology  | volume =95  | page =501  | publisher =[[Northwestern School of Law]]  | date =Winter 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court and government usage==
This form of guilty plea has been frequently used in local and state courts in the United States;&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot; /&gt; though it consists of a small percentage of all plea bargains in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;fisher&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Fisher  | first =George  | title =Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America  | publisher =[[Stanford University Press]]  | year =2003  | page =319  | isbn =0-8047-5135-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of plea is not allowed in courts of the [[United States military]].&lt;ref name=&quot;davidson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Walburn  | first =Steve E.   | title =Should the Military Adopt an ''Alford''-Type Guilty Plea?  | journal =The Air Force Law Review  | volume =44  | pages =119–169  | publisher =[[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force|Judge Advocate General School, United States Air Force]] | year =1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the [[United States Department of Justice]] noted, &quot;In an Alford plea the defendant agrees to plead guilty because he or she
realizes that there is little chance to win acquittal because of the strong evidence of guilt.  About 17% of State inmates and 5% of Federal inmates submitted either an Alford plea or a no contest plea, regardless of the type of attorney.  This difference reflects the relative readiness of State courts, compared to Federal courts, to accept an alternative plea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Caroline Wolf | last=Harlow | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Defense Counsel in Criminal Cases | date=November 2000 | publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] | url =http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/dccc.txt | work =NCJ 179023 | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-03 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080716091432/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/dccc.txt |archivedate = 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1995 case ''State of Idaho v. Howry'' before the [[Idaho Court of Appeals]], the Court commented on the impact of the Alford guilty plea on later sentencing.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper&quot; /&gt; The Court ruled, &quot;Although an Alford plea allows a defendant to plead guilty amid assertions of innocence, it does not require a court to accept those assertions. The sentencing court may, of necessity, consider a broad range of information, including the evidence of the crime, the defendant's criminal history and the demeanor of the defendant, including the presence or absence of remorse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper&quot;&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Cooper  | first = Bob  | title = Coles Enters Guilty Pleas on Two Felony Charges  | work = Office of Attorney General Lawrence Wasden  | publisher = [[Idaho|State of Idaho]]  | date = November 3, 2003  | url =http://www2.state.id.us/ag/newsrel/2003/nr_nov032003b.htm  | accessdate = 2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1999 [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] case ''State v.

==Commentary==
In his 1972 book ''American Criminal Justice'', Jonathan D. Caplan comments on the Supreme Court decision, noting, &quot;The ''Alford'' decision recognizes the plea-bargaining system, acknowledging that a man may maintain his innocence but still plead guilty in order to minimize his potential loss.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Jackson  | first =Bruce  | title =Law and Disorder  | publisher =[[University of Illinois|University of Illinois Press]]  | year =1984  | pages =119–120  | isbn = 0-252-01012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caplan comments on the impact of the Supreme Court's decision making it necessary for there to be evidence of guilt in such a plea, &quot;By requiring that there be some evidence of guilt in such a situation, the decision attempts to protect the 'really' innocent from the temptations to which plea-bargaining and defense attorneys may subject them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson&quot; /&gt;

[[Major]] Steven E. Walburn argues in a 1998 article in ''The Air Force Law Review'' that this form of guilty plea should be adopted for usage by the United States military.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; &quot;In fairness to an accused, if, after consultation with his defense counsel, he knowingly and intelligently determines that his best interest is served by an Alford-type guilty plea, he should be free to choose this path. The system should not force him to lie under oath, nor to go to trial with no promise of the ultimate outcome concerning guilt or punishment. We must trust the accused to make such an important decision for himself. The military provides an accused facing court-martial with a qualified defense attorney. Together, they are in the best position to properly weigh the impact his decision, and the resulting conviction, will have upon himself and his family,&quot; writes Walburn.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt; He emphasizes that when allowing these pleas, &quot;trial counsel should establish as strong a factual basis as possible&quot;, in order to minimize the possible negative outcomes to &quot;the public's perception of the administration of justice within the military&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;walburn&quot; /&gt;

Stephanos Bibas writes in a 2003 analysis for ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'' that Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook]] and a majority of scholars &quot;praise these pleas as efficient, constitutional means of resolving cases.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bibas&quot; /&gt; Bibas notes that prominent plea bargain critic Albert Alschuler supports the use of this form of plea, writing, &quot;He views them as a lesser evil, a way to empower defendants within a flawed system. As long as we have plea bargaining, he maintains, innocent defendants should be free to use these pleas to enter advantageous plea bargains without lying. And guilty defendants who are in denial should be empowered to use these pleas instead of being forced to stand trial.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bibas&quot; /&gt; Bibas instead asserts that this form of plea is &quot;unwise and should be abolished&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibas&quot; /&gt; Bibas argues, &quot;These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by admissions of guilt in open court. They undermine the procedural values of accuracy and public confidence in accuracy and fairness, by convicting innocent defendants and creating the perception that innocent defendants are being pressured into pleading guilty. More basically, they allow guilty defendants to avoid accepting responsibility for their wrongs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bibas&quot; /&gt;

Legal scholar Jim Drennan, an expert on the court system at the Institute of Government at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], told the ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'' in a 2007 interview that the ability to use this form of guilty plea as an option in courts had a far-reaching effect throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;barksdale&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | last =Barksdale  | first =Titan   | title =(Not) Guilty - Lawyer in case that led to Alford plea says he worried about later questions   | work =[[Winston-Salem Journal]]  | page =B1  | date =March 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drennan commented, &quot;We have lots of laws, but human interaction creates unique circumstances and the law has to adapt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;barksdale&quot; /&gt; He said of the Supreme Court case, &quot;They had to make a decision about what to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Multiple issues|citations missing=January 2008|cleanup=February 2010}}
In [[analytic philosophy]], the term '''anti-realism''' is used to describe any position involving either the denial of an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[reality]] of [[entities]] of a certain type or the denial that verification-transcendent statements about a type of entity are either true or false. This latter [[wiktionary:construal|construal]] is sometimes expressed by saying &quot;there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not P.&quot; Thus, we may speak of anti-realism with respect to [[The problem of other minds|other minds]], the [[past]], the [[future]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the [[material world]], or even [[thought]]. The two construals are clearly distinct and often confused. For example, an &quot;anti-realist&quot; who denies that other minds exist (i. e., a [[solipsism|solipsist]]) is quite different from an &quot;anti-realist&quot; who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds (i. e., a logical [[behaviorist]]).{{Fact|date=January 2008|reason=ACTUALLY THIS PRESUMES THAT THERE ARE DECLARED SOLIPSISTS, *TO WHOM* DO THEY DECLARE THEMSELVES?}}

== Anti-realism in philosophy ==
=== Michael Dummett ===
The term was coined by [[Michael Dummett]], who introduced it in
his paper ''Realism'' to re-examine a number of classical philosophical
disputes involving such doctrines as [[nominalism]],
[[conceptual realism]], [[idealism]] and [[phenomenalism]]. The novelty of
Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as analogous to
the dispute between [[intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

According to intuitionists (anti-realists with respect to mathematical objects), the [[truth]] of a mathematical statement consists in our ability to prove it. According to platonists ([[philosophical realism|realists]]), the truth of a statement consists in its correspondence to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality. Thus, intuitionists are ready to accept a statement of the form &quot;P or Q&quot; as true only if we can prove P or if we can prove Q:
this is called the [[disjunction property]]. In particular, we cannot in general claim that &quot;P or not P&quot; is true (the [[law of Excluded Middle]]), since in some cases we may not be able to prove the statement &quot;P&quot; nor prove the statement &quot;not P&quot;. Similarly, intuitionists object to the [[existence property]] for classical logic, where one can prove &lt;math&gt;\exists x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, without being able to produce any term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of which &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds.

Dummett argues that the intuitionistic notion of truth lies at the
bottom of various classical forms of '''anti-realism'''. He uses this
notion to re-interpret [[phenomenalism]], claiming that it need not
take the form of a [[reductionism]] (often considered untenable).

Dummett's writings on anti-realism also draw heavily on the later writings of [[Wittgenstein]] concerning meaning and rule following.  In fact, Dummett's writings on anti-realism can be seen as an attempt to integrate central ideas from the [[Philosophical Investigations]] into [[analytical philosophy]].

Anti-realism in the sense that Dummett uses the term is also often called semantic anti-realism.

===Hilary Putnam's &quot;internal realism&quot;===
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Despite being at one time a defender of metaphysical realism, [[Hilary Putnam]] later abandoned this view in favor of a position he termed &quot;[[Hilary_Putnam#Metaphilosophy_and_ontology|internal realism]]&quot;.

===Precursors===
Doubts about the possibility of definite truth have been expressed since ancient times, for instance in the [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] of [[Pyrrho]]. Anti-realism about [[materialism|matter]] or [[physicalism|physical]] entities also has a long history. It can be found in the [[idealism]] of
[[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], as well as [[Hegel]] and other post-Kantians.  In fact, part of the appeal of semantic anti-realism (according to its advocates) is the promise it offers of making sense of [[Kant]]'s [[Transcendental Idealism]] without all the apparently incoherent rambling that seems to fill vast spans of the [[Critique of Pure Reason]].  The casual reader of any writings on semantic anti-realism might be forgiven for finding this a somewhat misleading claim.

===Anti-realist arguments===
Idealists are skeptics about the physical world, maintaining either: 1) that nothing exists outside the mind, or 2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist; the latter case often takes the form of a denial of the idea that we can have unconceptualised experiences (see [[Myth of the Given]]).  Conversely, most realists (specifically, [[Indirect realism|indirect realists]]) hold that perceptions or [[sense data]] are caused by mind-independent objects. But
this introduces the possibility of another kind of skepticism: since our understanding of [[causality]] is that the same effect can be produced by multiple causes, there is a [[indeterminacy|lack of determinacy]] about what one is really perceiving. A concrete example of a situation where an individual's sensory input might be caused by something other than what he thinks is causing it is the [[brain in a vat]] scenario.

On a more abstract level, [[model theory|model theoretic]] arguments hold that a given set of [[symbol]]s in a [[theory]] can be mapped onto any number of sets of real-world objects &amp;mdash; each set being a &quot;model&quot; of the theory &amp;mdash; providing the interrelationships between the objects are the same. (Compare with [[symbol grounding]]).

== Anti-realism in science ==
In [[philosophy of science]], anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of &quot;unobservable&quot; [[entity|entities]] such as [[electron]]s or [[DNA]], which are not detectable with human senses. For a brief discussion comparing such anti-realism to its opposite, realism, see (Okasha 2002, ch. 4). Ian Hacking (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;84) also uses the same definition. One prominent position in the philosophy of science is [[instrumentalism]], which is a [[non-realism]] position. Non-realism takes a purely agnostic view towards the existence of unobservable entities: unobservable entity X serves simply as an instrument to aid in the success of theory Y. We need not determine the existence or non-existence of X. Some scientific anti-realists argue further, however, and deny that unobservables exist even as non-truth conditioned instruments.

==Anti-realism in mathematics==
Realism in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is the claim that mathematical entities such as number have a mind-independent existence. The main forms are [[philosophy of mathematics#empiricism|empiricism]], which associates numbers with concrete physical objects; and [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]], according to which numbers are [[abstract]], non-physical entities. 

The &quot;[[epistemic]] argument&quot; against Platonism has been made by [[Paul Benacerraf]] and [[Hartry Field]]. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are ''[[abstract object|abstract]]'' entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot
interact [[causal]]ly with concrete, physical entities.  (“the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time” &lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, 1989, Realism, Mathematics, and Modality, Oxford: Blackwell, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;) Whilst our knowledge of concrete, physical objects is based on our ability to [[perception|perceive]] them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Since abstract objects are outside the nexus of causes and effects, and thus perceptually inaccessible, they cannot be known through their effects on us&quot; Katz, J. ''Realistic Rationalism'', p15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;,[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue81/ Philosophy Now: ''Mathematical_Knowledge_A_Dilemma Mathematical Knowledge: A dilemma'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/#EpiAcc Standord Encyclopeida of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;An account of mathematical truth ..must be consistent with the possibility of mathematical knowledge&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benacceraf, 1973, p409&lt;/ref&gt;). Another way of making the point is that if the Platonic world were to disappear, it would make no difference to the ability of mathematicians to generate [[mathematical proof|proof]]s, etc., which is already fully accountable in terms of physical processes in their brains.

Field developed his views into [[Philosophy of mathematics#fictionalism|fictionalism]]. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of [[mathematical structuralism]], according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

The argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory [[naturalism|naturalistic]] account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by [[Sir Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheEmperorsNewMind Review of [[The Emperor's New Mind]] ]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by [[Jerrold Katz]] in his book ''[[Realistic Rationalism]]''.

A more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world, i.e. the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]. In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

== Anti-realism in art ==

In discussions of [[art]] (including [[Visual arts and design|visual art]], writing, [[music]], and [[lyrics]]), ''anti-realism'' and ''anti-realist'' may be used in one of the philosophical senses described above, or may simply be used in contrast to [[realism (arts)|realism]], in whatever sense the latter is meant. Thus [[surrealism]] in visual art is an &quot;anti-realist&quot; tendency, and the [[psychedelic]] bands common in the United States in the 1960s were &quot;anti-realist,&quot; &amp;c.  (There are also bands and singers that express anti-realist sentiments, again in whatever sense this is understood, in their lyrics.) These terms may not be as precise when applied to art as when applied to philosophical matters. ''Anti-reality'' is occasionally used in this sense, although it may be used in other senses.

'''Arsenal Football Club ''' is a professional [[Premier League|English Premier League]] [[association football|football]] club based in [[North London]]. One of the [[Football records in England#Most successful clubs overall (1871 – present)|most successful clubs]] in English football, they have won 13 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and Premier League titles and 10 [[FA Cup]]s. They hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the English top flight and are the only side to have completed a Premier League season [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]].

Arsenal was founded in 1886 in [[Woolwich]] and in 1893 became the first club from the south of England to join [[the Football League]]. In 1913, they moved north across the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]]. In the 1930s they won five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they won the [[the Double|League and FA Cup Double]], in the [[1970-71 in English football|1970–71 season]], and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century won two more Doubles and reached the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]].

Arsenal have a long-standing rivalry with neighbours [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with whom they regularly contest the [[North London derby]]. Arsenal are also the third most valuable Association football club in the world as of 2010, valued at $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes10&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club became the first southern member of [[the Football League]] in 1893, starting out in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by businessmen [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] and William Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soar &amp; Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], North London; they dropped &quot;Woolwich&quot; from their name the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soar &amp; Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal only finished in fifth place in 1919, but were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], by reportedly dubious means.&lt;ref&gt;It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by Norris, who was chairman of the club at the time; see [[History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966)]] for more details. These allegations range from political machinations to outright bribery; no firm proof of any wrongdoing has ever been found.

Arsenal appointed [[Herbert Chapman]] as manager in 1925. Having already won the league twice with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in 1923–24 and 1924–25 (see [[Football in England#Seasons in English football|Seasons in English football]]), Chapman brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Soar &amp; Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies&amp;nbsp;– victory in the [[1930 FA Cup Final]] preceded two League Championships, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. In addition, Chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local [[London Underground]] station from &quot;Gillespie Road&quot; to &quot;[[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]]&quot;, making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3709.aspx | title=London Underground and Arsenal present The Final Salute to Highbury | publisher=Transport for London | date=12 January 2006 | accessdate=11 August 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in early 1934, leaving [[Joe Shaw (footballer born 1883)|Joe Shaw]] and [[George Allison]] to carry on his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles, in 1933–34, 1934–35 and 1937–38, and the [[1936 FA Cup Final|1936 FA Cup]]. As key players retired, Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, and then the intervention of the Second World War meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the war, Arsenal enjoyed a second period of success under Allison's successor [[Tom Whittaker (footballer)|Tom Whittaker]], winning the league in 1947–48 and 1952–53, and the FA Cup in 1950. Their fortunes waned thereafter; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the 1930s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.&lt;ref name=FCHD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club [[physiotherapist]] [[Bertie Mee]] as manager in 1966. After losing two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] finals, they won their first European trophy, the [[1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first League and FA Cup [[the Double|double]] in [[1970-71 in English football|1970–71]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Arsenal finished as First Division runners-up in 1972–73, lost three FA Cup finals, in 1972, 1978 and 1980, and lost the [[1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1980 Cup Winners' Cup final]] on [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]]. The club's only success during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]], widely regarded as a classic.&lt;ref name=FCHD&gt;{{cite web

The return of former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in 1986–87, Graham's first season in charge. This was followed by a League title win in 1988–89, won with a last-minute goal in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|final game of the season]] against fellow title challengers [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Graham's Arsenal won another title in 1990–91, losing only one match, won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993, and a second European trophy, the [[Cup Winners' Cup]], in 1994.&lt;ref name=FCHD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The club's success in the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century owed a great deal to the 1996 appointment of [[Arsène Wenger]] as manager. Wenger brought new tactics, a new training regime and several foreign players who complemented the existing English talent. Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02. In addition, the club reached the final of the [[1999–2000 UEFA Cup]] (losing on penalties to [[Galatasaray S.K.

==Crest==

[[Image:Arsenal crest 1888.png|thumb|left|Arsenal's first crest from 1888|alt=A line drawing of three cannon, viewed from above, on a shield, surrounded by a scroll and decorative foliage]]
Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first crest featured three [[cannon]]s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]]. These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.&lt;ref 
name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt; In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in [[blackletter]], and above the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly-adopted Latin [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit''  &quot;victory comes from harmony&quot;, coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt; For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green.

Below the cannon, but still within the shield, is a depiction of a smaller coat of arms. Below the shield is a scroll with the words &quot;Victoria Concordia Crescit&quot; on it.]]
Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a [[trademark]], and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold &quot;unofficial&quot; Arsenal merchandise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a [[sans-serif]] typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Arsenal Crest 1930.svg|thumb|left|150px|The 'mongram' badge as used in the [[1930 FA Cup Final]]]]
Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a [[monogram]] of the club's initials in red on a white background.&lt;ref name=&quot;shirt badge&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The monogram theme was developed into an [[Art Deco]]-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;artdeco&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;soartyler23&quot;/&gt; The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and blue socks.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot;&gt;{{cite web |

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played golf.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;&gt;{{cite web |

His shorts bear the number 32.]]Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot; /&gt; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt; In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot; /&gt;

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt; in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, [[S.C. Braga|Sporting Clube de Braga]]'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of ''Os Arsenalistas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. Since the 1969–70 season, they have worn yellow and blue, but there have been exceptions. They wore a green and navy away kit in 1982–83, and since the early 1990s and the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away colours have been changed regularly. During this period the designs have been either two-tone blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, and the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

Like those of most other major football clubs, Arsenal's shirts have featured sponsors' logos since the 1980s; sponsors include [[JVC]] (1982–1999), [[Sega]] (1999–2002), [[Telefónica Europe|O2]] (2002–2006), and [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] (from 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt;

==Stadiums==
[[Image:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|left|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium.  The seats are predominantly red.]]
For most of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], apart from a three-year period at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]] between 1890 and 1893. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, until the club installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]] for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/DownloadableDocuments/Environment/Pdf/highburyconservationplan_2005.pdf |

    month=February |year=2005 |
    accessdate=11 August 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;/&gt;

Highbury could hold over 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an [[all-seater stadium]] in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity had to be reduced further during [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches to accommodate additional advertising hoardings, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which could house more than 70,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138932.stm | title=Arsenal get Wembley go-ahead | publisher=BBC Sport | date=24 July 1998 | accessdate=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]] and the other three stands were close to residential properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;/&gt; These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,355-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since renamed the [[Emirates Stadium]], about 500&amp;nbsp;metres south-west of Highbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as &quot;Gooners&quot;, the name derived from the team's nickname, &quot;The Gunners&quot;. The fanbase is large and generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/prematt.htm?comp=1 | title=Attendances 2007/08 | author=Kempster, Tony | accessdate=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2006, the fourth-highest all-time average attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Highbury High'', ''Gunflash'' and the less cerebral ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, supporters sing &quot;One-Nil to the Arsenal&quot; (to the tune of &quot;[[Go West (song)|Go West]]&quot;) and &quot;Boring, Boring Arsenal&quot;, which used to be a common taunt from opposition fans but is now sung ironically by Arsenal supporters when the team is playing well.&lt;ref name=&quot;noble&quot;&gt;{{cite news |

There have always been Arsenal supporters outside of London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography.

As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, ''[[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery]]'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film centres on a [[friendly match]] between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager [[George Allison]] was given a speaking part.&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;/&gt; More recently, the book ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular.

The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's [[offside trap]], in an attempt to co-ordinate their [[striptease]] routine.&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;&gt;{{cite web |

[[File:Barbecue DSCF0013.JPG|thumb|Grilling is one of America's favorite styles of cooking.]]
{{US culture}}
'''American cuisine''' is a style of food preparation originating from the [[United States of America]]. [[European colonization of the Americas]] yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well in to the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.

==History==
Fruits included [[strawberry|strawberries]] which Europeans named the Virginia strawberry due to being larger than the European dwarf mountain strawberry, as well as [[huckleberry|huckleberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[Ribes|currant]]s, [[gooseberry|gooseberries]], [[plum]]s, [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[sumac]] berries, [[juniper berries]], [[hackberries]], [[elderberries]], [[Crataegus|hawthorne]] fruit, [[pitaya]], white [[evening primrose]] fruit, Nuts proliferated. Animals included [[rabbit]], [[raccoon]], [[Virginia Opossum]], [[squirrel]], [[wood rat]], [[chipmunk]], [[ground hog]], [[Collared Peccary|peccary]], [[prairie dog]], [[skunk]], [[American Badger|badger]], [[American Beaver|beaver]], and [[North American Porcupine|porcupine]]. Game birds included [[Wild Turkey|turkey]], [[partridge]], [[quail]], [[pigeon]], [[plover]], [[lark]] and [[osprey]]. Water fowl was quite abundant and varied, particularly on the coasts such as [[duck]]s, [[geese]], [[swan]]s, [[Crane (bird)|crane]] and [[sea crane]]. Other aqueous proteins included alligators and frogs, from which the legs were enjoyed, especially [[bullfrog]]s. Snail meat was also enjoyed, along with various turtles such as the [[painted turtle]], [[wood turtle]], and [[Chelydridae|snapping turtle]] along with their eggs. In addition the [[sea turtle]] and [[green turtle]], endangered today were considered an important spiritual protein by the American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seafood===
[[Image:Blue crab on market in Piraeus - Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 20020819-317.jpg|thumb|[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue crab]] was cooked by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on the east coast of America.]]
Saltwater fish eaten by the American Indians were [[cod]], [[lemon sole]], [[flounder]], [[herring]], [[halibut]], [[sturgeon]], [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[drum (fish)|drum]] on the East Coast, and [[olachen]] and salmon on the West Coast. Whale was hunted by American Indians off the Northwest coast, especially by the [[Makah people|Makah]], and used for their meat and oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nae/docs/makahfaq.html A Fact Sheet Issued by the Makah Whaling Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; Seal and walrus were also utilized. Eel from New York's [[Finger Lakes]] region were eaten. [[Catfish]] seemed to be favored by tribes, including the [[Modoc]]s. Crustacean included [[shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[crayfish]], and [[dungeness crab]]s in the Northwest and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s in the East. Other shellfish include [[abalone]] and [[geoduck]] on the [[California]] coast, while on the East Coast the [[surf clam]], [[quahog]], and the [[soft-shell clam]]. [[Oyster]]s were eaten on both shores, as were [[mussel]]s and [[Common periwinkle|periwinkle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=21,22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cooking methods====
Native Americans utilize a number of cooking methods. [[Grilling]] meats was common. [[Spit roast]]ing over a pit fire was common as well. Vegetables, especially [[root vegetable]]s were often cooked directly in the ashes of the fire. As early American Indians lacked the proper pottery that could be used directly over a fire, they developed a technique which has caused many [[anthropologist]]s to call them &quot;[[Stone Boilers]]&quot;. The American Indians would heat rocks directly in a fire and then add the bricks to a pot filled with water until it came to a boil so that it would cook the meat or vegetables in the boiling water. Another method was to use an empty [[bison]] stomach filled with desired ingredients and suspended over a low fire. The fire would have been insufficient to completely cook the food contained in the stomach however, as the flesh would burn so heated rocks would be added to the food as well. Some American Indians would also use the leather of a bison hide in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Indians are credited as the first in America to create fire-proof pottery to place in direct flame. In what is now the Southwestern United States, American Indians also created ovens made of [[adobe]] called [[horno]]s in which to bake items such as breads made from [[cornmeal]]. American Indians in other parts of America made ovens out of dug pits. These pits were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers and then seaweed or corn husks (or other coverings) placed on top to steam fish and shellfish as well as vegetables; potatoes would be added while still in-skin and corn while in-husk, this would later be referred to as a [[New England clam bake|clambake]] by the colonists. The hole was also a location for producing what has become [[baked beans|Boston baked beans]] made from beans, [[maple sugar]] and a piece of bear fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=31,32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies}}
[[Image:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|thumb|upright|left|Map of the 13 American Colonies in 1775.]]

When the [[colonist]]s came to America, their initial attempts at survival included planting [[crop]]s familiar to them from back home in England. In the same way, they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion. Through hardships and eventual establishment of trade with Britain, the [[West Indies]] and other regions, the colonists were able to establish themselves in the American colonies with a cuisine similar to their previous [[British cuisine]]. There were some exceptions to the diet, such as local vegetation and animals, but the colonists attempted to use these items in the same fashion as they had their equivalents or ignore them if they could. The manner of cooking for the American colonists followed along the line of British cookery up until the Revolution. The British sentiment followed in the cookbooks brought to the New World as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a general disdain for [[French cuisine|French]] cookery, even with the French [[Huguenot]]s in [[South Carolina]] and French-Canadians. One of the cookbooks that proliferated in the colonies was [[The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy]] written by [[Hannah Glasse]], wrote of disdain for the French style of cookery, stating “the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook!” Of the French recipes, she does add to the text she speaks out flagrantly against the dishes as she “… think it an odd jumble of trash.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Glasse|1750}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcing the anti-French sentiment was the [[French and Indian War]] from 1754-1764. This created a large anxiety against the French, which influenced the English to either deport many of the French, or as in the case of the [[Acadian]]s, they migrated to [[Louisiana]]. The Acadian French did create a large French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana, but had little or no influence outside of Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=512, Vol. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common ingredients====
The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which you lived. Local cuisine patterns had established by the mid 18th century. The [[New England]] colonies were extremely similar in their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from England. A striking difference for the colonists in New England compared to other regions was seasonality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Oliver|2005|pp=16–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the southern colonies, they could farm almost year round, in the northern colonies, the growing seasons were very restricted. In addition, colonists’ close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their diet, especially in the northern colonies. [[Wheat]], however, the grain used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow, and imports of wheat were far from cost productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Substitutes in cases such as this included cornmeal. The [[Johnnycake]] was a poor substitute to some for wheaten bread, but acceptance by both the northern and southern colonies seems evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Oliver|2005|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As many of the New Englanders were originally from England game hunting was often a pastime from back home that paid off when they immigrated to the [[New World]]. Much of the northern colonists depended upon the ability either of themselves to hunt, or for others from which they could purchase game. This was the preferred method for protein consumption over animal husbandry, as it required much more work to defend the kept animals against American Indians or the French.

=====Livestock and game=====
Commonly hunted and eaten game included deer, bear, buffalo and wild turkey. The larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant sauce, while the other smaller portions went into [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s, [[sausage]]s, [[pie]]s, and pasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=546–547, Vol. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to game, colonists' protein intake was supplemented by [[mutton]]. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[Florida]] originally introduced [[sheep]] to the New World, but this development never quite reached the North, and there they were introduced by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and English. The keeping of sheep was a result of the English non-practice of [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=26, Vol. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The animals provided wool when young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=176–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forage-based diet for sheep that prevailed in the Colonies produced a characteristically strong, gamy flavor and a tougher consistency, which required aging and slow cooking to tenderize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=R.W. |last=Apple Jr. |title=Much Ado About Mutton, but Not in These Parts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/dining/29mutt.html |work= [[New York Times]] |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |quote=Until it fell from favor after World War II, it was a favorite of most Britons, who prized mutton (defined there as the meat from sheep at least 2 years old) above lamb (from younger animals) for its texture and flavor. It has a bolder taste, a deeper color and a chewier consistency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fats and oils=====
A number of [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s made from animals served to cook much of the colonial foods. Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear oil for cooking, while solidified bear fat resembled [[shortening]]. Rendered [[pork]] fat made the most popular cooking medium, especially from the cooking of [[bacon]]. Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the South. The colonists enjoyed [[butter]] in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the [[American Revolution]], as [[cattle]] were not yet plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=458–459, Vol. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Seafood=====
[[Image:Lobster NSRW.jpg|thumb|upright|The American [[lobster]] was a staple of the colonial diet]]
Those living near the New England shore often dined on fish, crustaceans, and other animals that originated in the waters. Colonists ate large quantities of turtle, and it was an exportable delicacy for Europe. Cod, in both fresh and salted form was enjoyed, with the salted variation created for long storage. The highest quality cod was usually dried, however, and exported to the [[Mediterranean]] in exchange for fruits not available in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=82–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were extremely common in the New England diet.

=====Alcoholic drinks=====
Prior to the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], New Englanders consumed large quantities of [[rum]] and [[beer]], as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items: Rum was the distilled spirit of choice, as the main ingredient, [[molasses]], was readily available from trade with the West Indies. Further into the interior, however, one would often find colonists consuming [[whiskey]], as they did not have similar access to [[sugar cane]]. They did have ready access to corn and rye, which they used to produce their whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, until the Revolution, many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for human consumption, as many believed that it caused the poor to become raucous and unkempt drunkards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Crowgey|1971|pp=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet one item, [[hops]], important for the production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. Hops only grew wild in the Old World, and as such, importation from England and elsewhere became essential to beer production. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, imports were seen on merchant shelves, including [[wine]] and [[brandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Southern variations=====
In comparison to the northern colonies, the southern colonies were quite diverse in their agricultural diet. Unlike the colonies to the north, the southern colonies did not have a central region of culture. The uplands and the lowlands made up the two main parts of the southern colonies. The slaves and poor of the south often ate a similar diet, which consisted of many of the indigenous New World crops. Salted or smoked pork often supplement the vegetable diet. Rural poor often ate [[squirrel]], [[Opossum|possum]], [[rabbit]] and other woodland animals. Those on the “rice coast” often ate ample amounts of [[rice]], while the grain for the rest of the southern poor and slaves was [[cornmeal]] used in [[bread]]s and [[porridge]]s. Wheat was not an option for most of those that lived in the southern colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=34–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diet of the uplands often included [[cabbage]], [[string bean]]s, white [[potato]]es, while most avoided [[sweet potato]]es and [[peanut]]s. Non-poor whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because of the perceived inferiority of crops of the African slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits as part of their [[breakfast]], along with healthy portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it was used in the preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=47–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowlands, which included much of the Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, included a varied diet heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, rather than just the French. As such, rice played a large part of the diet as it played a large part of the diets of the Africans and Caribbean. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=48–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, although the English had an inherent disdain for French foodways, as well as many of the native foodstuff of the colonies, the French had no such disdain for the indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they had a vast appreciation for the native ingredients and dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=149, Vol. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century&amp;ndash;21st century===
Some corporate kitchens (for example, [[General Mills]], [[Campbell's]], [[Kraft Foods]]) develop consumer recipes. One characteristic of American cooking is the [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles. Asian cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asian-nation.org/asian-food.shtml Asian Cuisine &amp; Foods]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, while some dishes considered typically American many have their origins in other countries, American cooks and chefs have substantially altered them over the years, to the degree that the dishes now enjoyed the world over are considered to be American. [[Hot dog]]s and hamburgers are both based on traditional [[German Cuisine|German]] dishes, brought over to America by German immigrants to the United States, but in their modern popular form they can be reasonably considered American dishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art10695.asp Hamburgers &amp; Hot Dogs - All-American Food]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies in the American [[food industry]] develop new products requiring minimal preparation, such as frozen entrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/business/13conagra.html ConAgra’s Chief Is Moving to Revitalizny's products]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these recipes have become very popular. For example, the General Mills ''Betty Crocker's Cookbook'', first published in 1950 and currently in its 10th edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Crocker|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly found in American homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20071003/ai_n21022934 Face value: Fictional Betty Crocker gives big business a human touch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional cuisine==
:''Main article [[List of American regional and fusion cuisines]]
Given the United States' large size it has numerous regional variations. The United States' regional cuisine is characterized by its extreme diversity and style with each region having its own distinctive cuisine.

===New England===
:''Main article [[Cuisine of New England]]''
[[Image:Quail 07 bg 041506.jpg|thumb|New England [[clam chowder]]]]
New England is a northeastern region of the United States, including the six states of [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] cuisine became part of the cookery style that the early colonists brought with them. The style of New England cookery originated from its colonial roots, that is to say practical, frugal and willing to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=181–182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such dishes as [[succotash]], [[chowder]], [[baked beans]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobster is an integral ingredient to the cuisine, indigenous to the shores of the region. Other [[shellfish]] of the coastal regions include [[little neck clam]]s, [[Scallop|sea scallop]]s, [[blue mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Soft-shell clam|soft shell clam]]s and [[Atlantic jackknife clam|razor shell clam]]s. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the [[New England clam bake|clambake]]. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|pp=12–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruits of the region include the ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' grapes used in [[grape juice]] made by companies such as [[Welch's]], along with [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], [[Kosher wine]] by companies like [[Mogen David]] and [[Manischewitz]] along with other wineries that make higher quality wines. [[Apple]]s from New England include the original varieties, Baldwin, Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise, Porter, Roxbury Russet, Wright, Sops of Wine, Peck's Pleasant, Titus Pippin, Westfield-Seek-No-Further, and Duchess of Oldenburg. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] are another fruit indigenous to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|pp=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midwest===
:''Main article [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States]]''
Midwestern cuisine covers everything from [[barbeque]] to the [[Chicago-style hot dog]].

===The American South===
:''Main article [[Cuisine of the Southern United States]]''
[[Grits]] and [[gumbo]] are an integral part of the southern cuisine

===Cuisine in the West===
:''Main article [[Cuisine of the Western United States]]''
Cooking in the American West consists of the [[fast food]] [[hamburger]] and the [[San Francisco burrito]].

===American Southwestern Cuisine===
:''Main article [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States]]''
Southwestern food draws influences from Mexican cooking including [[tex-mex]] and the [[burrito]].

*{{Main|List of American regional and fusion cuisines}}

==Ethnic and immigrant influence==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2008}}

The demand for ethnic foods in the United States reflects the nation's changing diversity as well as its development over time. According to the [[National Restaurant Association]], &lt;blockquote&gt;
Restaurant industry sales are expected to reach a record high of $476 billion in 2005, an increase of 4.9 percent over 2004... Driven by consumer demand, the ethnic food market reached record sales in 2002, and has emerged as the fastest growing category in the food and beverage product sector, according to USBX Advisory Services. Minorities in the U.S. spend a combined $142 billion on food and by 2010, America's ethnic population is expected to grow by 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Oralia|2005}} (par. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A movement began during the 1980s among popular leading chefs to reclaim America's ethnic foods within its regional traditions, where these trends originated. One of the earliest was [[Paul Prudhomme]], who in 1984 began the introduction of his influential cookbook, ''Paul Prodhomme's Louisiana Kitchen'', by describing the over 200 year history of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and Cajun cooking; he aims to &quot;preserve and expand the Louisiana tradition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Prodhomme|1984}} n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Prodhomme's success quickly inspired other chefs. Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his ''Feast of Sunlight'' cookbook in 1988. The movement finally gained fame around the world when California became swept up in the movement, then seemingly started to lead the trend itself, in, for example, the popular restaurant [[Chez Panisse]] in Berkeley. Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon, chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine, were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and Wolfgang Puck, both former colleagues at the restaurant. Puck went on to describe his belief in contemporary, new style American cuisine in the introduction to ''The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another major breakthrough, whose originators were once thought to be crazy, is the mixing of ethnic cuisines. It is not at all uncommon to find raw fish listed next to tortillas on the same menu. Ethnic crossovers also occur when distinct elements meet in a single recipe. This country is, after all, a huge melting pot. Why should its cooking not illustrate the American transformation of diversity into unity?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Puck|1986}} n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Puck's former colleague, Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with [[California Cuisine]] and the overall American [[culinary revolution]]. Meanwhile, the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a distinguished establishment, popularizing its so called &quot;mantra&quot; in its book by [[Paul Bertolli]] and owner [[Alice Waters]], ''Chez Panisse Cooking'', in 1988. Published well after the restaurants' founding in 1971, this new cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy that had developed over the years. The book embraced America's natural bounty, specifically that of California, while containing recipes that reflected Bertoli and Waters' appreciation of both northern Italian and French style foods.

===Early ethnic influences===
While the earliest cuisine of the United States was primarily influenced by [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], the [[Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies|cuisine of the thirteen colonies]] or the culture of the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] [[American South]]; the overall culture of the nation, its [[gastronomy]] and the growing [[culinary arts]] became ever more influenced by its changing [[ethnic]] mix and [[immigrant]] patterns over the 20th century unto the present. Some of the ethnic groups that continued to influence the cuisine were here in prior years; while others arrived more numerously during “The Great [[Transatlantic Migration]] (of 1870&amp;ndash;1914) or other [[mass migrations]].

Some of the ethnic influences could be found in the nation from after the [[American Civil War]] and into the [[History of United States continental expansion]] during most of the 19th century. Ethnic influences already in the nation at that time would include the following groups and their respective cuisines:
*[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] [[American Indians in the United States]] (Indians) and [[Native American cuisine|American Indian cuisine]]
*Select nationalities of Europe and the respective developments from [[early modern European cuisine]] of the colonial age:
**[[British-Americans]] and on-going developments in [[New England cuisine]], the national traditions founded in cuisine of the thirteen colonies and some aspects of other regional cuisine.
**[[Spanish Americans]] and early modern [[Spanish cuisine]], as well as [[Basque-Americans]] and [[Basque cuisine]].
**Early [[German-American]] or [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine]]
**[[French Americans]] and their &quot;[[New World]]&quot; regional identities such as:
***[[Acadian]]
***[[Cajun]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]
*The various ethnicities originating from early social factors of [[Race in the United States]] and the [[gastronomy]] and [[cuisine]]s of the “[[New World]],” [[Latin American cuisine]] and North American cuisine:
**[[African-Americans]] and “[[Soul food]].”
**[[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]. Louisiana Creole (also called French Créole) refers to native born people of various racial descent who are descended from the Colonial French and/or Spanish settlers of Colonial French Louisiana, before it became part of the United States in 1803 with the [[Louisiana Purchase]].
** [[Cuisine of Puerto Rico]]
**[[Mexican-Americans]] and Mexican-American cuisine; as well as related regional cuisines:
***[[Tex-Mex]] (regional Texas and Mexican fusion)
***Cal-Mex (regional California and Mexican fusion)
***Some aspects of “[[Southwestern cuisine]].”
** [[New Mexican cuisine|Cuisine of New Mexico]]

===Later ethnic and immigrant influence===
{{Main|Immigration to the United States}}

Mass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several waves. Historians identify several waves of migration to the United States: one from 1815-1860, in which some five million [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Scandinavians|Scandinavian]], and others from [[northwestern Europe]] came to the United States; one from 1865-1890, in which some 10 million immigrants, also mainly from northwestern Europe, settled, and a third from 1890-1914, in which 15 million immigrants, mainly from [[Central Europe|central]], [[Eastern Europe|eastern]], and [[southern Europe]] (many [[Austrian people|Austrian]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Jewish people|Jewish]], [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Italian people|Italian]], and [[Romanian people|Romanian]]) settled in the United States. [http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture08.html]

Together with earlier arrivals to the United States (including the indigenous American Indians, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], particularly in the [[Western United States|West]], [[Southwest]], and [[Texas]]; [[African American]]s who came to the United States in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]; and early colonial migrants from Britain, France, Germany, and elsewhere, these new waves of immigrants had a pro profound impact on national or regional cuisine. Some of these more prominent groups include the following:

*[[Polynesia]]n Americans - [[Hawaiian cuisine]]
*[[West Indian American]]s - [[Caribbean cuisine]], [[Jamaican cuisine]]
*[[Cuban American]]s - [[Cuban cuisine]]
*[[Chinese American]]s - [[American Chinese cuisine]]
*[[Irish American]]s - [[Irish cuisine]]
*[[Italian American]]s - [[Italian-American cuisine]]
*[[German American]]s - [[German cuisine]] (the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], although descended from Germans, arrived early than the bulk of German migrants and have distinct culinary traditions)
*[[Indian American]]s - [[Indian cuisine]]
*[[Greek American]]s - [[Greek cuisine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine]]
*[[Japanese American]]s - [[Japanese cuisine]] and influences on the [[Hawaiian cuisine]]
*[[American Jews]] - [[Jewish cuisine]]
*[[Portuguese American]]s - [[Portuguese cuisine]]
*[[Polish American]]s - [[Polish cuisine]], with particular impact on [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States|Midwest]]
*[[Russian American]]s - [[Russian cuisine]], with particular impact on [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States|Midwest]]
*[[Lithuanian American]]s - [[Lithuanian cuisine]], with particular impact on [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States|Midwest]]
*[[Vietnamese American]]s - [[Vietnamese cuisine]]
*[[Arab American]]s, particularly [[Lebanese American]]s (the largest ethnic Arab group in the United States) - [[Arab cuisine]], [[Lebanese cuisine]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) cuisines have indeed joined the mainstream. These three cuisines have become so ingrained in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate. According to the study, more than nine out of 10 consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods, and about half report eating them frequently. The research also indicates that Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) have become so adapted to such an extent that &quot;authenticity&quot; is no longer a concern to customers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hensley, Sue, ''National Restaurant Association.''  Article/ News Release, &quot;International Cuisine Reaches America's Main Street,&quot; 10 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contributions from these ethnic foods have become as common as traditional &quot;American&quot; fares such as hot dogs, hamburgers, beef [[steak]] ([[chicken-fried steak]], for example, is a variation on German [[schnitzel]]), cherry pie, [[Coca-Cola]], milkshakes, fried chicken and so on. Nowadays, Americans also have a ubiquitous consumption of foods like [[pizza]] and [[pasta]], [[tacos]] and [[burritos]] to &quot;[[General Tso's chicken]]&quot; and [[fortune cookies]]. Fascination with these and other ethnic foods may also vary with region.

==Notable American chefs==
American [[chef]]s have been influential both in the food industry and in popular culture. An important 19th Century American chef was [[Charles Ranhofer]] of [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]]. American cooking has been exported around the world, both through the global expansion of restaurant chains such as [[T.G.I. Friday's]] and [[McDonald's]] and the efforts of individual restaurateurs such as Bob Payton, credited with bringing American-style pizza to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Payton, 50, Restaurateur, Dies. New York Times July 16, 1994, Obituary, p 28.[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10611FF355B0C758DDDAE0894DC494D81]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of television chefs such as [[Robert Carrier (chef)|Robert Carrier]] and [[Julia Child]] tended to concentrate on cooking based primarily on European, especially French and Italian, cuisines. Only during the 1970s and 80s did television chefs such as [[James Beard]] and [[Jeff Smith (TV personality)|Jeff Smith]] shift the focus towards home-grown cooking styles, particularly those of the different ethnic groups within the nation. Notable American restaurant chefs include [[Thomas Keller]], [[Charlie Trotter]], [[Grant Achatz]], [[Alfred Portale]], [[Paul Prudhomme]], [[Paul Bertolli]], [[Alice Waters]], and [[celebrity chef]]s like [[Mario Batali]], [[Alton Brown]], [[Emeril Lagasse]], [[Cat Cora]], [[Michael Symon]], [[Bobby Flay]], [[Ina Garten]], [[Todd English]], and [[Paula Deen]].

'''Ahmad Shah Massoud''' (احمد شاه مسعود- ''Aḥmad Šāh Mas'ūd''; September 2, 1953 &amp;ndash; September 9, 2001) was a [[Kabul University]] engineering student turned military leader who played a leading role in driving the [[Red Army|Soviet army]] out of [[Afghanistan]], earning him the name '''Lion of Panjshir'''. His followers call him '''Āmir Sāhib-e Shahīd''' (''Our Beloved Martyred Commander''). A devout [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] reportedly also always carrying a book of [[Sufi]] mystic [[Ghazali]] with him, he strongly rejected the interpretations of Islam followed by the [[Taliban]], [[Al Qaeda]] or the Saudi establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = | title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310  | publisher =  Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His followers not only saw him as a military commander but also as a spiritual leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;

Following the withdrawal of [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet troops from Afghanistan]] the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' named Massoud &quot;the Afghan who won the Cold War&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;/&gt; After the collapse of the communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Soviet-backed government]] of [[Mohammad Najibullah]] in 1992, Massoud became the [[Afghan Ministry of Defense|Minister of Defense]] under the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. Following the rise of the [[Taliban]] in 1996, Massoud returned to the role of an armed opposition leader, serving as the military commander and political leader of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] (also known in the West as ''Northern Alliance'').

On September 9, 2001, two days before the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, Massoud was assassinated in [[Takhar Province]] of Afghanistan by two suspected Arab [[al-Qaeda]] [[suicide bomber]]s posing as journalists. The following year, he was named &quot;National Hero&quot; by the order of Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]. The date of his death, September 9, is observed as a national holiday known as &quot;Massoud Day&quot; in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/afghanistan/events Afghanistan Events], Lonely Planet Travel Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  The year following his assassination, in 2002, Massoud was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==Early life==
The son of police commander Dost Mohammad, an ethnic [[Tajik people|Tajik]], Ahmad Shah Massoud was born on September 2, 1953 in [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]], [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], Afghanistan. At the age of five, he started grammar school in Bazarak and stayed there until second grade. Since his father was promoted to be police chief of [[Herat]], he attended 3rd and 4th grade at the Mowaffaq School in Herat. He also received a religious education at the &quot;Masjed-e Jame&quot; [[mosque]] in Herat. Later, his father was moved to [[Kabul]] where he attended the [[Lycée Esteqlal]] and obtained his [[Baccalauréat|Baccalaureate]]. Since his childhood, he was considered exceedingly talented; from 10th grade on, his school acknowledged him as a particularly gifted student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=Ghost Wars|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He knew many languages including [[Persian language|Persian]], Pashtu, Urdu, Hindi and French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/extraits/lecteur.php?id=86&amp;encod=9&amp;part=vr&amp;titre=Afghanistan+%3A+de+l%27ind%E9pendance+%E0+la+chute+des+talibans Accueil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a good working knowledge of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MaS&quot;/&gt;

While studying in Kabul in 1972, Massoud became involved with the [[Muslim Youth|Sazman-i Jawanan-i Musulman]] (&quot;organization of Muslim youth&quot;), the student branch of the [[Jamiat-i Islami]] (&quot;Islamic Society&quot;), whose chairman was professor [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. This Islamist organization opposed the rising [[communist]] and Soviet influence that became especially evident after the [[coup d'état]] that brought [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] to power in 1973: the coup was orchestrated by the [[Parcham]] faction of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]], the Afghan communist party.

In 1976, the movement split between supporters of Rabbani, who led the Jamiat, and the extremist elements surrounding [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], who then founded the [[Hezb-i Islami]]. Massoud who had regular and vehement disputes with Hekmatyar joined Rabbani's faction.

==The Soviet invasion and PDPA communism==
===Communist revolution in Afghanistan (1978)===
{{Main|Saur Revolution}}
The government of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] increasingly distanced itself from the Afghan communists and the Soviet Union. In 1978, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA, حزب دیموکراتیک خلق افغانستان) orchestrated a bloody coup assassinating [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], his family and bodyguards and consequently assuming power. The PDPA soon started reforms along [[Marxist-Leninist]] and Soviet lines. The reforms and the PDPA's affinity to the Soviet Union were met with heavy resistance among the population and also the Afghan [[islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]], especially as the government attempted to enforce its Marxist policies by arresting or simply executing those who resisted. Human Rights Watch estimates that as many as 100,000 people may have been killed in the countryside alone by government troops. The repression plunged large parts of the country, especially the rural areas, into open revolt against the new Marxist government. By spring 1979 unrests had reached 24 out of 28 Afghan provinces including major urban areas. Over half of the Afghan army would either desert or join the insurrection. 

Having ascertained that an uprising against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] would be backed by the people, Massoud made his way to the Panjshir and started an insurrection on July 6, 1979. The fight lasted 40 days, during which the whole Panjshir, Salang, and Bola Ghain were in open revolt against the Marxist government. After these 40 days, Massoud's leg was severely injured and the troops under his command had no more weapons and ammunition. In the end the government troops defeated them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afgha.com/?q=node/974 &quot;Biography: Ahmad Shah Massoud&quot;], http://www.afgha.com/, August 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing lessons from this failure, Massoud decided to avoid conventional confrontation with larger and better armed government troops and to instead wage a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Isby | title = War in a distant country, Afghanistan: invasion and resistance | year = 1989 | publisher = Arms and Armour Press |isbn= 0 85368 769 2| page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance against the Soviet Union (1979-1989)===
{{Main|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.jpg|thumb|290px|Major resistance forces against the Soviets 1985; Army-green depicts locations of Jamiat-i Islami. [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Massoud's alliance) comprised many Jamiat positions but also those of other groups.]]
{{rquote|right|Widely seen as a guerrilla genius - his country's [[Che Guevara]], with charisma and beard to match - Massoud successfully played [[David]] to the Soviets' [[Goliath]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0103/life.html Sebastian Junger Under Fire] by Ted Chamberlain, ''[[National Geographic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the 1979 invasion and occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet troops, Massoud devised a strategic plan for expelling the invaders and overthrowing the communist regime. The first task was to establish a resistance force which had the hearts and minds of the people. The second phase was one of &quot;active defense&quot; of the Panjshir stronghold, while carrying out asymmetric warfare. The third phase, the &quot;strategic offensive&quot;, would see Massoud's forces taking control of large parts of Northern Afghanistan. The fourth phase was the &quot;general application&quot; of Massoud's principles to the whole country, and the final demise of the Afghan communist government.

From the start of the war, Massoud's mujahideen proved to be a thorn in the side for the occupying Soviet forces by ambushing Soviet and Afghan communist convoys travelling through the [[Salang Pass]], resulting in fuel shortages in Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iyer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first2= Pico |last2= Iyer |last1 = van Voorst |first1 = Bruce | last3= Aftab | first3 = Mohammad

The Soviets mounted a [[Panjshir offensives|series of offensives]] against the Panjshir. Between 1980 and 1985, these offensives were conducted twice a year. Yet, despite engaging more men and hardware on each occasion, the Soviets were unable to defeat Massoud's forces. In 1982, the Soviets began deploying major combat units in the Panjshir numbering up to 30,000 men. Massoud pulled his troops back into subsidiary valleys, where they occupied fortified positions. When the Soviet columns advanced onto these positions, they fell into ambushes. When the Soviets withdrew, they handed over their positions to Afghan army garrisons, and Massoud and his mujahideen forces attacked and recaptured them one by one.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Soviets offered Massoud a temporary truce, which he accepted in order to rebuild his own forces and give the civilian population a break from Soviet attacks. He put the respite to good use. In this time he created the [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Supervisory Council) which subsequently united 130 commanders from 12 Afghan provinces in their fight against the Soviet army. This council existed outside the fold of the Peshawar parties that were prone to internecine rivalry and bickering, and served to smooth out differences between resistance groups, due to political and ethnic divisions. It was the predecessor of what could have become a unified Islamic Afghan army.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Michael (2002). ''Massoud, de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p. 216. Paris: Audibert. {{Language icon|fr}} ISBN 2-84749-002-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations with the party headquarters in [[Peshawar]] were often strained, as Rabbani insisted on giving Massoud no more weapons and supplies than to other Jamiat commanders, even those who did little fighting. To compensate for this deficiency, Massoud relied on revenues drawn from exports of [[emerald]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowersox, Gary; Snee, Lawrence; Foord, Eugene; Seal, Robert |first=|url=http://www.gems-afghan.com/articles/page26a.jpg|title=''Emeralds of the Panjshir valley, Afghanistan'' |year=1991|publisher=  www.gems-afghan.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lapis lazuli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commission-refugies.fr/IMG/pdf/Afghanistan-les_seigneurs_de_guerre.pdf|title=''Le pouvoir des seigneurs de guerre et la situation sécuritaire en Afghanistan''| language=French|publisher=  [http://www.commission-refugies.fr/ Commission des Recours des Réfugiés]|accessdate=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are traditionally exploited in Northern Afghanistan.

To organize support for the mujahideen, Massoud established an administrative system that enforced law and order (nazm) in areas under his control. The Panjshir was divided into 22 bases (qarargah) governed by a military commander and a civilian administrator, and each had a judge, a prosecutor and a [[public defender]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, L. Will; Shariat, Abdullah (2004). ''Fighting Masoud's war'', Melbourne: Lothian, p. 200. ISBN 0-7344-0590-1&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud's policies were implemented by different committees: an economic committee was charged with funding the war effort. The health committee provided health services, assisted by volunteers from foreign [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as [[Aide médicale internationale]]. An education committee was charged with the training of the military and administrative [[cadre]]. A culture  committee and a judiciary committee were also created.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

This expansion prompted [[Babrak Karmal]] to demand that the Red Army resume their offensives, in order to crush the Panjshir groups definitively. However, Massoud had received advance warning of the attack through his intelligence agents in the government and he evacuated all 130,000 inhabitants from the valley into the Hindukush mountains, leaving the Soviet bombings to fall on empty ground and the Soviet battalions once again to face the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.201.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the defeat of the Soviet-Afghan attacks, Massoud was able to carry out the next phase of his strategic plan, expanding the resistance movement and liberating the northern provinces of Afghanistan. In August 1986, he captured [[Farkhar]] in [[Takhar Province]]. In November 1986, his forces overran the headquarters of the government's 20th division at Nahrin in [[Baghlan Province]], scoring an important victory for the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion was also carried out through diplomatic means, as more mujahideen commanders were persuaded to adopt the Panjshir military system.

Despite almost constant attacks by the Red Army and the Afghan army, Massoud was able to increase his military strength. Starting in 1980 with a force of less than 1,000 ill-equipped guerillas, the Panjshir valley mujahideen grew to a 5,000-strong force by 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iyer&quot; /&gt; After expanding his influence outside the valley, Massoud increased his resistance forces to 13,000 fighters by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Isby, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces were divided into different types of units: the locals (mahalli) were tasked with static defense of villages and fortified positions. The best of the mahalli were formed into units called grup-i zarbati (shock troops), semi-mobile groups that acted as [[Military reserve|reserve]] forces for the defense of several strongholds. A different type of unit was the mobile group (grup-i-mutaharek), a lightly equipped [[commando]]-like formation numbering 33 men, whose mission was to carry out [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] attacks outside the Panjshir, sometimes as far as 100&amp;nbsp;km from their base. These men were professional soldiers, well-paid and trained, and, from 1983 on, they provided an effective strike force against government outposts. Uniquely among the mujahideen, these groups wore uniforms, and their use of the [[pakul]] made this headwear emblematic of the Afghan resistance.

Massoud's military organization was an effective compromise between the traditional Afghan method of warfare and the modern principles of guerilla warfare that Massoud had learned from the works of [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Che Guevara]]. His forces were considered the most effective of all the various Afghan resistance movements.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States provided Massoud with close to no support. Part of the reason was that it permitted its funding and arms distribution to be administered by Pakistan, which favored rival mujahideen leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In an interview Massoud expressed: &quot;We thought the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] knew everything. But they didn't. They supported some bad people [meaning Hekmatyar].&quot; Primary advocates for supporting Massoud instead were State Department's Edmund McWilliams and Peter Tomsen, who were on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Others included two [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analysts, [[Michael Johns (executive)|Michael Johns]] and James A. Phillips, both of whom championed Massoud as the Afghan resistance leader most worthy of U.S. support under the [[Reagan Doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, James A. (May 18, 1992).

[http://michaeljohnsonfreedomandprosperity.blogspot.com/2008/01/charlie-wilsons-war-was-really-americas.html &quot;Charlie Wilson's War Was Really America's War&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the Soviet army and the Afghan communist army were mainly defeated by Massoud and his mujahideen in numerous small engagements between 1984 and 1988. In 1989, after labeling the Soviet Union's military engagement in Afghanistan &quot;a bleeding wound&quot;, Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began a withdrawal of Soviet troops from the nation. On February 15, 1989, in what was depicted as an improbable victory for the mujahideen, the last Soviet soldier left the nation.

===Fall of the Afghan communist regime (1992)===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989-1992)}}

After the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|departure of Soviet troops]] in 1989, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] regime, then headed by [[Mohammad Najibullah]], proved unexpectedly capable of holding its own against the mujahideen. Backed by a massive influx of weapons from the Soviet Union, the Afghan armed forces reached a level of performance they had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage and were able to maintain control over all of Afghanistan's major cities.

By 1992, however, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the regime began to crumble. Food and fuel shortages undermined the capacities of the government's army, and a resurgence of factionalism split the regime between [[Khalq]] and [[Parcham]] supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0120) ''The Fall of Kabul, April 1992''], [[Library of Congress]] country studies. Retrieved April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after it was clear that Najibullah had lost control of the nation, his army commanders and governors arranged to turn over authority to resistance commanders and local notables throughout the country. Joint councils (shuras) were immediately established for local government in which civil and military officials of the former government were usually included. In many cases, prior arrangements for transferring regional and local authority had been made between foes.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot; /&gt;

Collusions between military leaders quickly brought down the Kabul government. In mid-January 1992, within three weeks of the demise of the Soviet Union, Massoud was aware of conflict within the government's northern command. General Abdul Momim, in charge of the [[Hairatan]] border crossing at the northern end of Kabul's supply highway, and other non-[[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] generals based in [[Mazari Sharif]] feared removal by Najibullah and replacement by Pashtun officers. The generals rebelled and the situation was taken over by [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], who held [[General Officer|general rank]] as head of the [[Jowzjan]]i militia, also based in Mazari Sharif. He and Massoud reached a political agreement, together with another major militia leader, Sayyed Mansour, of the [[Ismaili]] community based in Baghlan Province. These northern allies consolidated their position in Mazar-i-Sharif on March 21. Their coalition covered nine provinces in the north and northeast. As turmoil developed within the government in Kabul, there was no government force standing between the northern allies and the major [[Bagram Air Base|air force base at Bagram]], some seventy kilometers north of Kabul. By mid-April 1992, the Afghan air force command at Bagram had capitulated to Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot; /&gt; On March 18, 1992, Najibullah announced his willingness to resign, and on April 17, as his government fell apart, he tried to escape but was stopped at [[Kabul Airport]] by Dostum's forces. He then took refuge at the United Nations mission, where he remained unharmed until 1995. A group of Parchami generals and officials declared themselves an interim government for the purpose of handing over power to Massoud, who at that time was the dominant military force and popular among the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot; /&gt;

Massoud transferred power to create an interim government to the political parties in order to give nobody a reason to continue the war. He kept his forces outside of Kabul trying to convince other commanders especially [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to do the same in order to avoid bloodshed. In early 1992, in a recorded conversation, Massoud tried to convince [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] not to attack Kabul but instead to join the peace talks. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVMdc_2R6LY see video] Massoud was awaiting a political accord. In April 1992 the political leaders finally agreed on a plan for peace: the Peshawar Accords.

The Peshawar Accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period. Ahmad Shah Massoud was appointed as the [[minister of defense]]. 
{{quote|&quot;The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government. ...

Massoud enjoyed strong support inside Afghanistan but the Islamic State in general, although internationally recognized, received close to no outside funding or support. The United States and European countries after the communist defeat largely lost interest in Afghanistan and disengaged.

With the strong support of Pakistan, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar - although he was repeatedly offered the position of prime minister - placed Kabul under intensive rocket bombardment in May 1992.

Ahmad Shah Massoud did not order any crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt; The Afghanistan Justice Project which is frequently used by Human Rights Watch as source concludes: 
{{quote|&quot;[T]here is no indication that senior [[Shura-e Nazar]] leaders [including Massoud] ordered abuses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt;|Afghanistan Justice Project|}}
In those cases where crimes were committed by individuals fighting inside his troops, reports point out the responsibility of corrupted sub-commanders or individuals who used the chaos for their own purposes. John Jennings, a journalist from the [[Associated Press]] (AP) and [[The Economist]], who was on the ground in Kabul from 1992 to 1994 and was considered as a reliable source by [[Human Rights Watch]], concluded: 
{{quote|&quot;He [Massoud] can hardly be blamed for the presence of irresponsible armed groups in the capital, having done everything within his power to prevent it. Until November 1994, I witnessed firsthand the resulting dilemmas he faced, the amazing restraint with which he met them, and the almost willfully feckless manner in which absentee Western &quot;observers&quot; based in Pakistan distorted the situation in accord with ISI [Pakistan intelligence service] propaganda. ... Any popular movement, if it is truly popular, is going to harbor a criminal element, just because any large population harbors a criminal element. It is unrealistic to expect zero crimes. Yet Afghans, even Massoud's enemies, know that abuses by his troops were rare and punished as often as they were caught. ... His enemies on the other hand undertook mass murder, looting, and ethnic cleansing as a matter of policy. ... Had Massoud not fought to hold on to Kabul, the human rights situation in Afghanistan and throughout the region would have been vastly worse than it was.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;|John Jennings|Associated Press}}
Edward Girardet, director of the Global Journalism Network in Geneva, explained: 
{{quote|&quot;When Massoud operated in the north during the fight against the Soviets, and towards the end of the Taliban period, his Northern Front commanders he watched quite closely and controlled well, but in Kabul, no. ... He could not control all of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;|Edward Girardet|Global Journalism Network Geneva}}
In contrast to the time of chaos in Kabul, Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for troops under the direct control of Massoud from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001. But from 1992 to 1995, due to the sudden initiation of the wars and the decentralized power structures, working government departments, a police or a system of justice and accountability for the newly-created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. An Afghan observer described the situation during that time: 
{{quote|&quot;Massoud was always talking to his people about not behaving badly; he told them that they were accountable to their God. But because of the rocket attacks on the city the number of troops had to be increased, so there were ten or twelve thousand troops from other sources that came in ... He [Massoud] not only did not order any [crimes], but he was deeply distressed by them. I remember once ... Massoud commented that some commanders were behaving badly, and said that he was trying to bring them to justice ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;|Eng. Mohammad Eshaq|in &quot;Massoud&quot; (Webster University Press 2009)}}
Farid Amin reports the following exemplary incident: 
{{quote|&quot;One day he [Massoud] was going from Kabul to Shamali, and he saw a trailer truck and somehow got suspicious. He stopped it, and when they opened the back there were goods in it, things that belonged to other people, probably taken from houses or government offices. He accused them: &quot;You are thieves, you are trying to steal.&quot; Then he saw his own picture in the back of their truck - you know that people tried to use Massoud's name and picture to gain power or to take advantage of things - and he said, &quot;First remove that picture of your leader, the leader of thieves.&quot; In his way he was telling them, listen if you say I am your leader and you do these things, that is what you make me - a leader of thieves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;|Farid Amin|in &quot;Massoud&quot; (Webster University Press 2009)}}
Meanwhile there were also reports that individuals loyal to Massoud were helping civilians caught in crossfire or warning civilians of impeding attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt; 

In 1993 Massoud created the Cooperative Mohammad Ghazali Culture Foundation (&quot;Bonyad-e Farhangi wa Ta'wani Mohammad-e Ghazali&quot;) to further humanitarian assistance and politically-independent Afghan culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/yest/asmasood.html Afghanistan Online: Biography Ahmad Shah Massoud]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghazali Foundation provided free medical services during some days of the week to residents of Kabul who were unable to pay for medical treatment themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; The Ghazali Foundation's department for distribution of auxiliary goods was the first partner of the Red Cross. The Ghazali Foundation's department of family consultation was a free advisory board, which was accessible seven days a week for the indigent. Although Massoud was responsible for the financing of the foundation, he did not interfere into its cultural work. A council led the foundation and a jury consisting of impartial university lecturers decided on the works of artists. The Ghazali foundation enabled Afghan artists to exhibit their works at different places in Kabul and numerous artists and authors were honoured for their works; some of them neither proponents of Massoud nor the Islamic State government. 

Meanwhile, southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1994, the [[Taliban]] (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp.25–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mullah Omar]] started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of Kandahar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt; When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;/&gt; In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

In late 1994, most of the militia factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's [[Secretary of Defense]] Ahmad Shah Massoud. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;&gt;Amnesty International. &quot;DOCUMENT - AFGHANISTAN: FURTHER INFORMATION ON FEAR FOR SAFETY AND NEW CONCERN: DELIBERATE AND ARBITRARY KILLINGS: CIVILIANS IN KABUL.&quot; 16 November 1995 Accessed at: http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA11/015/1995/en/6d874caa-eb2a-11dd-92ac-295bdf97101f/asa110151995en.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International Committee of the Red Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1995|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jly2.htm |title =Afghanistan: escalation of indiscriminate shelling in Kabul| publisher =International Committee of the Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic State government took steps to restore law and order. Courts started to work again also convicting individuals inside government troops who had committed crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Jnia-TUuCDs|title=BBC Newsnight 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide [[political process]] with the goal of national [[Democratic consolidation|consolidation]] and [[democratic]] elections. A conference in three parts was arranged by Massoud. He united political and cultural personalities, governors, commanders, clergymen and representatives, in order to reach a lasting agreement. Massoud, like most people in Afghanistan, saw this conference as a small hope for democracy and for free elections. His favourite for candidacy to the presidency was Dr. [[Mohammad Yusuf]], the first democratic prime minister under [[Zahir Shah]], the former king. In the first meeting representatives from 15 different Afghan provinces met, in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating. Up until then the Islamic State's reach had been limited. Massoud was now trying to put a consolidation process into action to unite Afghanistan. He also invited the [[Taliban]] to join the process wanting them to be a partner in providing stability to Afghanistan during such a process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Massoud unarmed went to talk to some Taliban leaders in Maidan Shar. But the Taliban declined to join a process leading towards democratic elections. When Massoud returned to Kabul unharmed, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life: he was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to assassinate Massoud while the possibility had presented itself.

Neighboring Pakistan exerted strong influence over the Taliban. A publication with the George Washington University describes: &quot;Initially, the Pakistanis supported ... Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ... When Hekmatyar failed to deliver for Pakistan, the administration began to support a new movement of religious students known as the Taliban.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Security Archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2003|url =http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/ |title =The September 11th Sourcebooks Volume VII: The Taliban File| publisher = gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts like [[Amin Saikal]] describe the Taliban as developing into a [[proxy war|proxy]] force for Pakistan's regional interests which the Taliban decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;/&gt; ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzPcMB9SQz0 see video]) [[Amnesty International]], referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report:

On September 26, 1996, as the Taliban with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]].

Ahmad Shah Massoud created the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the areas under the control of Massoud and against those under the control of other regional leaders. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI see video]) The United Front included forces and leaders from different political backgrounds as well as from all ethnicities of Afghanistan including [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] or [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]]. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled territory in which roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population was living in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghōr Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]]. 

Massoud did not intend for the United Front to become the ruling government of Afghanistan. His vision was for the United Front to help establish a new government, where the various ethnic groups would share power and live in peace through a democratic form of government. Massoud told Roger L. Plunk, [[George Washington University]] author of the ''Wandering Peacemaker'' and international mediator, that his dream was of &quot;an Afghanistan at peace with itself, and of the Panjshir Valley, which had been stripped of many of its trees, being once again full of flowering almond trees and laughing children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; 

Meanwhile, the Taliban imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their political and judicial interpretation of Islam issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physicians for Human Rights&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1998 |url = http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/documents/reports/talibans-war-on-women.pdf |title = The Taliban's War on Women.

In 1998, Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only main leader of the United Front in Afghanistan and the only leader who was able to defend vast parts of his area against the Taliban. Most major leaders including the Islamic State's President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], and others were living in exile. The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview: 

{{quote|&quot;The Taliban say: 'Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us', and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But for what price?! The difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state. We can not accept their conditions of compromise, or else we would have to give up the principles of modern democracy. We are fundamentally against the system called 'the Emirate of Afghanistan'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.orient.uw.edu.pl/balcerowicz/texts/Ahmad_Shah_Masood_en.htm |title =The Last Interview with Ahmad Shah Massoud | publisher = Piotr Balcerowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Ahmad Shah Massoud|2001}}

Massoud wanted to convince the Taliban to join a [[political process]] leading towards democratic elections in a foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Proposal for Peace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1998|url =ttp://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm |title =Proposal for Peace, promoted by Commander Massoud | publisher = peace-initiatives.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposals for peace can be seen here: [http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm Proposal for Peace, promoted by Commander Massoud]. He also stated:
{{quote|&quot;The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced from the people now [in 2001]. They are weaker than in the past.

American journalist Sebastian Junger who frequently travels to war zones stated in March 2001:

In early 2001 Ahmad Shah Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] asking the [[international community]] to provide [[humanitarian]] help to the people of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw see video] He stated that the Taliban and [[Al Qaeda]] had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]&quot; and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;/&gt; On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The areas of Massoud'''

Life in the areas under direct control of Massoud was different from the life in the areas under Taliban or i. e. Dostum's control. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI see video]) In contrast to the time of chaos in which all structures had collapsed in Kabul, Massoud was able to control his troops very well during the period starting in late 1996. Human Rights Watch notes no human rights crimes for Massoud's troops in the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001. [[File:Massoud 2000.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Massoud conferring with advisers in August 2000]]Massoud always controlled the [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], [[Takhar]], parts of [[Parwan]] and [[Badakhshan]] during the war. Some other provinces (notably [[Kunduz]], [[Baghlan]], [[Nuristan]] and the north of [[Kabul]]) were captured by his forces from the Taliban and lost again from time to time as the frontlines varied. 

Massoud created democratic institutions which were structured into several committees: political, health, education and economic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Still, many people came to him personally when they had a dispute or problem and asked him to solve their problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; 

Massoud also signed the Women's Rights Declaration. In the area of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa by law. They were allowed to work and to go to school. Although it was a time of war, girl schools were operating in some districts. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage in favour of the women to make their own choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; To Massoud there was reportedly nothing worse than treating a person like an object.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; 

{{rquote|left|It is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the Almighty. Both have equal rights. Women can pursue an education, women can pursue a career, and women can play a role in society -- just like men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;}}
While it was Massoud's stated personal conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion that could only be achieved through education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Author Pepe Escobar wrote in ''Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'':
{{quote|&quot;Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that 'the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression.' His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women -- they would have the same rights as men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;|Pepe Escobar| in 'Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'}} 

Humayun Tandar, who took part as a Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that &quot;strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask the Jewish [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Professor Michael Barry or his Christian friend Jean-José Puig: &quot;Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;

'''International relations'''

U.S. policy regarding Massoud, the Taliban and Afghanistan remains ambiguous and differed between the various U.S. government agencies.

In 1997, U.S. State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. She obtained a clear answer with Massoud stating that as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat he would continue to defend it from the Taliban. 
Robin Raphel eventually became a lobbyist and adviser at Cassidy &amp; Associates.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Law Journal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2010|url =http://www.law.com/jsp/law/international/LawArticleIntl.jsp?id=1202439488447 |title = Despite Obama Ban, Official's Lobbyist Past No Obstacle| publisher = [[The National Law Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm had a $1.2 million contract with the Musharraf military regime of Pakistan. At Cassidy &amp; Associates she lobbied and advised Congress and the State Department for Pakistan on issues such as Afghan policy, Pakistan's relations with India, judicial independence and U.S. perceptions and congressional views of the Pakistan government.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Law Journal&quot;/&gt; In late 2009 Raphel was (again) appointed to the Af-Pak region as deputy to [[Richard Holbrooke]], the US. Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, by the Obama administration. Raphel will be the main person overlooking the $1.5 billion U.S. aid package &quot;for non-military purpose&quot; to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Law Journal&quot;/&gt; 

At one point in the war, in 1997, the Taliban were vulnerable and the road to the capital, Kabul, was wide open. Two top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to convince - without success - the United Front not to take advantage of a opportunity to make crucial gains against the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2004 |url =http://rohrabacher.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=17093|title =9/11 Represented a Dramatic Failure of Policy and People | publisher = U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the United Front could strike, Assistant Secretary of State Rick Indefurth and American U.N. Ambassador [[Bill Richardson]] flew to northern Afghanistan and tried to convince the leadership of the United Front that this was not the time for an offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; Instead, they insisted this was the time for a cease-fire and an arms embargo. At the same time Pakistanis began a &quot;Berlin-like airlift to resupply and re-equip the Taliban&quot;, financed with Saudi money.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; 

On another note an analyst with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), Julie Sirrs, had visited Afghanistan, but only in those areas controlled by the Taliban. After returning, she had realized that this was a one-dimensional view of Afghanistan and there were gaping holes in the DOD's understanding of the situation. In 1998, she requested to officially go back to northern Afghanistan to the areas controlled by Commander Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; Subsequently she was denied the permission to go there.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; So she went to the Panjshir Valley on her vacation and paid the journey on herself (in 1998). U.S. congressman Dana Rohrabacher describes: 
{{quote|&quot;When she got to the Panjshir Valley, she found... something vital to America's security was happening, something she was not really able to discover when she visited the Taliban-controlled areas before. Commander Massoud told her that he was facing a new enemy in Afghanistan [meaning foreign esp. Arab forces].... Apparently, bin Laden, who was making Afghanistan into his base of operations, was importing Islamic radicals from all over the world, training them as terrorists and killers and then sending them up against Massoud's troops.... She only had a short time, but she collected enough information for a preliminary report, and she headed home. The minute she got back, she found herself under severe restrictions at the Defense Intelligence Agency and restricted to whom she could brief or show any of her reports.... The commanding officer of the DIA labeled her as insubordinate, he fired her; and when she fought her dismissal, he set out to destroy her. Amidst the fight to save her job, the DIA commanding officer told her what really upset him most was her contact with Massoud, who, according to the DIA general, was one of the bad guys. This general was sending his people to be briefed by the Taliban, but any contact with Massoud was a cause for dismissal.... It was a mind set of the man who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency. Something is terribly wrong with this picture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt;|U.S. Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]]|to U.S. Congress in 2004}} 

In the meantime, the only collaboration between Massoud and another U.S. intelligence service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), consisted of an effort to trace [[Osama bin Laden]] following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;&gt;Risen, James. &quot;State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration&quot;, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.

A change of policy, lobbied for by CIA officers on the ground who had visited the area of Massoud, regarding support to Massoud was underway in the course of 2001. According to Steve Coll's book &quot;Ghost Wars&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt;  (who won the 2005 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Non-Fiction):

{{quote|&quot;The CIA officers admired Massoud greatly. They saw him as a [[Che Guevara]] figure, a great actor on history's stage. Massoud was a poet, a military genius, a religious man, and a leader of enormous courage who defied death and accepted its inevitability, they thought.... In his house there were thousands of books: Persian poetry, histories of the Afghan war in multiple languages, biographies of other military and guerilla leaders. In their meetings Massoud wove sophisticated, measured references to Afghan history and global politics into his arguments. He was quiet, forceful, reserved, and full of dignity, but also light in spirit. The CIA team had gone into the Panshjir as unabashed admirers of Massoud. Now their convictions deepened....&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt; |[[Steve Coll]]|in &quot;Ghost Wars&quot;}} 

U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher also recalls: &quot;[B]etween Bush's inauguration and 9/11, I met with the new national security staff on 3 occasions, including one meeting with Condoleezza Rice to discuss Afghanistan. There were, in fact, signs noted in an overview story in The Washington Post about a month ago that some steps were being made to break away from the previous administration's Afghan policy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counterterrorist Center, began to draft a formal, legal presidential finding for Bush's signature authorizing a new covert action program in Afghanistan, the first in a decade that sought to influence the course of the Afghan war in favour of Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt;  This change in policy was finalized in August 2001 when it was too late.

After Pakistan had funded, directed and supported the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, Massoud and the United Front received some assistance from India.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pigott: [http://books.google.com/books?id=XaQPHbHb_fkC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Mohammad+Najibullah+delhi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P99ziKKf3-&amp;sig=9msSFGE-gWwa8jtpVoHSC9g-_A4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qsMZStLsHpeWMZKphJoP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 Canada in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt; India was particularly concerned about Pakistan's Taliban strategy and the Islamic militancy in its neighborhood; It provided US$70 million in aid including two [[Mi-17]] helicopters, three additional helicopters in 2000 and US$8 million worth of high-altitude equipment in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Mcleod: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EqDdfZwSc3EC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=india+hijacking+ahmed+shah+massoud&amp;client=firefox-a India and Pakistan ]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the alliance supposedly also received minor aid from [[Tajikistan]], Russia and [[Iran]] because of their opposition to the Taliban and the Pakistani control over the Taliban's Emirate. Their support, however, remained limited to the most needed things. Meanwhile Pakistan engaged up to 28 000 Pakistani nationals and regular Pakistani army troops to fight alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces against Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History Commons&quot;/&gt; 

In April 2001, the president of the European Parliament [[Nicole Fontaine]] (who called Massoud the &quot;pole of liberty in Afghanistan&quot;) invited Massoud with the support of French and Belgian politicians to address the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]], Belgium. In his speech, he asked for humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan. Massoud further went on to warn that his intelligence agents had gained limited knowledge about a huge-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil being imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [http://www.cooperativeresearch.org History Commons]|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a040601massoudspeech#a040601massoudspeech |title=''April 6, 2001: Rebel Leader Warns Europe and US About Large-Scale Imminent Al-Qaeda Attacks''|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== September 9, 2001 (death) ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Taliban]] --&gt;
[[File:The body of Ahmad Shah Massoud.JPG|thumb|Massoud's tomb in [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]] in the [[Panjshir Valley]].]]
Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of a [[suicide attack]] at Khwaja Bahauddin, in [[Takhar Province]] in northeastern Afghanistan on September 9, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html &quot;Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/world/threats-responses-assassination-afghans-too-mark-day-disaster-hero-was-lost.html &quot;THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASSASSINATION; Afghans, Too, Mark a Day of Disaster: A Hero Was Lost&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The attackers' names were alternately given as Dahmane Abd al-Sattar, husband of [[Malika El Aroud]], and Bouraoui el-Ouaer; or 34-year-old Karim Touzani and 26-year-old Kacem Bakkali.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, Maria do Ceu. &quot;Islamist and Middle Eastern Terrorism: A Threat to Europe?&quot;. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attackers claimed to be [[Belgium|Belgians]] originally from [[Morocco]]. However, their passports turned out to be stolen and their nationality was later determined to be [[Tunisia]]n. Waiting for almost three weeks (during which they also interviewed [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]) for an interview opportunity, on September 8, 2001, an aide to Massoud recalls the would-be suicide attackers &quot;were so worried&quot; and threatened to leave if the interview did not happen in the next 24 hours (until September 10, 2001). They were finally granted an interview. During the interview they set off a bomb that had been hidden in their videocamera. Commander Massoud died in a helicopter that was taking him to a hospital. The explosion also killed Mohammed Asim Suhail, a United Front official, while Mohammad Fahim Dashty and [[Massoud Khalili]] were injured. One of the suicide attackers, Bouraoui, was also killed by the explosion while Dahmane was captured and shot while trying to escape. 

Despite initial denials by the United Front, news of Massoud's death was reported almost immediately, appearing on the BBC, and in European and North American newspapers on September 10, 2001. On September 16, however, the United Front officially announced that Massoud had died of injuries in the suicide attack. Massoud was buried in his home village of [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]] in the Panjshir Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/world/rebel-chief-who-fought-the-taliban-is-buried.html &quot;Rebel Chief Who Fought The Taliban Is Buried&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral, although happening in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of people. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq-zqA1DMWs see video]).

Afghan journalist Fahim Dashty summarized: &quot;He was the only one, ever, to serve Afghanistan, to serve Afghans. To do a lot of things for Afghanistan, for Afghans. And we lost him.&quot; ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSOkVkvIl3A see video])

The assassination on September 9, 2001, was not the first time Al Qaeda, the Taliban, the Pakistani ISI and before them the Soviet KGB, the Afghan communist KHAD and Hekmatyar had tried to assassinate Massoud. He survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years. The first attempt on Massoud's life was carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975 when Massoud was only 22 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;/&gt; In early 2001 Al Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt;

'''Connection to September 11, 2001'''

The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 on U.S. soil which killed nearly 3,000 people and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. 

[[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the FBI until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the World Trade Center (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, John O'Neill told two of his friends, &quot;We're due. And we're due for something big.... Some things have happened in Afghanistan. [referring to the assassination of Massoud] I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan.... I sense a shift, and I think things are going to happen... soon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |url =http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/script.html|title =The Man Who Knew | publisher = [[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; John O'Neill died on September 11, 2001, when the south tower collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt; 

U.S. Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] (R) would later claim that he immediately saw the assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud as a sign that &quot;something terrible [was] about to happen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; Rohrabacher recounted his convictions in a 2004 speech to congress: &quot;As I mourned his loss, I struggled to fully understand the significance of his death. Then it dawned on me. It dawned on me why Massoud had been assassinated. America was going to be attacked. It would be so monstrous that bin Laden's gang in Afghanistan wanted to cut us off from a means of counterattacking them in their base of operations in Afghanistan. We would have turned to Massoud if we were attacked. That is what we would have done, and they were cutting us off from turning to Massoud, but now Massoud was dead. Perhaps his death was a signal to set the planned attack on our country in motion....&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; 
 
Analysts  believe [[Osama bin Laden]] ordered the assassination to help his Taliban protectors and ensure he would have their protection and co-operation in Afghanistan. Following the assassination, Osama bin Laden had an emissary deliver a cassette of Dahmane speaking of his love for his wife and his decision to blow himself up as well as $500 in an envelope to settle a debt, to the assassin's widow.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Suicide Bomber's Widow Soldiers On&quot; http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/elaroud/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) and [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]], an Afghan [[Wahhabi]] Islamist, have also been mentioned as possible organizers or collaborators of the Massoud assassins.&lt;ref name = &quot;mlqamx&quot;&gt;Anderson, Jon Lee (June 10, 2002). &quot;The assassins&quot;, ''The New Yorker'', Vol.78, Iss. 15; p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The assassins are said to have entered United Front (Northern Alliance) territory under the auspices of the [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] and had his assistance in bypassing &quot;normal security procedures.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;mlqamx&quot;/&gt; 

'''Investigative commission'''

In April 2003, the [[Karzai administration]] announced the setup of a commission to investigate the assassination of Massoud, as the country celebrated the 11th anniversary of the defeat of the communist government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/29/world/aftereffects-briefly-noted-afghan-panel-to-investigate-massoud-s-death.html &quot;AFTEREFFECTS: Briefly Noted; AFGHAN PANEL TO INVESTIGATE MASSOUD'S DEATH&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The French secret service revealed on October 16, 2003 that the camera used by Massoud's assassins had been stolen in December 2000 in [[Grenoble]], France from a photojournalist, Jean-Pierre Vincendet, who was then working on a story on that city's Christmas store window displays. By tracing the camera's serial number, the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was able to determine that Vincendet was its original owner. The French secret service and the FBI then began working on tracing the route the camera took between the time it was taken from Vincendet and the Massoud assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2003/october/oct172003.html &quot;TV camera rigged to kill Afghan rebel Masood stolen in France: police&quot;], ''Agence France-Presse'', October 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===National Hero of Afghanistan===
[[File:Ahmad Shah Massoud.jpg|thumb|220px|]]

{{rquote|right|Massoud's personal mysticism led him to fight without hatred, bitterness, or spirit of revenge, regarding armed conflict only as an imposed and necessary evil in order to defend his people's freedom, certainly not as an end in itself to be enjoyed as bloodlust or intoxication with power. He always provided protection for humanitarian relief in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances, looked for reconciliation with defeated enemies, and invariably treated his war prisoners with humanity and dignity. To this I was witness ... Such moral integrity in the midst of warfare ranks Massoud as one of the very few « philosopher kings » in history, that is, men who have been forced to wage war so as to protect their nation and people, but who detested war in itself and sought no personal political gain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahmadshahmassoud.com/modules.php?name=Pages&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=74 Thoughts on Commander Massoud ] by [[Princeton University]] Prof. Michael Barry&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Massoud was the only main Afghan leader who never left Afghanistan in the fight against the Soviet Union and later in the fight against the Taliban Emirate.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/27/massoud.afghanistan/ |title = He would have found Bin Laden| publisher = CNN | date=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Geographic about that time concluded: &quot;The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres [was] Ahmad Shah Massoud.&quot; ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpQI6HKV-ZY see video]) In the areas under his direct control such as Panjshir, some parts of Parwan and Takhar Massoud established democratic institutions. One refugee who cramped his family of 27 into an old jeep to flee from the Taliban to the area of Massoud described Massoud's territory in 1997 as &quot;the last tolerant corner of Afghanistan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journeyman Picture/ABC Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1997 |url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI |title = Massoud's Last Stand| publisher = Journeyman Pictures/ABC Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; About his life in Massoud's area he stated:&quot;I feel freedom here. I like... you know, nobody bothers me. I do my job. I take care of my family. The way which I like I live in this area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Journeyman Picture/ABC Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1997 |url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI |title = Massoud's Last Stand| publisher = [[Journeyman Pictures/ABC Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Afghan Interim Government under president [[Hamid Karzai]] officially awarded Massoud the title of &quot;Hero of the Afghan Nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2004|url =http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101304.shtml|title =Playing the Massoud card| publisher = Eurasianet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analyst in 2004 put it this way: &quot;One man holds a greater political punch than all 18 living [Afghan] presidential candidates combined. Though already dead for three years.... Since his death on September 9, 2001 at the hands of two al Qaeda-linked Islamic radicals, Massoud has been transformed from mujahedin to national hero—if not saint. Pictures of Massoud, the Afghan mujahedin who battled the Soviets, other warlords, and the Taliban for more than 20 years, vastly outnumber those of any other Afghan including those of Karzai.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2004|url =http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101304.shtml|title =Playing the Massoud card| publisher = [[Eurasianet.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], one of the closest friends of Massoud, was Karzai's strongest rival in the Afghan Presidential Elections of 2009. Dr. Abdullah said about Massoud: &quot;He was everything. He was a friend. He was a leader. He was a teacher without acting as a teacher.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYmRVY0eWhk&amp;feature=search |title = He would have found Bin Laden| publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Sebastian Junger reports: &quot;A lot of people who knew him felt that he was the best hope for that part of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt; Junger who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud further states: &quot;Afghanistan's government has been accused of being corrupt and weak. Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength.... He would have been very hard for the [insurgents] to intimidate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt; Shorish-Shamley, a women's rights activist, says: &quot;If they [al Qaeda leaders] were hiding under a rock, he would have found them. He was that type of person. He would have found bin Laden.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt; Among supporters of the Taliban or [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s Hezb-i Islami he is obviously seen differently. Still, a 2009 CNN report concludes: &quot;He remains today a hero on the streets of Kabul among a people who have more faith in a leader from the past than the leaders of the future.&quot; ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYmRVY0eWhk&amp;feature=search see video]) 

Today Panjshir - the home of Massoud - &quot;is arguably the most peaceful place in the entire country. A small US military reconstruction team is based here, but there are none of the signs of foreign occupation that exist elsewhere. Even Afghan soldiers are few and far between. Instead, the people like to boast about how they keep their own security,&quot; observes the United Arab Emirates newspaper The National.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |url =http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100810/FOREIGN/708099910/1135/editorials |title = Reconciliation plans worry Afghans in the north| publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Panjshir (and Takhar) remain realistic however: &quot;We are very sure that if they [the Taliban] come back they will not leave one man in Panjshir alive. If we don't fight they will kill us, so if we fight we will at least die with glory.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The National&quot;/&gt; The National further states: &quot;Those who knew him say he would never have accepted the Taliban's return to power and they have vowed to defend his memory.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The National&quot;/&gt; 

Many documentaries, books and movies have been made about Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud is the subject of [[Ken Follett]]'s ''Lie Down With Lions'', a novel about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He also plays a significant role in [[James McGee (author)|James McGee]]'s thriller ''Crow's War''. Another is ''Fire'' by Sebastian Junger.  Junger was one of the last Western journalists to interview Massoud in depth. The bulk of this interview was first published in March 2001 for ''[[National Geographic]]'''s Adventure Magazine, along with photographs by the renowned Iranian photographer Reza Deghati.

The Massoud Foundation was established in 2003, as an independent, non-aligned, non-profitable and non-political organization by people who have been affected by Massoud. It provides humanitarian assistance to Afghans especially in the fields of health care and education. It also runs programs in the fields of culture, construction, agriculture and welfare.

===Lion of Panjshir===
Massoud was named &quot;The Afghan who won the cold war&quot; by the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;/&gt; He defeated the Soviet Red Army nine times in the Panjshir.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt; The Soviet Union's defeat was not only a defeat in Afghanistan, but led to the collapse of the Soviet system and was followed by the liberation of the Central Asian and Eastern European countries from Moscow's control. His struggle against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan earned him the name &quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot;.

&quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot;, is a rhyme and play on words in [[Persian language|Persian]], which alludes to the strength of his resistance against the Soviet Union, the mythological exaltation of the lion in [[Persian language|Persian]] literature, and finally, the place name of the [[Panjshir Valley]], where Massoud was born. The place name of &quot;Panjshir&quot; Valley in [[Persian language|Persian]] means (Valley of the) Five Lions. Thus, the phrase &quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot;, which in [[Persian language|Persian]] is &quot;Shir-e-Panjshir,&quot; شیر پنجشیر is a rhyming play on words, with the connotation &quot;Lion of the Five Lions&quot;.

===Warning the world (September 11, 2001)===
In spring 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud  addressed the European Parliament in Brussels stating that behind the situation in Afghanistan there was the regime in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkw-g27AUKE |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = [[EU media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also stated his conviction that without the support of Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden and Saudi Arabia the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year, also because the Afghan population was ready to rise against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;/&gt;  Addressing the United States specifically he issued the warning that should the U.S. not work for peace in Afghanistan and put pressure on Pakistan to cease their support to the Taliban, the problems of Afghanistan would soon become the problems of the U.S. and the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;/&gt;

Declassified Defense Intelligence Agency documents from November 2001 show that Massoud had gained &quot;limited knowledge... regarding the intentions of [al-Qaeda] to perform a terrorist act against the US on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;/&gt; They also point out that he warned about such attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, French singer-songwriter and author [[Damien Saez]] wrote a song about 9/11 entitled &quot;Massoud&quot;. He was also  featured in the [[ABC Television]] mini-series ''[[The Path to 9/11]]'', which aired commercial-free in the USA in 2006, on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The mini-series depicts Massoud warning U.S. intelligence agents of the coming U.S.  attack by [[al-Qaeda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tti6ubowDbM&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=0A54B2CD0E22082B&amp;index=34 Ahmad Shah Massoud's warning to the United States, ''The Path to 9/11''] (video clip).&lt;/ref&gt; and Massoud's September 9, 2001 assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eG_8kPn_cs&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=0A54B2CD0E22082B&amp;index=36 Assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud, ''The Path to 9/11''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal===
Massoud was married to Sediqa Massoud. They have one son (Ahmad born in 1989) and five daughters (Fatima born in 1992, Mariam born in 1993, Ayesha born in 1995, Zohra born in 1996 and Nasrine born in 1998). 

Massoud's wife and his children live in Iran. In 2005 Sediqa Massoud published a personal account on her life with Massoud (co-authored by two women's rights activists and friends of Sediqa Massoud, Chékéba Hachemi and Marie-Francoise Colombani) called ''&quot;Pour l'amour de Massoud&quot;'' (For the love of Massoud) in which she describes a very decent and loving husband.

After his death, Massoud was interred in a mausoleum in [[Panjshir Valley]]. A larger mausoleum is currently being constructed to replace the current one.

The family has a great deal of prestige in the politics of Afghanistan. One of his six brothers, [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]], was a vice-president of Afghanistan under Hamid Karzai. There have been unsuccessful attempts on the life of [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]] in 2004 and late 2009. The Associated Press reported that 8 Afghans died in the attempt on Ahmad Zia Massoud's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=e97ECBBJ_mU|title=Associated Press Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another brother, Ahmad Wali Massoud, was Afghanistan's Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kabulcenter.org/?p=100 Solutions to Security Challenges: Interview with Ahmad Wali Massoud], [[Kabul Center for Strategic Studies]], 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the Nahzat-e-Mili political party&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=jdEgt78b0tIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=nahzat-e-mili&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4wMjn58qi4&amp;sig=KsNUJWwQnFF7Y_5a7RnB-r8u1XQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mxnATdrUB-Hw0gHFtOCUBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=nahzat-e-mili&amp;f=false Afghanistan, Government, Political parties], CIA World Factbook 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which is now known as the National Movement of Afghanistan party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html Afghanistan, Government, Political parties], CIA World Factbook 2010, last updated April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis.gif|thumb|280px| [[Athanasius Kircher|Athanasius Kircher's]] map of Atlantis, in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. From ''Mundus Subterraneus'' 1669, published in Amsterdam. The map is oriented with south at the top.]]
'''Atlantis''' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], {{polytonic|Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος}}, &quot;island of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]&quot;) is a [[legend]]ary island first mentioned in [[Plato]]'s dialogues ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', written about 360 BC.

In Plato's account, Atlantis was a [[naval power]] lying &quot;in front of the [[Pillars of Hercules]]&quot; that conquered many parts of [[Western Europe]] and [[Africa]] 9,000 years before the time of [[Solon]], or approximately 9600 BC. After a failed attempt to invade [[Classical Athens|Athens]], Atlantis sank into the ocean &quot;in a single day and night of misfortune&quot;.

Scholars dispute whether and how much Plato's story or account was inspired by older traditions. Some scholars argue Plato drew upon memories of past events such as the [[Thera eruption]] or the [[Trojan War]], while others insist that he took inspiration from contemporary events like the destruction of [[Helike]] in 373 BC&lt;ref&gt;Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' is usually dated 360 BC; it was followed by his ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or the failed [[Sicilian Expedition|Athenian invasion of Sicily]] in 415–413 BC.

The possible existence of a genuine Atlantis was discussed throughout [[classical antiquity]], but it was usually rejected and occasionally parodied by later authors. As [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] states: &quot;It is only in modern times that people have taken the Atlantis story seriously; no one did so in antiquity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, [http://books.google.com/books?id=R6_g1cNj2jMC Greek Mythography in the Roman World], Oxford University Press (2004) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Timaeus'' remained known in a Latin rendition by [[Calcidius]] through the Middle Ages, and the allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up by [[Humanism|Humanists]] in [[utopia]]n works of several [[Renaissance]] writers, like [[Francis Bacon]]'s &quot;[[New Atlantis]]&quot;. Atlantis inspires today's literature, from science fiction to comic books to films. Its name has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations.

==Plato's account==
[[File:Plato Timaeus.jpg|Right|thumb|A 15th-century Latin translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'']]
Plato's dialogues ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', written in 360 BC, contain the earliest references to Atlantis. For unknown reasons, Plato never completed ''Critias''. Plato introduced Atlantis in ''Timaeus'':

{{quote|For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;''Timaeus'' 24e–25a, R. G. Bury translation (Loeb Classical Library).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The four persons appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians [[Critias]] and [[Hermocrates]] as well as the philosophers [[Socrates]] and [[Timaeus of Locri]], although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. While most likely all of these people actually lived, these dialogues, written as if recorded, may have been the invention of Plato. In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic dialogues]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.

The ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that would make the perfect example, and follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the &quot;perfect society&quot; and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the &quot;perfect&quot; traits described in the ''Republic''. Critias claims that his accounts of ancient Athens and Atlantis stem from a visit to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] by the legendary Athenian lawgiver [[Solon]] in the 6th century BC. In Egypt, Solon met a priest of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]], who translated the history of ancient Athens and Atlantis, recorded on papyri in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], into [[Greek language|Greek]]. According to [[Plutarch]], Solon met with &quot;Psenophis of Heliopolis, and [[Sonchis of Sais]], the most learned of all the priests&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Solon.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch refers here to events that would have happened seven centuries before he wrote of them.

According to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] gods of old divided the land so that each god might own a lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than Ancient Libya and Asia Minor combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis—Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it afterwards was sunk by an [[earthquake]] and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. The Egyptians, Plato asserted, described Atlantis as an island comprising mostly mountains in the northern portions and along the shore, and encompassing a great plain of an oblong shape in the south &quot;extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&amp;nbsp;km; 345&amp;nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&amp;nbsp;km; 230&amp;nbsp;mi].&quot; Fifty stadia [9&amp;nbsp;km; 6&amp;nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides...broke it off all round about&lt;ref&gt;''Critias'' 113, Bury translation.&lt;/ref&gt;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&amp;nbsp;km; 0.57&amp;nbsp;mi].&lt;ref&gt;''Critias'' 116a, Bury translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's myth, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, Atlas, was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island towards the pillars of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].&lt;/ref&gt; The other four pairs of twins—Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes—were also given &quot;rule over many men, and a large territory.&quot;

Poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great ca
