      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other uses, see [[Clodius (disambiguation)]].''

'''Clodius''' is an alternate form of the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' [[Claudius_(gens)|Claudius]], a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] ''[[gens]]'' that was traditionally regarded as [[Sabine]] in origin. The alternation of ''o'' and ''au'' is characteristic of the Sabine dialect. The [[grammatical gender|feminine form]] is '''Clodia'''.

==Republican era==
===Publius Clodius Pulcher===
&lt;!--the footnote at the end of this section is the source for the entire section--&gt;
During the [[Roman Republic|Late Republic]], the spelling ''Clodius'' is most prominently associated with [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], a [[populares|popularist]] politician who gave up his patrician status through [[Roman adoption|adoption]] in order to qualify for the office of [[tribune#Plebeian Tribune|tribune of the ''plebs'']]. Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban ''[[plebs]]'', supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds (''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]''); because of his ideology, ''Clodius'' has often been taken as a more &quot;plebeian&quot; spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. Clodius's two elder brothers, the [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 54 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]] who was [[Roman consul|consul]] in 54 BC and the [[Gaius Claudius Pulcher (praetor 56 BC)|C. Claudius Pulcher]] who was praetor in 56 BC, conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling.

The view that ''Clodius'' represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by Clodius's chief modern-era biographer. In ''The Patrician Tribune'', W. Jeffrey Tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with Clodius's sisters and that &quot;the political explanation … is almost certainly wrong.&quot; A plebeian branch of the ''gens'', the Claudii Marcelli, retained the supposedly patrician spelling, while there is some [[epigraphy|inscriptional]] evidence that the ''-o-'' form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the &quot;patrician tribune&quot; Clodius. Tatum argues that the use of ''-o-'' by the &quot;chic&quot; [[Clodia Metelli]] was a fashionable affectation, and that Clodius, whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation, was imitating his stylish sibling. The [[Claudius (gens)#Etymology|linguistic variation of ''o'' for ''au'']] was characteristic of the [[Umbrian language]], of which [[Sabine]] was a branch. Forms using ''o'' were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s BC, and the use of ''Clodius'' would have been either a whimsical gesture of [[pastoral|pastoral fantasy]], or a trendy assertion of [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jeffrey Tatum, ''The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher'' (University of North Caroline Press, 1999), pp. 247–248 [http://books.google.com/books?id=YHGYYaHLgfgC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=%22Clodius+or+Claudius%3F%22+inauthor:Tatum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Clodius%20or%20Claudius%3F%22%20inauthor%3ATatum&amp;f=false online.] The idea that the form ''Clodius'' announced ethnic identity is suggested also by Gary D. Farney, ''Ethnic identity and aristocratic competition in Republican Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 89 [http://books.google.com/books?id=jdFF_Pc7GPMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA89&amp;dq=Clodius+Claudius+spelling&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Clodius%20Claudius%20spelling&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Clodii of the Republic===
In addition to Clodius and his sisters, Clodii from the Republican era include:

* [[Clodius Aesopus]], a tragic actor in the 50s BC who may have been a [[freedman]] of one of the Clodii Pulchri.
* [[Clodia Pulchra]], daughter of Clodius Pulcher and [[Fulvia]], the first wife of imperator August.
* [[Clodia Pulchra]], daughter of Appius Clodius Pulcher, known in [[Catullus]]' poems as &quot;[[Lesbia]]&quot;.

==Imperial era==
People using the name ''Clodius'' during the period of the [[Roman Empire]] include:
* [[Caius Clodius Vestalis]], possible builder of the [[Via Clodia]]
* [[Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus]], senator and philosopher during the reign of [[Nero]]
* [[Lucius Clodius Macer]], a ''[[legatus]]'' who revolted against Nero
* [[Publius Clodius Quirinalis]], from [[Arelate]] in [[Gaul]], teacher of [[rhetoric]] in time of [[Nero]]
* Decimus Clodius Septimius Albinus, commonly known as [[Clodius Albinus]], rival emperor 196-197
* Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus, known as [[Pupienus]], co-emperor 238
* [[Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius]], consul 379

===Clodii Celsini===
The Clodii Celsini continued to practice the [[ancient Roman religion|traditional religions of antiquity]] in the face of [[Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|Christian hegemony]] through at least the 4th century, when Clodius Celsinus Adelphius (see below) [[Religious conversion|converted]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernice M. Kaczynski, &quot;Faltonia Betitia Proba: A Virgilian Cento in Praise of Christ,&quot; in ''Women Writing Latin'' (Routledge, 2002), vol. 1, p. 132 [http://books.google.com/books?id=rjzBMLaT_lcC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Clodius+Celsinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Clodius%20Celsinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this branch include:
* [[Quintus Fabius Clodius Agrippianus Celsinus]], [[proconsul]] of [[Caria]] in 249 and the son of Clodius Celsinus (b. ''ca.'' 185); see for other members of the family.
* [[Clodius Celsinus Adelphius]], ''[[praefectus urbi]]'' in 351.

'''Marcus Tullius Cicero''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ɨ|r|oʊ}}; {{IPA-la|ˈkikeroː|classical}}; January 3, 106 BC &amp;ndash; December 7, 43 BC; sometimes anglicized as '''Tully'''), was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[philosopher]], [[statesman]], [[lawyer]], [[political theorist]], and [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutionalist]]. He came from a wealthy [[municipium|municipal]] family of the [[equestrian order]], and is widely considered one of Rome's greatest [[rhetoric|orators]] and prose stylists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Rawson|Rawson, E.]]: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) p.303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964)p.300-301&lt;/ref&gt;

He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of [[Greek philosophy]] and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary (with neologisms such as ''[[humanitas]]'', ''qualitas'', ''quantitas'', and ''essentia'')&lt;ref&gt;Conte, G.B.: &quot;Latin Literature: a history&quot; (1987) p.199&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishing himself as a [[linguist]], translator, and philosopher. An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero thought that his political career was his most important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. [[Cornelius Nepos]], the 1st century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail &quot;concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government&quot; that their reader had little need for a history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Atticus Atticus]'' 16, trans. John Selby Watson.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's speeches and letters remain some of the most important primary sources that survive on the last days of the [[Roman Republic]].

During the chaotic latter half of the 1st century BC marked by [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]] and the dictatorship of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], Cicero championed a return to the traditional [[Roman Republic|republican]] government. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. &quot;Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self control, and adversity with more fortitude!&quot; wrote [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|C. Asinius Pollio]], a contemporary Roman statesman and historian.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, H.J.:&quot;This was Cicero&quot; (1964) p.296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castren and Pietilä-Castren: &quot;Antiikin käsikirja&quot; /&quot;Handbook of antiquity&quot; (2000) p.237&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero became an enemy of [[Mark Antony]], attacking him in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]]. He was [[Proscription|proscribed]] as an enemy of the state by the [[Second Triumvirate]] and subsequently murdered in 43 BC.

==Personal life==
{{Main|Personal life of Marcus Tullius Cicero}}

===Early life===
Cicero was born in 106 BC in [[Arpinum]], a hill town 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Rome. His father was a well-to-do member of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]] with good connections in Rome, though as a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life. He compensated for this by studying extensively. Although little is known about Cicero's mother, Helvia, it was common for the wives of important Roman citizens to be responsible for the management of the household. Cicero's brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, E.: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) p.5-6; Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2 16.26.2] (Quintus to Cicero)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero's [[cognomen]], or personal surname, comes from the Latin for [[chickpea]], ''cicer''. [[Plutarch]] explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. However, it is more likely that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas.&lt;ref&gt;Trollope, Anthony. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8945/8945-h/8945-h.htm The Life of Cicero]'' Volume 1. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames: the famous family names of [[Fabius]], [[Lentulus]], and [[Piso]] come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make ''Cicero'' more glorious than ''[[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]'' (&quot;Swollen-ankled&quot;) and ''[[Catulus]]'' (&quot;Puppy&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#1.3 1.3&amp;ndash;5]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Young Cicero Reading.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Young Cicero Reading, 1464 fresco, now at the [[Wallace Collection]]]]

During this period in Roman history, to be considered &quot;cultured&quot; meant being able to speak both Latin and Greek. The Roman upper class often preferred Greek to Latin in private correspondence.{{Dubious|date=May 2010}} Cicero, like most of his contemporaries, was therefore educated in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, poets and historians. The most prominent teachers of oratory of that time were themselves Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, E.:&quot;Cicero, a portrait&quot; (1975) p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, A.:&quot;Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician&quot; (2001) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#2.2 2.2]&lt;/ref&gt; affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#3.2 3.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Titus Pomponius]]. The latter two became Cicero's friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the cognomen &quot;Atticus&quot; for his [[Hellenistic civilization|philhellenism]]) would become Cicero's longtime chief emotional support and adviser.

Cicero wanted to pursue a public civil service career along the steps of the [[Cursus honorum]]. In 90 BC–88 BC, he served both [[Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] as they campaigned in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost. Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83-81 BC. His first major case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of [[Sextus Roscius]] on the charge of [[patricide]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, E.: &quot;Cicero, a portrait&quot; (1975) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being [[Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus|Chrysogonus]], were favorites of Sulla. At this time it would have been easy for Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.

In 79 BC, Cicero left for [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Rhodes]], perhaps because of the potential wrath of Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, H.J.: &quot;This was Cicero&quot; (1940) p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero traveled to Athens, where he again met [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], who had become an honorary citizen of Athens and introduced Cicero to some significant Athenians. In Athens, Cicero visited the sacred sites of the philosophers, but not before he consulted different [[rhetoric]]ians in order to learn a less physically exhausting style of speech. His chief instructor was the rhetorician [[Apollonius Molon|Apollonius Molon of Rhodes]]. He instructed Cicero in a more expansive and less intense form of oratory that would define Cicero's individual style in years to come.

Cicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him introducing Greek philosophy to Roman culture, creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin. In 87 BC, [[Philo of Larissa]], the head of the [[Academy]] that was founded by [[Plato]] in [[Athens]] about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome. Cicero, &quot;inspired by an extraordinary zeal for philosophy&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson:&quot;Cicero, a portrait&quot; (1975) p.18&lt;/ref&gt; sat enthusiastically at his feet and absorbed Plato's philosophy, even calling Plato his god. He admired especially Plato's moral and political seriousness, but he also respected his breadth of imagination. Cicero nonetheless rejected Plato's [[Theory of Forms|theory of Ideas]].

===Family===
Cicero married [[Terentia]] probably at the age of 27, in 79 BC. According to the upper class [[Wiktionary:mores#English|mores]] of the day it was a marriage of convenience, but endured harmoniously for some 30 years. Terentia's family was wealthy, probably the [[Plebs|plebeian]] noble house of Terenti Varrones, thus meeting the needs of Cicero's political ambitions in both economic and social terms. She had a half sister (or perhaps first cousin) named Fabia, who as a child had become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a very great honour. Terentia was a strong willed woman and (citing Plutarch) &quot;she took more interest in her husband's political career than she allowed him to take in household affairs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, E.: &quot;Cicero, a portrait&quot; (1975) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 50s BC, Cicero's letters to Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained to his friends that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the marriage simply could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero's involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears to have taken place in 51 BC or shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Treggiari, ''Terentia, Tullia and Publilia: the women of Cicero's family'', London: Routledge, 2007, pp. 76f.&lt;/ref&gt; In 46 or 45 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, op. cit., p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his [[ward (law)|ward]]. It is thought that Cicero needed her money, particularly after having to repay the [[dowry]] of Terentia, who came from a wealthy family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawson_1975_225&quot;&gt;Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p.225&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage did not last long.

Although his marriage to Terentia was one of convenience, it is commonly known that Cicero held great love for his daughter [[Tullia Ciceronis|Tullia]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskell H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p.95&lt;/ref&gt; When she suddenly became ill in February 45 BC and died after having seemingly recovered from giving birth to a son in January, Cicero was stunned. &quot;I have lost the one thing that bound me to life&quot; he wrote to Atticus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haskell_1964_249&quot;&gt;Haskell, H.J.:&quot;This was Cicero&quot; (1964) p.249&lt;/ref&gt; Atticus told him to come for a visit during the first weeks of his bereavement, so that he could comfort him when his pain was at its greatest. In Atticus's large library, Cicero read everything that the Greek philosophers had written about overcoming grief, &quot;but my sorrow defeats all consolation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'', 12.14. Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar and [[Marcus Junius Brutus Caepio|Brutus]] as well as [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] sent him letters of condolence.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, E.:''Cicero'' p.226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero hoped that his son [[Cicero Minor|Marcus]] would become a philosopher like him, but Marcus himself wished for a military career. He joined the army of [[Pompey]] in 49 BC and after Pompey's defeat at [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] 48 BC, he was pardoned by Caesar. Cicero sent him to Athens to study as a disciple of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Cratippus|Kratippos]] {{dn|date = October 2010}} in 48 BC, but he used this absence from &quot;his father's vigilant eye&quot; to &quot;eat, drink and be merry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Haskell|first=H.J|title=This was Cicero|year=1964|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cicero's murder he joined the army of the ''[[Liberatores]]'' but was later pardoned by [[Augustus]]. Augustus' bad conscience for having put Cicero on the [[proscription]] list during the [[Second Triumvirate]] led him to aid considerably Marcus Minor's career. He became an [[augur]], and was nominated [[consul]] in 30 BC together with Augustus. As such, he was responsible for revoking the honors of [[Mark Antony]], who was responsible for the proscription, and could in this way take revenge. Later he was appointed [[proconsul]] of [[Syria]] and the province of [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Paavo Castren &amp; L. Pietilä-Castren: ''Antiikin käsikirja/Encyclopedia of the Ancient World''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public career ==
{{Main|Political career of Marcus Tullius Cicero}}
[[File:Cicero.PNG|thumb|200px|left|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]

===Quaestor===
His first office was as one of the twenty annual [[Quaestor]]s, a training post for serious public administration in a diversity of areas, but with a traditional emphasis on administration and rigorous accounting of public monies under the guidance of a senior magistrate or provincial commander. Cicero served as quaestor in western [[Sicily]] in 75 BC and demonstrated honesty and integrity in his dealings with the inhabitants. As a result, the grateful Sicilians asked Cicero to prosecute [[Gaius Verres]], a governor of Sicily, who had badly plundered Sicily. His prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success {{Clarify| date=October 2010}} for Cicero. Upon the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. However, the view that Cicero may have taken the case for other reasons is viable. [[Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]] was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in [[Rome]]; to beat him would guarantee much success and prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Nevertheless, his oratory skill is shown through his character assassination of Verres and various other persuasive techniques used towards the jury. One such example is found in Against Verres I,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works. London: Penguin Books. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; where he states 'with you on this bench, gentlemen, with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Marcus Acilius Glabrio]] as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve'. Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there was no regular media at the time. Cicero was neither a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] nor even a [[nobiles|noble]], and his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/268/2/11.html Bartleby.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero grew up in a time of civil unrest and war. [[Sulla]]’s victory in the first of many civil wars led to a new constitutional framework that undermined ''[[libertas]]'' (liberty), the fundamental value of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla’s reforms strengthened the position of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] class, contributing to that class’s growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian ''eques'' and a ''[[novus homo]]'', but more importantly he was a [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutionalist]]. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured he would &quot;command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes.&quot; The fact that the ''[[optimates]]'' faction never truly accepted Cicero undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he was able to successfully ascend the Roman ''[[cursus honorum]]'', holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: [[quaestor]] in 75 (age 31), [[aedile]] in 69 (age 37), and [[praetor]] in 66 (age 40), where he served as president of the &quot;Reclamation&quot; (or extortion) Court. He was then elected [[consul]] at age 43.

===Consul===
Cicero was elected Consul for the year 63 BC. His co-consul for the year, [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]], played a minor role. During his year in office, he thwarted a conspiracy centred on assassinating him and overthrowing the [[Roman Republic]] with the help of foreign armed forces, led by [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. Cicero procured a ''[[Senatus Consultum Ultimum|Senatus Consultum de Re Publica Defendenda]]'' (a declaration of [[martial law]]), and he drove Catiline from the city with four vehement speeches (the [[Catiline Orations]]), which to this day remain outstanding examples of his rhetorical style. The Orations listed Catiline and his followers' debaucheries, and denounced Catiline's senatorial sympathizers as roguish and dissolute debtors, clinging to Catiline as a final and desperate hope. Cicero demanded that Catiline and his followers leave the city. At the conclusion of his first speech, Catiline burst{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} from the [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|Temple of Jupiter Stator]]. In his following speeches, Cicero did not directly address Catiline. He delivered &lt;!--maybe; some scholars think not all the Catilinarians were actually delivered, but were rather published--&gt;the second and third orations before the [[SPQR|people]], and the final before the Senate. By these speeches, Cicero wanted to prepare the Senate for the worst possible case; he also delivered more evidence against Catiline.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, Selected Works, Penguin Books Ltd, Great Britain, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|''Cicero Denounces Catiline'', [[fresco]] by [[Cesare Maccari]], 1882-1888]]

Catiline fled and left behind his followers to start the revolution from within while Catiline assaulted the city with an army of &quot;moral bankrupts and honest fanatics&quot;. Catiline had attempted to involve the [[Allobroges]], a tribe of [[Transalpine Gaul]], in their plot, but Cicero, working with the Gauls, was able to seize letters which incriminated the five conspirators and forced them to confess their crimes in front of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Cicero|title=In Catilinam|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?lookup=Cic.+Catil.+3.4 3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sallust|title=Bellum Catilinae|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#40 40-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Plutarch]]|title=Cicero|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#18.4 18.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate then deliberated upon the conspirators' punishment. As it was the dominant advisory body to the various [[legislative]] assemblies rather than a [[judicial]] body, there were limits to its power; however, martial law was in effect, and it was feared that simple house arrest or exile — the standard options — would not remove the threat to the state. At first most in the Senate spoke for the &quot;extreme penalty&quot;; many were then swayed by Julius Caesar, who decried the precedent it would set and argued in favor of life imprisonment in various Italian towns. [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] then rose in defence of the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] and all the Senate finally agreed on the matter. Cicero had the conspirators taken to the [[Tullianum]], the notorious Roman prison, where they were strangled. Cicero himself accompanied the former consul [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]], one of the conspirators, to the Tullianum. Cicero received the honorific &quot;''[[Pater Patriae]]''&quot; for his efforts to suppress the conspiracy, but lived thereafter in fear of trial or exile for having put Roman citizens to death without trial.

===Exile and return===
In 60 BC Julius Caesar invited Cicero to be the fourth member of his existing partnership with [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], an assembly that would eventually be called the [[First Triumvirate]]. Cicero refused the invitation because he suspected it would undermine the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'', 1984 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 58 BC, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], the [[tribune of the plebs]], introduced a law (the ''[[Leges Clodiae]]'') threatening exile to anyone who executed a Roman citizen without a trial. Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, and having had a public falling out with Clodius, was clearly the intended target of the law. Cicero argued that the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey. When help was not forthcoming, he went into exile. He arrived at [[Thessalonica]], [[Greece]], on May 23, 58 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', 1964 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', 1964 p.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#32 32]&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]: &quot;Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, H.J.: &quot;This was Cicero&quot; (1964) p.201&lt;/ref&gt; After the intervention of recently elected [[tribune of Plebs|tribune]] [[Titus Annius Milo]], the senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast a single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on August 5, 57 BC, landing at [[Brundisium]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters'' (in a Swedish translation)&lt;/ref&gt; He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter [[Tullia Ciceronis|Tullia]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskell. H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p.204&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero tried to reintegrate himself into politics, but his attack on a bill of Caesar's proved unsuccessful. The conference at Luca in 56 BC forced Cicero to make a recantation and pledge his support to the triumvirate. With this, a cowed Cicero retreated to his literary works. It is uncertain whether he had any direct involvement in politics for the following few years.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, M: &quot;Cicero: Selected Works&quot;, p67&lt;/ref&gt; But from May, 51 BC, Cicero was absent from Italy till November, 50 BC, as proconsul of Cilicia — which, to his chagrin, he was obliged to undertake owing to the regulation in Pompey's law (de provinciis) of the previous year enforcing a five years' interval between consulship or praetorship and a province, and providing for the interim by drawing on the ex-consuls and ex-praetors of previous years who had not had provinces. Accompanied by his brother the expraetor and exproconsul [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] as a [[Legatus|legate]], he was mostly spared from warfare due to the [[Parthians]]' interior conflicts, yet for storming a mountain fortress he earned the title of [[Imperator#Imperatores in the Roman Repubic|imperator]].

===Julius Caesar's civil war===
The struggle between [[Pompey]] and Julius Caesar grew more intense in 50 BC. Cicero chose to favour Pompey as he was in defence of the senate and Republican tradition, but at the same time he prudently avoided openly alienating Caesar. When Caesar invaded Italy in 49 BC, Cicero fled Rome. Caesar, seeking the legitimacy an endorsement by a senior senator would provide, courted Cicero's favour, but even so Cicero slipped out of Italy and traveled to Dyrrachium ([[Epidamnos]]), Illyria, where Pompey's staff was situated.&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, Anthony: ''Cicero'' pp. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero traveled with the Pompeian forces to [[Pharsalus]] in 48 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#38 38.1]&lt;/ref&gt; though he was quickly losing faith in the competence and righteousness of the Pompeian lot. Eventually, he provoked the hostility of his fellow senator [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], who told him that he would have been of more use to the cause of the ''optimates'' if he had stayed in Rome. After Caesar's victory at Pharsalus, Cicero returned to Rome only very cautiously. Caesar pardoned him and Cicero tried to adjust to the situation and maintain his political work, hoping that Caesar might revive the Republic and its institutions.

In a letter to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] on ''c.'' April 20, 46 BC, Cicero outlined his strategy under Caesar's dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken completely by surprise when the ''[[Liberatores]]'' assassinated Caesar on the [[ides of March]], 44 BC. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] called out Cicero's name, asking him to &quot;restore the Republic&quot; when he lifted the bloodstained dagger after the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Second Philippic Against Antony&lt;/ref&gt; A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to [[Trebonius]], one of the conspirators, began, &quot;How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the [[Ides of March]]&quot;!&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+10.28 10.28]&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability following the assassination. He had no respect for [[Mark Antony]], who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar's murderers. In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree not to declare Caesar to have been a tyrant, which allowed the Caesarians to have lawful support.

===Opposition to Mark Antony and death===
Cicero and Antony then became the two leading men in Rome; Cicero as spokesman for the Senate and Antony as consul, leader of the Caesarian faction, and unofficial executor of Caesar's public will. The two men had never been on friendly terms and their relationship worsened after Cicero made it clear that he felt Antony to be taking unfair liberties in interpreting Caesar's wishes and intentions. When [[Octavian]], Caesar's heir and adopted son, arrived in Italy in April, Cicero formed a plan to play him against Antony. In September he began attacking Antony in a series of speeches he called the [[Philippicae|Philippics]], after [[Demosthenes]]'s denunciations of [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Praising Octavian, he said that the young man only desired honor and would not make the same mistake as his adoptive father. During this time, Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/4*.html#19 4.19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero supported [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] as governor of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (''Gallia Cisalpina'') and urged the Senate to name Antony an enemy of the state. The speech of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus|Lucius Piso]], Caesar's father-in-law, delayed proceedings against Antony. Antony was later declared an [[enemy of the state]] when he refused to lift the siege of [[Mutina]], which was in the hands of Decimus Brutus. Cicero’s plan to drive out Antony failed. Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] to form the [[Second Triumvirate]] after the successive battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]]. The Triumvirate began [[proscription|proscribing]] their enemies and potential rivals immediately after legislating the alliance into official existence for a term of five years with consular ''[[imperium]]''. Cicero and all of his contacts and supporters were numbered among the enemies of the state, and reportedly, Octavian argued for two days against Cicero being added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#46.3 46.3&amp;ndash;5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero was one of the most viciously and doggedly hunted among the proscribed. He was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was caught December 7, 43 BC leaving his villa in [[Formiae]] in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] going to the seaside where he hoped to embark on a ship destined for Macedonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haskell_1964_293&quot;&gt;Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p.293&lt;/ref&gt; When the assassins – Herennius (a centurion) and Popilius (a tribune) – arrived, Cicero's own slaves said they had not seen him, but he was given away by Philologus, a freed slave of his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus Cicero]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haskell_1964_293&quot; /&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|200px|Cicero around age 60, from a marble bust]]

Cicero's last words are said to have been, &quot;There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier, but do try to kill me properly.&quot; He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was indicating that he wouldn't resist. According to [[Plutarch]], Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed and displayed along with his head on the [[Rostra]] in the [[Forum Romanum]] according to the tradition of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]], both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions to be displayed in that manner. According to [[Cassius Dio]] (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch),&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html#8.4 47.8.4]&lt;/ref&gt; Antony's wife [[Fulvia]] took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, A.: ''Cicero, A turbulent life'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero's son, [[Cicero Minor|Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor]], during his year as a consul in 30 BC, avenged his father's death somewhat when he announced to the Senate Mark Antony's naval defeat at [[Actium]] in 31 BC by Octavian and his capable commander-in-chief [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]]. In the same meeting the Senate voted to prohibit all future Antonius descendants from using the name Marcus. Octavian would later come upon one of his grandsons reading a book by Cicero. The boy tried to conceal the book, fearing the reaction of his grandfather. Octavian, now called Augustus, took the book from his grandson, read a part of it, and then handed it back, saying: &quot;He was a learned man, dear child, a learned man who loved his country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Cicero'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#49.5 49.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Cicero was a gifted and energetic writer, with an interest in a wide variety of subjects in keeping with the Hellenistic philosophical and rhetorical traditions in which he was trained. The quality and ready accessibility of Ciceronian texts favored very wide distribution and inclusion in teaching curricula. This influence increased after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, from which more of his writings survived than any other Latin author. Medieval philosophers were influenced by Cicero's writings on [[natural law]] and innate rights. [[Petrarch]]'s rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited as what initiated the 14th century movement called [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Wooton, D. &quot;Modern political thought&quot; (1996) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; His works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history.

While Cicero the humanist deeply influenced the culture of [[Renaissance]], Cicero the republican inspired the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the revolutionaries of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;De Burgh, W.G., &quot;The legacy of the ancient world&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Adams]] said of him &quot;As all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united than Cicero, his authority should have great weight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''American republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States'' [[Mortimer Sellers|Mortimer N. S. Sellers]], NYU Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Desmoulins]] said of the French republicans in 1789 that they were &quot;mostly young people who, nourished by the reading of Cicero at school, had become passionate enthusiasts for liberty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Aulard |first= François-Alphonse |title= Histoire politique de la Révolution française: Origines et Développement de la Démocratie et de la République
(1789-1804) |publisher= Librairie Armand Colin |year= 1901|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, no other antique personality has inspired venomous dislike as Cicero especially in more modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.R.S. &quot;Cicero's letters to Atticus&quot; (1978) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] notably referred to him as &quot;the most contemptible scoundrel in history&quot; for upholding republican &quot;democracy&quot;, while at the same time denouncing land and class reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Michael Parenti, ''The Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People's History of Ancient Rome'', 2003:86. ISBN 1-56584-797-0&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero has faced criticism for exaggerating the democratic qualities of republican Rome, and for defending the Roman oligarchy against the popular reforms of Caesar. His vain, pompous personality revealed from his letters also often led to negative characterization in modern popular depictions.

==Notable fictional portrayals==
Cicero was portrayed on the motion picture screen by British actor [[Alan Napier]] in the 1953 film ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', based on [[Julius Caesar (play)|Shakespeare's play]]. He has also been played by such noted actors as [[Michael Hordern]] (in ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''), and [[Andre Morell]] (in the 1970 ''[[Julius Caesar (1970 film)|Julius Caesar]]''). Most recently, [[List of Rome characters|Cicero]] was portrayed by [[David Bamber]] in the HBO series [[Rome (TV series)|Rome]] (2005–2007) and appeared in both seasons.

In her series of historical novels &quot;[[Masters of Rome]]&quot; [[Colleen McCullough]] presents an unflattering depiction of Cicero's career, showing him struggling with inferiority complex and vanity, morally flexible and fatally indiscreet. He is portrayed as a hero in the novel ''[[A Pillar of Iron]]'' by [[Taylor Caldwell]] (1965). He is a major recurring character in the ''Roma Sub Rosa'' series of mystery novels by [[Steven Saylor]]. [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novels [[Imperium (novel)|''Imperium'']] and [[Lustrum (novel)|''Lustrum'']] (''Conspirata'' in the U.S.) are the first two parts of a planned trilogy of novels based upon the life of Cicero. He also appears several times as a peripheral character in [[John Maddox Roberts]]'s ''[[SPQR series|SPQR]]'' series. Roberts's protagonist, [[Decius Metellus]], admires Cicero for his erudition, but is disappointed by his lack of real opposition to Caesar, as well as puzzled by his relentless fawning on the ''Optimates'', who secretly despise Cicero as a parvenu.

He features as a quest-giving character (compare [[cicerone]]) in the 2009 PC game, [[Grand Ages: Rome]].

==Works==
{{Main|Writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero}}
Cicero was declared a “[[righteous pagan]]” by the early [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and therefore many of his works were deemed worthy of preservation. Subsequent Roman writers quoted liberally from his works &quot;[[De re publica]]&quot; (On The Republic) and &quot;[[De Legibus]]&quot; (On The Laws), and much of his work has been recreated from these surviving fragments. Cicero also articulated an early, abstract conceptualization of rights, based on ancient law and custom. Of Cicero's books, six on rhetoric have survived, as well as parts of eight on philosophy. Of his speeches, eighty eight were recorded, but only fifty eight survive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the historical office in Rome and medieval cities as well as during the French Revolution.}}
'''Consul''' (abbrev. ''cos.''; Latin plural ''consules'') was the highest elected office of the [[Roman Republic]] and an appointive office under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. The title was also used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in the [[First French Republic]]. The relating adjective is '''consular''', from the Latin ''consularis'' (which has been used, substantiated, as a title in its own right).

==Ancient Rome==
{{main|Roman consul}}
During the [[Roman Republic]], the consuls were the highest civil and military magistrates, serving as the [[head of government|heads of government]] for the Republic. New consuls were elected every year. There were two consuls and they ruled together by mutual consensus, i.e. only when they agreed with each other could they exercise the authority of their office. However, after the establishment of the Empire, the consuls were merely a figurative representative of Rome’s republican heritage and held very little power and authority, with the emperor acting as the supreme leader.

==Other uses in antiquity==
===Other city states===
While many cities (as in Gaul) had a double-headed chief magistracy, often another title was used, such as ''Duumvir'' or native styles such as ''Meddix'', but ''Consul'' was used in some.

===Private sphere===
It was not uncommon for an organisation under Roman private law to copy the terminology of state and city institutions for its own statutory agents. The founding statute, or contract, of such an organisation was called ''lex'', 'law'. The people elected each year were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], members of the upper class.

==Medieval city states==
The city-state of [[Genoa]], unlike ancient Rome, bestowed the title of ''Consul'' on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities. This institution, with its name, was later emulated by other powers and is reflected in the modern usage of the word (see [[Consul (representative)]]). 

In England, the clerks of [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], made a practice of using the [[Latin]] word ''consul'' rather than the more common ''comes'' when translating his title of '[[Earl]]'. Modern historians sometimes call him &quot;Robert the Consul&quot;, for that reason, though he himself and his contemporaries did not use that name.

==French Revolution==
===French Republic===
{{main|French Consulate}}
After [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in November 1799 [[18 Brumaire|staged a coup]] against the [[French Directory|Directory]] government, the French Republic adopted a [[Constitution of the Year VIII|constitution]], which conferred executive powers upon three Consuls, elected for a period of ten years. In reality, the First Consul, Bonaparte, dominated his two colleagues and held supreme power, soon making himself Consul for life and eventually, in 1804, [[First French Empire|Emperor]].

The office was held by
*[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès]], [[Roger Ducos]], Provisional Consuls (10 November – 12 December 1799)
*[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (First Consul), [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès|Jean-Jacques Cambacérès]] (Second Consul), [[Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Charles-François Lebrun]] (Third Consul), Consuls (12 December 1799 – 18 May 1804)

===Roman Republic===
The French-sponsored [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (15 February 1798 – 23 June 1800) was headed by multiple consuls:
*Francesco Riganti, Carlo Luigi Costantini, Duke Bonelli-Crescenzi, Antonio Bassi, Gioacchino Pessuti, Angelo Stampa, Domenico Maggi, Provisional Consuls (15 February – 20 March 1798)
*Liborio Angelucci, Giacomo De Mattheis, Panazzi, Reppi, [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]], Consuls (20 March – September 1798)
*Brigi, Calisti, Francesco Pierelli, Giuseppe Rey, Federico Maria Domenico Michele, Zaccaleoni, Consuls (September – 24 July 1799)  

''Consular rule was interrupted by the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] occupation (27 November – 12 December 1798), which installed a Provisional Government:
*Prince Giambattista [[Borghese]], Prince Paolo-Maria [[Aldobrandini]], Prince Gibrielli, Marchese Camillo Massimo, Giovanni Ricci (29 November 1798 - 12 December 1798)

''Rome was occupied by France (11 July – 28 September 1799) and again by Naples (30 September 1799 – 23 June 1800), bringing an end to the Roman Republic.''

===Bolognese Republic===
The short-lived [[Bolognese Republic]], proclaimed in 1796 as a [[French client republic]] in the Central Italian city of [[Bologna]], had a government consisting of nine consuls and its head of state was the ''Presidente del Magistrato'', i.e., [[chief magistrate]], a presiding office held for four months by one of the consuls. As noted above, Bologna already had Consuls at some parts of its Medieval history.

==Later modern republics==
===Paraguay===
In between series of juntas (and various other short-lived regimes), the young republic was governed by &quot;consuls of the republic&quot; in power (2 consuls alternating in power every 4 months): 
*12 October 1813 – 12 February 1814  José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco (1st time)
*12 February 1814 – 12 June 1814  Fulgencio Yegros y Franco de Torres
*12 June 1814 – 3 October 1814  José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco (2nd time); he stayed on as &quot;[[Supreme Dictator|supreme dictator]]&quot; 3 October 1814 – 20 September 1840 (from 6 June 1816 styled &quot;perpetual supreme dictator&quot;)

After a few presidents of the Provisional Junta, there were again consuls of the republic, 14 March 1841 – 13 March 1844 (ruling jointly, but occasionally styled &quot;first consul&quot;, &quot;second consul&quot;): Carlos Antonio López Ynsfrán (b. 1792 – d. 1862) + Mariano Roque Alonzo Romero (d. 1853) (the lasts of the aforementioned juntistas, Commandant-General of the Army) 
Thereafter all republican rulers were styled &quot;president&quot;.

===Revolutionary Greece===
Among the many petty local republics that were formed during the first year of the [[Greek Revolution]], prior to the creation of a unified Provisional Government at the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]], were:
*The Consulate of [[Argos]] (from 26 May 1821, under the Senate of the [[Peloponnese]]) had a ''single'' head of state, styled consul, 28 March 1821 – 26 May 1821: Stamatellos Antonopoulos
*The Consulate of East Greece ([[Livadeia]]) (from 15 November 1821, under the [[Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece|Areopagus of East Greece]]) was headed 1 April 1821 – 15 November 1821 by three Consuls: Lambros Nakos, Ioannis Logothetis &amp; Ioannis Filon
''Note: in [[Greek language|Greek]], the term for &quot;consul&quot; is &quot;ypatos&quot;, which translates as &quot;supreme one&quot;, and hence does not necessarily imply a joint office.''

'''Classical mechanics''' is the branch of [[physics]] used to describe the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayer|Sussman|Wisdom|2001|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most familiar of the theories of physics. The concepts it covers, such as [[mass]], [[acceleration]], and [[force]], are commonly used and known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkshire|Kibble|2004|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is based upon a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] with fixed axes, called a frame of reference. The point of [[concurrent lines|concurrency]] of the three axes is known as the origin of the particular space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkshire|Kibble|2004|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical mechanics utilises many [[equation]]s&amp;mdash;as well as other [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts&amp;mdash;which relate various physical quantities to one another. These include [[differential equations]], [[manifold]]s, [[Lie group]]s, and [[ergodic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arnold|1989|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; This page gives a summary of the most important of these.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = {d\mathbf{s} \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;
average velocity = change in distance / change in time

=== Acceleration ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{\mbox{average}} = \frac{\Delta\mathbf{v}}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\mathbf{s}}{dt^2} &lt;/math&gt;

=== [[Momentum]] ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Force ===

:&lt;math&gt; \sum \mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = \frac{d(m\mathbf{v})}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

=== [[Moment of inertia]] ===

For a single [[axis of rotation]]:
The moment of inertia for an object is the sum of the products of the mass element and the square of their distances from the axis of rotation:

&lt;math&gt;I = \sum r_i^2 m_i =\int_M r^2 \mathrm{d} m = \iiint_V r^2 \rho(x,y,z) \mathrm{d} V&lt;/math&gt;

=== [[Angular momentum]] ===

:&lt;math&gt; |L| = mvr \quad\ &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; if '''v''' is perpendicular to '''r'''

Vector form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{I}\, \omega &lt;/math&gt;

(Note: '''I''' can be treated like a vector if it is diagonalized first, but it is actually a 3&amp;times;3 matrix - a [[tensor]] of rank-2)

'''r''' is the radius vector.

=== [[Torque]] ===

:&lt;math&gt; \sum \boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum \boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} \quad &lt;/math&gt;

This one is very limited, more added later. '''α''' = d'''ω'''/dt

=== Precession ===

Omega is called the precession angular speed, and is defined: 

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Omega} = \frac{wr}{I\boldsymbol{\omega}} &lt;/math&gt;

(Note: '''w''' is the weight of the spinning flywheel)

=== Energy ===
for ''m'' as a constant:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E_k = \int \mathbf{F}_{\mbox{net}} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = \int \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{p} = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix} mv^2 - \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix} m{v_0}^2 \quad\ &lt;/math&gt;    

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E_p = mg\Delta h \quad\  \,\!&lt;/math&gt; in field of gravity

=== Central force motion ===

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2}{d\theta^2}\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{r}}\right) + \frac{1}{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{\mu\mathbf{r}^2}{\mathbf{l}^2}\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

=== [[Equations of motion]] (constant acceleration) ===

These equations can be used only when acceleration is constant. If acceleration is not constant then [[calculus]] must be used.

:&lt;math&gt;v = v_0+at \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac {1} {2}(v_0+v) t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = v_0 t + \frac {1} {2} a t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a s \,&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be adapted for angular motion, where angular acceleration is constant:

: &lt;math&gt; \omega _1 = \omega _0 + \alpha t \,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{1}{2}(\omega _0 + \omega _1)t&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \omega _1^2 = \omega _0^2 + 2\alpha\theta&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _1 t - \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Roman government}} 

The '''cursus honorum''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: &quot;course of offices&quot;) was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in both the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. It was designed for men of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank. The cursus honorum comprised a mixture of military and political administration posts. Each office had a minimum age for election. There were minimum intervals between holding successive offices and laws forbade repeating an office.  These rules were altered and flagrantly ignored in the course of the last century of the Republic. For example, [[Gaius Marius]] held [[consulship]]s for five years in a row between 104 BC and 100 BC. Officially presented as opportunities for public service, the offices often became mere opportunities for self-aggrandizement. The reforms of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] required a ten year period between holding another term in the same office.

To have held each office at the youngest possible age (''suo anno,'' &quot;in his year&quot;) was considered a great political success, since to miss out on a praetorship at 39 meant that one could not become consul at 42.  [[Cicero]] expressed extreme pride both in being a ''[[novus homo]]'' (&quot;new man&quot;) who became consul though none of his ancestors had ever served as a consul, and in having become consul &quot;in his year&quot;.

== Military Tribune ==
{{Main|Military tribune}}
{{Disputed-section|date=October 2009}}
The cursus honorum began with ten years of military duty in the Roman cavalry (the ''[[equites]]'') or in the staff of a general who was a relative or a friend of the family. 
The ten years of service were intended to be mandatory in order to qualify for political office, but in practice, the rule was not always rigidly applied.

A more prestigious position was that of a [[tribune|military tribune]]. In the early [[Republic|Roman Republic]], 24 men at the age of around 20 were elected by the [[Roman assemblies|Tribal Assembly]] to serve as a commander in the legions, with six tribunes to each and command rotating among them. Tribunes could also be appointed by the [[Roman consul|consuls]] or by military commanders in the field as necessary. After the reforms of [[Gaius Marius]] in 107 BC, the six tribunes acted as staff officers for the legionary [[Legatus]] and were appointed tasks and command of units of troops whenever the need arose.

The following steps of the ''cursus honorum'' were achieved by direct election every year.

== Quaestor ==
{{Main|quaestor}}
The first official post was that of ''quaestor''. Candidates had to be at least 30 years old. However, men of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] rank could subtract two years from this and other minimum age requirements. Such exemptions, however, either were rarely permitted or removed after the reforms of [[Sulla]], since Julius Caesar had been elected a quaestor after turning 30.   It was rare that a Roman was elected quaestor in his first year of eligibility; such an election would usually boost the official's standing in Rome.

Twenty quaestors served in the financial administration at Rome or as second-in-command to a governor in the provinces. They could also serve as the pay master for a legion. A young man who obtained this job was expected to become a very important official. An additional task of all quaestors was the supervision of public games. Also, after the reforms of Sulla in the early 80s BC, election to quaestor brought automatic membership in the Senate, which previously was decided by the censors. As a quaestor, an official was allowed to wear the [[toga|toga praetexta]], but was not escorted by [[lictor]]s, nor did he possess [[imperium]].

== Aediles ==

{{Main|Aedile}}

At 36 years of age, former quaestors could stand for election to one of the ''aedile'' positions. Of these aediles, two were plebeian and two were patrician, with the patrician aediles called Curule Aediles.  The plebeian aediles were elected by the [[Plebeian Council]] and the curule aediles were either elected by the [[Roman assemblies|Tribal Assembly]] or appointed by the reigning consul. The aediles had administrative responsibilities in Rome. They had to take care of the temples (whence their title, from the Latin ''[[Aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', &quot;[[Roman temple|temple]]&quot;) they organized games and were responsible for the maintenance of the public buildings in Rome. Moreover, they took charge of Rome's water and food supplies; in their capacity as market superintendents, they served sometimes as judges in mercantile affairs. 

The Aedile was the supervisor of public works; the words &quot;edifice&quot; and &quot;edification&quot; stem from the title. He oversaw the public works, temples and markets. Therefore the Aediles would have been in some cooperation with the current Censors, who had similar or related duties. Also they oversaw the organization of festivals and games (''ludi''), which made this a very sought after office for a career minded politician of the late republic, as it was a good means of gaining popularity by staging spectacles. 

Curule Aediles were added at a later date in the 4th century BCE, and their duties do not differ substantially from plebeian aediles.  However, unlike plebeian aediles, curule aediles were allowed certain symbols of rank—the ''[[Curule chair|sella curulis]]'' or 'curule chair,' for example—and only patricians could stand for election to curule aedile. This later changed, and both Plebeians and Patricians could stand for Curule Aedileship. 

The elections for Curule Aedile were at first alternated between Patricians and Plebeians, until late in the 2nd century BC the practice was abandoned and both classes became free to run during all years. 

While part of the ''cursus honorum'', this step was optional and not required to hold future offices. Though the office was usually held after the [[quaestor]]ship and before the [[praetor]]ship, there are some cases with former praetors serving as aediles.

== Praetor ==

{{Main|Praetor}}

After holding either the office of quaestor or aedile, a man of 39 years  could run for ''praetor''. The number of Praetors elected varied through history, generally increasing with time.  During the republic, six or eight were generally elected each year to serve judicial functions throughout Rome and other governmental responsibilities. In the absence of the Consuls, a Praetor would be given command of the garrison in Rome or in Italy. Also, a Praetor could exercise the functions of the Consuls throughout Rome, but their main function was that of a judge. They would preside over trials involving criminal acts as well as grant court orders or validate &quot;illegal&quot; acts as acts of administering justice.  As a Praetor, a magistrate was escorted by six lictors, and owned imperium. After a term as Praetor, the magistrate would serve as a provincial governor in the office of Propraetor, owning Propraetor imperium, commanding the province’s legions, and possessing ultimate authority within his province(s).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;Jo-Ann Shelton, As the Romans did: a sourcebook in Roman Social History. Second edition. pages 207-215&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the Praetors, two were more prestigious than the others. The first was the Praetor Peregrinus, who was the chief judge in trials involving one or more foreigners. The other was the Praetor Urbanus, the chief judicial office in Rome. He had the power to overturn any verdict by any other courts, and served as judge in cases involving criminal charges against provincial governors. The Praetor Urbanus was not allowed to leave the city for more than ten days. If one of these two Praetors was absent from Rome, the other would perform the duties of both.

== Consul ==

{{Main|Consul}}

The office of ''consul'' was the most prestigious of all, and represented the summit of a successful career. The minimum age was 42 for plebeians and 40 for patricians. Years were identified by the names of the two consuls elected&lt;ref&gt;That is, a [[suffect consul]] did not give his name to the year.&lt;/ref&gt; for a particular year; for instance, ''M. Messalla et M. Pisone consulibus'', &quot;in the consulship of [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Niger|Messalla]] and [[Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus|Piso]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' 1.2.1. On the translation of the [[ablative absolute]] to define time or circumstances, specifically in designating consular years, see ''Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar'' (New York, 1975 revision), section 419a, p. 263, and Hale and Buck, ''A Latin Grammar'' (University of Alabama Press, 1903, 1988 printing), section 421, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; dates an event to 61 BC. Consuls were responsible for the city's political agenda, commanded large-scale armies and controlled important provinces. The consuls served for only a year (a restriction intended to limit the amassing of power by individuals) and could only rule when they agreed, because each consul could [[veto]] the other's decision. 

The consuls would alternate monthly as the chairman of the Senate. They also were the supreme commanders in the Roman army, with each being granted two legions during their consular year. Consuls also exercised the highest juridical power in the Republic, being the only office with the power to override the decisions of the Praetor Urbanus. Only laws and the decrees of the Senate or the People's assembly limited their powers, and only the veto of a fellow consul or a tribune of the plebs could supersede their decisions. 

A consul was escorted by twelve lictors, owned imperium and wore the toga praetexta. Because the consul was the highest executive office within the Republic, they had the power to veto any action or proposal by any other magistrate, save that of the Tribune of the Plebs. After a consulship, a consul was assigned one of the more important provinces and acted as the governor in the same way that a [[Propraetor]] did, only owning Proconsular imperium. A second consulship could only be attempted after an interval of 10 years to prevent one man holding too much power.

== Governor ==

{{Main|Roman Governor}}

Though not part of the Cursus Honorum, upon completing a term as either Praetor or Consul, an officer was required to serve a term as Propraetor and Proconsul, respectively, in one of Rome's many [[Roman province|provinces]]. These Propraetors and Proconsuls held near autocratic authority within their selected province or provinces. Because each governor held equal imperium to the equivalent magistrate, they were escorted by the same number of lictors (12) and could only be vetoed by a reigning Consul or Praetor. Their abilities to govern were only limited by the decrees of the Senate or the [[Roman assemblies|people's assemblies]], and the [[Tribune|Tribune of the Plebs]] was unable to veto their acts as long as the governor remained at least a mile outside of Rome.

== Censor ==

{{Main|Censor (ancient Rome)}}

After a term as consul, the final step in the Cursus Honorum was the office of ''censor''. This was the only office in the Roman Republic whose term was a period of eighteen months instead of the usual twelve. Censors were elected every five years and although the office held no military imperium, it was considered a great honour. The censors took a regular census of the people and then apportioned the citizens into voting classes on the basis of income and tribal affiliation. The censors enrolled new citizens in tribes and voting classes as well. The censors were also in charge of the membership roll of the Senate, every five years adding new senators who had been elected to the requisite offices. Censors could also remove unworthy members from the Senate. This ability was lost during the dictatorship of Sulla. Censors were also responsible for construction of public buildings and the moral status of the city.

Censors also had financial duties, in that they had to put out to tender projects that were to be financed by the state. Also, the censors were in charge of the leasing out of conquered land for public use and auction. Though this office owned no imperium, meaning no lictors for protection, they were allowed to wear the toga praetexta.

== Tribune of the Plebs ==

{{Main|Tribune of the Plebs}} 

The office of [[Tribune|Tribune of the Plebs]] was an important step in the political career of [[plebeians]]. The Tribune was an office first created to protect the right of the common man in Roman politics and served as the head of the [[Plebeian Council]]. In the mid to late Republic, however, plebeians were often just as, and sometimes more, wealthy and powerful than patricians. Those who held the office were granted [[sacrosanctity]] (the right to be legally protected from any physical harm), the power to rescue any plebeian from the hands of a patrician magistrate, and the right to veto any act or proposal of any magistrate, including another tribune of the people and the consuls. The tribune also had the power to exercise capital punishment against any person who interfered in the performance of his duties. The tribunes could even convene a Senate meeting and lay legislation before it and arrest magistrates. Their houses had to remain open for visitors even during the night, and they were not allowed to be more than a day's journey from Rome. Due to their unique power of sacrosanctity, the Tribune had no need for lictors for protection and owned no imperium, nor could they wear the toga praetexta.

== Princeps senatus ==

{{Main|Princeps senatus}}

Another office not officially a step in the ''cursus honorum'' was the ''princeps senatus'', an extremely prestigious office for a patrician. The ''princeps senatus'' served as the leader of the Senate and was chosen to serve a five year term by each pair of Censors every five years. Censors could, however, confirm a ''princeps senatus'' for a period of another five years. The ''princeps senatus'' was chosen from all Patricians who had served as a Consul, with former Censors usually holding the office.  The office originally granted the holder the ability to speak first at session on the topic presented by the presiding magistrate, but eventually gained the power to open and close the senate sessions, decide the agenda, decide where the session should take place, impose order and other rules of the session, meet in the name of the senate with embassies of foreign countries, and write in the name of the senate letters and dispatches. This office, like the Tribune, did not own ''imperium'', was not escorted by lictors, and could not wear the ''toga praetexta''.

== Dictator and Magister Equitum ==

{{Main|Roman Dictator|Magister Equitum}}

Of all the offices within the Roman Republic, none granted as much power and authority as the position of ''dictator'', known as the Master of the People. In times of emergencies, the Senate would declare that a dictator was required, and the current consuls would appoint a dictator. This was the only decision that could not be vetoed by the Tribune of the Plebs. The dictator was the sole exception to the Roman legal principles of having multiple magistrates in the same office and being legally able to be held to answer for actions in office. There could never be more than one dictator at any one time for any reason, and no dictator could ever be held legally responsible for any action during his time in office for any reason. 

The dictator was the highest magistrate in degree of imperium and was attended by twenty-four lictors (like the Kings of Rome). Though his term lasted only six months instead of twelve (except for the Dictatorships of Sulla and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]), all other magistrates reported to the dictator (except for the tribunes of the plebs - although they could not veto any of the dictator's acts), granting the dictator absolute authority in both civil and military matters throughout the Republic. The Dictator was free from the control of the Senate in all that he did, could execute anyone without a trial for any reason, and could ignore any law in the performance of his duties. The Dictator was the sole magistrate under the Republic that was truly independent in discharging his duties. All of the other offices were extensions of the Senate's executive authority and thus answerable to the Senate. Since the Dictator exercised his own authority, he did not suffer this limitation, which was the cornerstone of the office's power.

When a Dictator entered office, he appointed to serve as his second-in-command a ''magister equitum'', the Master of the Horse, whose office ceased to exist once the Dictator left office. The magister equitum held Praetorian imperium, was attended by six lictors, and was charged with assisting the Dictator in managing the State. When the Dictator was away from Rome, the magister equitum usually remained behind to administer the city. The magister equitum, like the Dictator, had unchallengeable authority in all civil and military affairs, with his decisions only being overturned by the Dictator himself.

The Dictatorship was definitively abolished in 44BC after the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar.

'''Continental drift''' is the movement of the [[Earth]]'s [[continents]] relative to each other. The hypothesis that continents 'drift' was first put forward by [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1596 and was fully developed by [[Alfred Wegener]] in 1912. However, it was not until the development of the theory of [[plate tectonics]] in the 1960s, that a sufficient [[geology|geological]] explanation of that movement was found.

===Early history===
[[Abraham Ortelius]]  {{Harv|Ortelius|1596}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Romm |first=James |title=A New Forerunner for Continental Drift |journal=Nature |date=February 3, 1994 |volume=367 |pages=407–408 |doi=10.1038/367407a0 |postscript=. |issue=6462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodor Christoph Lilienthal (1756),&lt;ref name=schmeling2004 &gt;{{Cite web |first=Harro |last=Schmeling |url=http://www.geophysik.uni-frankfurt.de/~schmelin/skripte/Geodynn1-kap1-2-S1-S22-2004.pdf |title=Geodynamik |year=2004 |publisher=Univesity of Frankfurt |language=german }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1801 and 1845),&lt;ref name=schmeling2004 /&gt; [[Antonio Snider-Pellegrini]] {{Harv|Snider-Pellegrini|1858}}, and others had noted earlier that the shapes of [[continent]]s on opposite sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (most notably, Africa and South America) seem to fit together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/crerar/crerar-prize/2003%2004%20Brusatte.pdf |title=Continents Adrift and Sea-Floors Spreading: The Revolution of Plate Tectonics |first=Stephen |last=Brusatte}}&lt;/ref&gt; W. J. Kious described Ortelius' thoughts in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kious |first=W.J. |coauthors=Tilling, R.I. |title=This Dynamic Earth: the Story of Plate Tectonics |origyear=1996 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/dynamic.html |accessdate=2008-01-29 |edition=Online |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |isbn=0160482208 |chapter=Historical perspective |chapterurl=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/historical.html |year=2001 |month=February}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Abraham Ortelius in his work Thesaurus Geographicus ... suggested that the Americas were &quot;torn away from Europe and Africa ... by earthquakes and floods&quot; and went on to say: &quot;The vestiges of the rupture reveal themselves, if someone brings forward a map of the world and considers carefully the coasts of the three [continents].&quot;}}

=== Wegener and his predecessors ===
The hypothesis that the continents had once formed [[Pangea|a single landmass]] before breaking apart and drifting to their present locations was fully formulated by [[Alfred Wegener]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=weg&gt;{{Citation
 |last=  Wegener|first= Alfred |coauthors=  |date= 6 January 1912 |title= Die Herausbildung der Grossformen der Erdrinde (Kontinente und Ozeane), auf geophysikalischer Grundlage |journal= Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen |volume= 63 |issue=  |pages= 185–195, 253–256, 305–309 |url= http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch2005_1_3.pdf |accessdate=  |doi =
 |postscript=  . }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Wegener's theory was formed independently and was more complete than those of his predecessors, Wegener later credited a number of past authors with similar ideas:&lt;ref name=wegb&gt;{{Citation  | author=Wegener, A. | title = The Origin of Continents and Oceans | year=1929/1966 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0486617084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Wegener, A. | title = [[:s:de:Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane|Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane]]|edition= 4 | year=1929 |publisher=Friedrich Vieweg &amp; Sohn Akt. Ges.| place=Braunschweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Franklin Coxworthy (between 1848 and 1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Coxworthy, F.| title = [http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/cgi-bin/udlcgi/ulibreader_iisc/bookReader.cgi?barcode=99999991946789&amp;format=ptiff&amp;curPage=1 Electrical Condition or How and Where our Earth was created] | place=London | publisher=W. J. S. Phillips| year=1848/1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Roberto Mantovani]] (between 1889 and 1909), [[William Henry Pickering]] (1907)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Pickering, W.H| title = [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1907PA.....15..274P The Place of Origin of the Moon - The Volcani Problems] | journal= Popular Astronomy | pages=274–287| year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Frank Bursley Taylor]] (1908).

For example: the similarity of southern continent geological formations had led [[Roberto Mantovani]] to conjecture in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had once been joined into a [[supercontinent]] (now known as [[Pangaea]]); Wegener noted the similarity of Mantovani's and his own maps of the former positions of the southern continents. Through [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity due to [[thermal expansion]] this continent broke and the new continents drifted away from each other because of further expansion of the rip-zones, where the oceans now lie. This led Mantovani to propose an [[Expanding Earth theory]] which has since been shown to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Mantovani, R.| author-link =| title = Les fractures de l’écorce terrestre et la théorie de Laplace | journal= Bull. Soc. Sc. Et Arts Réunion | pages=41–53| year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Mantovani, R.| title = L’Antarctide |journal= Je m’instruis.

Hilgenberg | year=2003  | place=Rome | publisher= Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia |pages= 71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sort of continental drift without expansion was proposed by [[Frank Bursley Taylor]], who suggested in 1908 (published in 1910) that the continents were dragged towards the equator by increased lunar gravity during the [[Cretaceous]], thus forming the Himalayas and Alps on the southern faces. Wegener said that of all those theories, Taylor's, although not fully developed, had the most similarities to his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Taylor, F.B. | title = [http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1130%2F1052-5173(2005)015%5B29b%3AWTCCA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 Bearing of the tertiary mountain belt on the origin of the earth's plan] | journal= GSA Bulletin | volume=21 |issue=2| pages=179–226| year=1910  | doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2005)015[29b:WTCCA]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wegener was the first to use the phrase &quot;continental drift&quot; (1912, 1915)&lt;ref name=weg /&gt;&lt;ref name=wegb /&gt; (in German &quot;die Verschiebung der Kontinente&quot; – translated into English in 1922) and formally publish the hypothesis that the continents had somehow &quot;drifted&quot; apart. Although he presented much evidence for continental drift, he was unable to provide a convincing explanation for the physical processes which might have caused this drift. His suggestion that the continents had been pulled apart by the [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal pseudoforce]] (''Polflucht'') of the Earth's rotation or by a small component of astronomical [[precession]] was rejected as calculations showed that the force was not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/techist.html |title=Plate Tectonics: The Rocky History of an Idea |quote=Wegener's inability to provide an adequate explanation of the forces responsible for continental drift and the prevailing belief that the earth was solid and immovable resulted in the scientific dismissal of his theories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polflucht]] hypothesis was also studied by [[Paul Sophus Epstein]] in 1920 and found to be implausible.

==Evidence that continents 'drift'==

[[File:Snider-Pellegrini Wegener fossil map.gif|thumb|right|Fossil patterns across continents ([[Gondwanaland]]).]]
[[Image:Mesosaurus.png|right|thumb|''Mesosaurus'' skeleton, MacGregor, 1908.]]
{{Details|Plate tectonics}}&lt;!-- 
''Note: This section contains evidence available to Wegener's contemporaries and predecessors'' --&gt;

Evidence for continental drift is now extensive. Similar plant and animal [[fossil]]s are found around different continent shores, suggesting that they were once joined. The fossils of [[Mesosaurus]], a freshwater reptile rather like a small crocodile, found both in [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]], are one example; another is the discovery of fossils of the land [[reptile]] ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' from [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s of the same age from locations in [[South America]], [[Africa]], and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/continents.html |publisher=USGS |title=Rejoined continents [This Dynamic Earth, USGS] }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also living evidence — the same animals being found on two continents. Some [[earthworm]] families (e.g.: Ocnerodrilidae, Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae) are found in South America and Africa, for instance.

The complementary arrangement of the facing sides of South America and Africa is obvious, but is a temporary coincidence.  In millions of years, [[slab pull]] and [[ridge-push]], and other forces of [[tectonophysics]] will further separate and rotate those two continents.  It was this temporary feature which inspired Wegener to study what he defined as continental drift, although he did not live to see his hypothesis become generally accepted.

Widespread distribution of [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift.  The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, in modern coordinates, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations, as well as contiguous with each other.&lt;ref name=wegb /&gt;

==Rejection of Wegener's theory, and subsequent vindication==
While it is now accepted that the continents do move across the Earth's surface &amp;ndash; though more in a driven mode than the aimlessness suggested by &quot;drift&quot; &amp;ndash; as a ''theory'', continental drift was not accepted for many years. One problem was that a plausible driving force was missing. And it did not help that Wegener was not a geologist.  

The British geologist [[Arthur Holmes]] championed the theory of continental drift at a time when it was deeply unfashionable. He proposed that the Earth's mantle contained convection cells that dissipated radioactive heat and moved the crust at the surface. His ''Principles of Physical Geology'', ending with a chapter on continental drift, was published in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Holmes |first=Arthur |title=Principles of Physical Geology |edition=1 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons |year=1944 |isbn=0174480202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1953 &amp;ndash; just five years before [[Samuel Warren Carey|Carey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 |last1=Carey |first1=S. W. |year=1958 |contribution=The tectonic approach to continental drift |editor1-last=Carey |editor1-first=S. W. |title=Continental Drift&amp;mdash;A symposium |publisher=Univ. of Tasmania |place=Hobart |pages=177–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the theory of [[plate tectonics]] &amp;ndash; the theory of continental drift was rejected by the physicist Scheiddiger on the following grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Scheidegger|first= |title= Examination of the physics of theories of orogenesis|journal= GSA Bulletin|year= 1953|volume= 64|pages= 127–150|doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1953)64[127:EOTPOT]2.0.CO;2|first1= Adrian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* First, it had been shown that floating masses on a rotating geoid would collect at the equator, and stay there.  This would explain one, but only one, mountain building episode between any pair of continents; it failed to account for earlier orogenic episodes.
* Second, masses floating freely in a fluid substratum, like icebergs in the ocean, should be in [[isostatic]] equilibrium (where the forces of gravity and buoyancy are in balance).  Gravitational measurements were showing that many areas are not in isostatic equilibrium.
* Third, there was the problem of why some parts of the Earth's surface (crust) should have solidifed while other parts were still fluid. Various attempts to explain this foundered on other difficulties.

Geophysicist [[Jack Oliver (scientist)|Jack Oliver]] is credited with providing seismologic evidence supporting plate tectonics which encompassed and superseded continental drift with “Seismology and the New Global Tectonics,” published in 1968, using data collected from seismologic stations, including those he set up in the South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/science/earth/12oliver.html?ref=science Jack Oliver, Who Proved Continental Drift, Dies at 87, New York Times on-line, January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now known that there are two kinds of crust, [[continental crust]] and [[oceanic crust]].  Continental crust is inherently lighter  and of a different composition to oceanic crust, but both kinds reside above a much deeper fluid mantle.  Oceanic crust is created at [[Seafloor spreading|spreading centers]], and this, along with [[subduction]], drives the system of plates in a chaotic manner, resulting in continuous [[orogeny]] and areas of isostatic imbalance. The theory of [[plate tectonics]] explains all this, including the movement of the continents, better than Wegener's theory.

The '''Commodores''' is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]]/[[soul music|soul]] [[band (music)|band]] of the 1970s and 1980s. The members of the group met as mostly [[freshmen]] at Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]) in 1968, and signed with [[Motown]] in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for [[The Jackson 5]] while on [[concert tour|tour]]. The Commodores have sold over 75 million records worldwide.

==Biography==
This group is best known for their [[ballad]]s, such as &quot;[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]&quot; and &quot;[[Three Times a Lady]]&quot;, but, for the most part, the group mainly recorded [[funk]]y, driven dance-floor [[hit record|hit]]s which include &quot;[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]&quot;, &quot;Say Yeah&quot;, &quot;Fancy Dancer&quot;, and &quot;Too Hot ta Trot&quot;. The Commodores originally called themselves the Mystics, but wanted to change the name. To choose a new name [[William King]] opened a dictionary and randomly picked a word. &quot;We lucked out,&quot; he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to ''[[People (magazine)]]''. &quot;We almost became The Commodes!&quot;

&quot;[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]&quot;, the [[instrumental]] title track from the band's debut album, became a staple at [[United States|American]] sporting events, and is similarly featured in many films, including ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]''. It reached #24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. Another instrumental, &quot;[[Cebu]]&quot; (named after an [[Cebu Province|island]] in the [[Philippines]]), later became a staple in the [[Quiet storm]] format. Three albums released in years 1975 and 1976 (''[[Caught in the Act (Commodores album)|Caught in the Act]]'', ''[[Movin' On (Commodores album)|Movin' On]]'', ''[[Hot On The Tracks]]'') are considered the peak of their harder funk period. Only one such hit from that era scored big, the funk-driven &quot;Brick House&quot; which reached #5 in the U.S. After those recordings the group started to move towards softer sound. That move was hinted from their 1976 Top Ten hits &quot;Sweet Love&quot; and &quot;[[Just to Be Close to You]].&quot; In 1977 the Commodores scored a ballad hit with &quot;[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]&quot;, which became the group's biggest hit yet, reaching #4 in the U.S. After years of toiling in the Top Ten, the group finally reached #1 in 1978 with the sweet &quot;[[Three Times a Lady]].&quot; 1979 saw the Commodores score another Top Five ballad hit &quot;Sail On&quot; before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad, &quot;[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]].&quot; The group had no major hits in 1980, but by 1981 they were back with a vengeance, scoring Top Ten hits with the ballad &quot;[[Oh No]]&quot; (#4 U.S.) and their first upbeat single in almost five years, &quot;Lady (You Bring Me Up)&quot; (#8 U.S.).

In Tuskegee, they played local parties and fraternity parties playing mostly cover tunes and some original songs with their original singer, James Ingram (another &quot;James Ingram&quot; - not the more famous solo artist Ingram). Ingram, older than the rest of the members of the band, left to serve active duty in Vietnam, and was later replaced by Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Orange, the second lead singer who wrote or co-wrote many of their hit tunes before [[Lionel Richie]] came on board. Lionel and Clyde alternated as lead singers. Clyde was also the lead singer on the Top 10 hits,&quot;[[Nightshift]]&quot; and &quot;Brick House&quot; among others.

After Richie left to pursue a [[solo (music)|solo]] career, former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] [[singer]] [[J.D. Nicholas]] assumed co-lead vocal duties with [[drummer]] Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Orange. However, with the exception of the Grammy-winning &quot;[[Nightshift]]&quot; (#3 in the U.S., a tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Jackie Wilson]]; recently re-recorded a version dedicated to [[Michael Jackson]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&amp;catid=85:latest-news&amp;Itemid=82 Commodores Re-record &quot;Nightshift&quot; As MJ Tribute]&lt;/ref&gt;), the band never achieved the same level of success it had enjoyed with Richie. Ironically, &quot;Nightshift&quot; won The Commodores their first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in 1985.

The Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film ''[[Thank God It's Friday]]''. They performed the song &quot;Too Hot ta Trot&quot; during the dance contest; their songs &quot;Brick House&quot; and &quot;Easy&quot; were also played during the movie.

[[File:CommodoresPerformingUpClose.jpg|thumb|right|Performing at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Florida]]

Over time, the group's founding members began leaving. McClary left in 1982 (shortly after Richie left) to pursue a solo career and to develop a [[gospel music]] company. McClary was replaced by guitarist/vocalist [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]]. LaPread left in 1986 and moved to [[New Zealand]], and Reynolds departed for [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] in 1987, which prompted [[trumpeter]] William &quot;WAK&quot; King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances. Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989. The group also gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial [[pop music|pop]] arena. In 1983, [[Skyler Jett]], replaced Lionel Richie as the lead singer for The Commodores, and toured the world and performed in over 32 countries in a two year span.

In 1985, the group performed two [[advertising|commercial]]s for [[NBC]] affiliate [[WXIA]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The group left Motown in 1986 for [[Polydor]], and released several additional [[album]]s, which are primarily [[compilation album|compilations]] of previous material. They have re-recorded Commodores hits and have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a [[live album]] and a Christmas album.

Today, the Commodores consist of Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Orange, James Dean &quot;J.D.&quot; Nicholas and [[William &quot;WAK&quot; King]], along with a backing band. King married songwriter Shirley Hanna-King (&quot;Brick House&quot; co-writer) in 1976.

Since the late 1990s, Orange has also been working in conjunction with singer/songwriter Craig Deanto, and they have released an album titled &quot;Who Hears the Cries&quot;. The group continues to perform, selling out arenas, theaters and festivals around the world, annually. They have the opening act for Trump [[casino]]s and [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock]] casinos.

'''Collagen''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkɒlədʒən}}) is a group of naturally occurring [[protein]]s found, in nature, exclusively in [[animal]]s, especially in the flesh and [[connective tissue]]s of [[mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Müller |first=Werner E. G. |title=The Origin of Metazoan Complexity: Porifera as Integrated Animals |journal=Integrated Computational Biology |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2003 |doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the main component of connective tissue, and is the most abundant protein in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Gloria A. |last=Di Lullo |first2=Shawn M. |last2=Sweeney |first3=Jarmo |last3=Körkkö |first4=Leena |last4=Ala-Kokko |lastauthoramp=yes |first5=James D. |last5=San Antonio |title=Mapping the Ligand-binding Sites and Disease-associated Mutations on the Most Abundant Protein in the Human, Type I Collagen |journal=[[Journal of Biological Chemistry|J.

Collagen, in the form of elongated [[fibril]]s, is mostly found in [[Fibrous connective tissue|fibrous tissues]] such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc.

In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the [[endomysium]]. Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sikorski |first=Zdzisław E. |year=2001 |title=Chemical and Functional Properties of Food Proteins |location=Boca Raton |publisher=CRC Press |page=242 |isbn=1566769604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gelatin]], which is used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly [[hydrolyzed]].

==History and background==
The molecular and packing structures of collagen have eluded scientists over decades of research.  The first evidence that it possesses a regular structure at the molecular level was presented in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wyckoff |first=R. |first2=R. |last2=Corey |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=J. |last3=Biscoe |title=X-ray reflections of long spacing from tendon |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=1935 |volume=82 |pmid=17810172 |issue=2121 |pages=175–176 |doi=10.1126/science.82.2121.175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clark |first=G. |last2=Parker |first2=E. |last3=Schaad |first3=J. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Warren |first4=W.

Berman|Berman]], and [[Gopalasamudram Narayana Iyer Ramachandran|Ramachandran]], concentrated on the conformation of the collagen [[monomer]]. Several competing models, although correctly dealing with the conformation of each individual peptide chain, gave way to the triple-helical &quot;Madras&quot; model, which provided an essentially correct model of the molecule's [[quaternary structure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Oct2001/Oct2001p2-5.html |title=GNR — A Tribute - Resonance - October 2001 |date= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leonidas |first=Demetres D. |last2=''et al.'' |year=2001 |first2=GB |last3=Jardine |first3=AM |last4=Li |first4=S |last5=Shapiro |first5=R |last6=Acharya |first6=KR |title=Binding of Phosphate and pyrophosphate ions at the active site of human angiogenin as revealed by X-ray crystallography |journal=Protein Science |pmid=11468363 |volume=10 |issue=8 |pmc=2374093 |pages=1669–1676 |doi=10.1110/ps.13601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Subramanian |first=Easwara |year=2001 |title=Obituary: G.N.

==Molecular structure==
The tropocollagen or collagen molecule is a subunit of larger collagen aggregates such as fibrils. At approximately 300&amp;nbsp;nm long and 1.5&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter, it is made up of three [[polypeptide]] strands (called alpha chains), each possessing the conformation of a left-handed [[helix]] (its name is not to be confused with the commonly occurring alpha helix, a right-handed structure). These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed [[coiled coil]], a triple helix or &quot;super helix&quot;, a cooperative [[quaternary structure]] stabilized by numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril. Each microfibril is interdigitated with its neighboring microfibrils to a degree that might suggest they are individually unstable, although within collagen fibrils, they are so well ordered as to be crystalline.

A distinctive feature of collagen is the regular arrangement of [[amino acid]]s in each of the three chains of these collagen subunits. The sequence often follows the pattern [[glycine|Gly]]-[[proline|Pro]]-X or Gly-X-[[hydroxyproline|Hyp]], where X  may be any of various other amino acid residues. Proline or hydroxyproline constitute about 1/6 of the total sequence. With glycine accounting for the 1/3 of the sequence, this means approximately half of the collagen sequence is not glycine, proline or hydroxyproline, a fact often missed due to the distraction of the unusual GX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; character of collagen alpha-peptides. This kind of regular repetition and high glycine content is found in only a few other fibrous proteins, such as [[silk]] [[fibroin]]. About 75-80% of silk is (approximately) -Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala- with 10% [[serine]], and [[elastin]] is rich in glycine, proline, and alanine (Ala), whose [[side chain|side group]] is a small, inert [[methyl]] group. Such high glycine and regular repetitions are never found in globular proteins save for very short sections of their sequence. [[Chemical reaction|Chemically-reactive]] side groups are not needed in structural proteins, as they are in enzymes and [[transport protein]]s; however, collagen is not quite just a structural protein. Due to its key role in the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation and infrastructure, many sections of its nonproline-rich regions have cell or matrix association / regulation roles. The relatively high content of proline and hydroxyproline rings, with their geometrically constrained [[carboxyl]] and (secondary) [[amino]] groups, along with the rich abundance of glycine, accounts for the tendency of the individual polypeptide strands to form left-handed helices spontaneously, without any intrachain hydrogen bonding.

Because glycine is the smallest amino acid with no side chain, it plays a unique role in fibrous structural proteins. In collagen, Gly is required at every third position because the assembly of the triple helix puts this residue at the interior (axis) of the helix, where there is no space for a larger side group than glycine’s single [[hydrogen|hydrogen atom]]. For the same reason, the rings of the Pro and Hyp must point outward. These two amino acids help stabilize the triple helix—Hyp even more so than Pro; a lower concentration of them is required in animals such as [[fish]], whose [[thermoregulation|body temperatures]] are lower than most warm-blooded animals.

==Fibrillar structure==

The tropocollagen [[protein subunit|subunits]] spontaneously [[molecular self-assembly|self-assemble]], with regularly staggered ends, into even larger arrays in the [[extracellular]] spaces of tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hulmes |first=D.

Each D-period contains four plus a fraction collagen molecules, because 300&amp;nbsp;nm divided by 67&amp;nbsp;nm does not give an integer (the length of the collagen molecule divided by the stagger distance D). Therefore, in each D-period repeat of the microfibril, there is a part containing five molecules in cross-section, called the “overlap”, and a part containing only four molecules, called the &quot;gap&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orgel&quot; /&gt; The triple-helices are also arranged in a hexagonal or quasihexagonal array in cross-section, in both the gap and overlap regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hulmes Miller 1979&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orgel&quot; /&gt;

Collagen fibrils are semicrystalline aggregates of collagen molecules. Collagen fibers are bundles of fibrils.

Collagen fibrils/aggregates are arranged in different combinations and concentrations in various tissues to provide varying tissue properties. In bone, entire collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array. Forty nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits (approximately equal to the gap region) probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of long, hard, fine crystals of the mineral component, which is (approximately) [[hydroxylapatite|hydroxyapatite]], Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with some [[phosphate]]. It is in this way that certain kinds of cartilage turn into bone. Type I collagen gives bone its tensile strength.

==Types and associated disorders==
Collagen occurs in many places throughout the body. So far, only 29 types of collagen have been identified and described.  Over 90% of the collagen in the body, however, is of type I&lt;ref&gt;Sabiston textbook of surgery board review, 7th edition. Chapter 5 wound healing, question 14&lt;/ref&gt;

*Collagen One: skin, tendon, vascular, ligature, organs, bone (main component of bone)
*Collagen Two: cartilage (main component of cartilage)
*Collagen Three: reticulate (main component of reticular fibers), commonly found alongside type I.
*Collagen Four: forms bases of cell basement membrane
*Collagen Five: cells surfaces, hair and placenta

Collagen-related diseases most commonly arise from genetic defects or nutritional deficiencies that affect the biosynthesis, assembly, postranslational modification, secretion, or other processes involved in normal collagen production.

|}

In addition to the above mentioned disorders, excessive deposition of collagen occurs in [[scleroderma]].

==Staining==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}

In [[histology]], collagen is brightly eosinophilic (pink) in standard [[H&amp;E stain|H&amp;E]] slides.  The [[dye]] [[methyl violet]] may be used to [[staining (biology)|stain]] the collagen in tissue samples.

The dye [[methyl blue]] can also be used to stain collagen and [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] stains are available if required.

The best stain for use in differentiating collagen from other fibers is [[Masson's trichrome]] stain.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Tropocollagen cross-linkage lysyl oxidase (EN).svg|thumb|Action of [[lysyl oxidase]]]]

===Amino acids===
Collagen has an unusual [[amino acid]] composition and sequence:
* [[Glycine]] (Gly) is found at almost every third [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]
* [[Proline]] (Pro) makes up about 17% of collagen
* Collagen contains two uncommon derivative amino acids not directly inserted during [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. These amino acids are found at specific locations relative to glycine and are modified post-translationally by different enzymes, both of which require [[vitamin C]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].
** [[Hydroxyproline]] (Hyp), derived from proline.
** [[Hydroxylysine]] (Hyl), derived from [[lysine]] (Lys). Depending on the type of collagen, varying numbers of hydroxylysines are [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] (mostly having [[disaccharide]]s attached).

[[Cortisol]] stimulates [[hydrolysis#Hydrolysis of amide links|degradation]] of (skin) collagen into amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Houck |first=J. C. |last2=Sharma |first2=V.

===Collagen I formation===
Most collagen forms in a similar manner, but the following process is typical for type I:

#Inside the cell
##Two types of [[peptide]] chains are formed during [[translation (genetics)|translation]] on ribosomes along the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER): alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains. These peptide chains (known as [[preprocollagen]]) have [[registration peptide]]s on each end and a [[signal peptide]].
##Polypeptide chains are released into the lumen of the RER.
##Signal peptides are cleaved inside the RER and the chains are now known as pro-alpha chains.
##[[Hydroxylation]] of [[lysine]] and [[proline]] amino acids occurs inside the lumen. This process is dependent on [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].
##[[Glycosylation]] of specific hydroxylysine residues occurs.
##Triple helical structure is formed inside the endoplasmic reticulum from each two alpha-1 chains and one alpha-2 chain.
##[[Procollagen]] is shipped to the [[golgi apparatus]], where it is packaged and secreted by [[exocytosis]].
#Outside the cell
##Registration peptides are cleaved and tropocollagen is formed by [[procollagen peptidase]].
##Multiple tropocollagen molecules form [[collagen fibril]]s, via covalent cross-linking ([[aldol reaction]]) by [[lysyl oxidase]] which links hydroxylysine and lysine residues. Multiple collagen fibrils form into [[collagen fiber]]s.
##Collagen may be attached to cell membranes via several types of protein, including [[fibronectin]] and [[integrin]].

===Synthetic pathogenesis===
Vitamin C deficiency causes [[scurvy]], a serious and painful [[disease]] in which defective collagen prevents the formation of strong [[connective tissue]]. [[Gingiva|Gums]] deteriorate and bleed, with loss of teeth; skin discolors, and [[wound]]s do not heal.  Prior to the eighteenth century, this condition was notorious among long duration military, particularly naval, expeditions during which participants were deprived of foods containing Vitamin C.

An [[autoimmune disease]] such as [[lupus erythematosus]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Al-Hadithy |first=H. |last2=''et al.'' |year=1982 |first2=DA |last3=Addison |first3=IE |last4=Goldstone |first4=AH |last5=Snaith |first5=ML |title=Neutrophil function in systemic lupus erythematosus and other collagen diseases |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |volume=41 |pmid=7065727 |issue=1 |pmc=1000860 |pages=33–38 |doi=10.1136/ard.41.1.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may attack healthy collagen fibers.

Many bacteria and viruses have virulence factors which destroy collagen or interfere with its production.

==Use==
Collagen is one of the long, [[fibrous protein|fibrous structural proteins]] whose functions are quite different from those of [[globular protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s. Tough bundles of collagen called ''collagen fibers'' are a major component of the [[extracellular matrix]] that supports most tissues and gives cells structure from the outside, but collagen is also found inside certain cells. Collagen has great [[tensile strength]], and is the main component of [[fascia]], [[cartilage]], [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[bone]] and skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fratzl |first=P. |title=Collagen: Structure and Mechanics |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=038773905X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Buehler |first=M.

It is present in the [[cornea]] and lens of the [[human eye|eye]] in [[crystal]]line form. It is also used in [[plastic surgery|cosmetic surgery]] and [[burn (injury)|burns surgery]]. [[Hydrolyze]]d collagen can play an important role in weight management, as a protein, it can be advantageously used for its satiating power.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Industrial uses===
If collagen is sufficiently denatured, e.g. by heating, the three tropocollagen strands separate partially or completely into globular domains, containing a different secondary structure to the normal collagen polyproline II (PPII), e.g. [[random coil]]s. This process describes the formation of [[gelatin]], which is used in many [[food]]s, including flavored [[gelatin dessert]]s. Besides food, gelatin has been used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and photography industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gmap-gelatin.com/gelatin_adv.html |title=Gelatin's Advantages: Health, Nutrition and Safety |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From a nutritional point of view, collagen and gelatin are a poor-quality sole source of protein since they do not contain all the [[essential amino acid]]s in the proportions that the human body requires—they are not '[[complete protein]]s' (as defined by food science, not that they are partially structured). Manufacturers of collagen-based [[dietary supplement]]s claim that their products can improve skin and [[fingernail]] quality as well as joint health. However, mainstream scientific research has not shown strong evidence to support these claims.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Individuals with problems in these areas are more likely to be suffering from some other underlying condition (such as normal aging, dry skin, arthritis etc.) rather than just a protein deficiency.

From the Greek for glue, ''kolla'', the word collagen means &quot;[[animal glue|glue]] producer&quot; and refers to the early process of boiling the skin and [[tendon|sinews]] of [[horse]]s and other animals to obtain glue. Collagen adhesive was used by [[Egypt]]ians about 4,000 years ago, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] used it in [[bow (weapon)|bows]] about 1,500 years ago. The oldest glue in the world, [[radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] as more than 8,000 years old, was found to be collagen—used as a protective lining on rope baskets and [[embroidery|embroidered]] [[Textile|fabric]]s, and to hold [[list of eating utensils|utensils]] together; also in crisscross decorations on [[human]] [[human skull|skull]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/glue.html |title=Oldest Glue Discovered |work=Archaeology |date=May 21, 1998 |first=Amélie A. |last=Walker }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collagen normally converts to gelatin, but survived due to the dry conditions. Animal glues are [[thermoplastic]], softening again upon reheating, and so they are still used in making [[musical instrument]]s such as fine [[violin]]s and [[guitar]]s, which may have to be reopened for repairs—an application incompatible with tough, [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[plastic]] adhesives, which are permanent. Animal sinews and skins, including [[leather]], have been used to make useful articles for millennia.

Gelatin-[[resorcinol]]-[[formaldehyde]] glue (and with formaldehyde replaced by less-toxic pentanedial and [[glyoxal|ethanedial]]) has been used to repair experimental incisions in [[rabbit]] [[lung]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ennker |first=I.

==Medical uses==
===Cardiac applications===
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}
The four dense collagen [[Valve]] rings, the [[Central Body of the Heart]] and the [[Cardiac Skeleton of the Heart]] are histologically bound to the [[Myocardium]]. Collagen contribution to [[Heart Performance]] summarily represents an essential, unique and moving solid anchor opposed to the [[Fluid]] mechanics of [[Blood]] within the heart. This structure is an impermeable firewall that excludes both blood and electrical influence (except through anatomical channels) from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. As proof, one could posit that [[Atrial Fibrillation]] almost never deteriorates to [[Ventricular Fibrillation]].
Individual valvular leaflets are held in [[Sail]] shape by collagen under variable [[Pressure]]. [[Calcium]] deposition within collagen occurs as a natural consequence of aging. Calcium rich fixed points in an otherwise moving display of blood and muscle enable current [[Cardiac Imaging]] technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in [[Cardiac Input]] and blood out [[Cardiac Output]]. Specified imaging such as [[Calcium Scoring]] illustrates the utility of this methodology, especially in an aging patient subject to [[pathology]] of the collagen underpinning.

===Cosmetic Surgery===
Collagen has been widely used in cosmetic surgery, as a healing aid for burn patients for reconstruction of bone and a wide variety of dental, orthopedic and surgical purposes. Both human and bovine collagen is widely used as dermal fillers for treatment of wrinkles and skin aging.&lt;ref name=&quot;pharmax2&quot;&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-4e-dermal-fillers/ Dermal Fillers | The Ageing Skin]&lt;/ref&gt; Some points of interest are:
#when used cosmetically, there is a chance of allergic reactions causing prolonged redness; however, this can be virtually eliminated by simple and inconspicuous patch testing prior to cosmetic use, and
#most medical collagen is derived from young beef cattle (bovine) from certified BSE ([[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]) free animals. Most manufacturers use donor animals from either &quot;closed herds&quot;, or from countries which have never had a reported case of BSE such as Australia, Brazil and New Zealand.
#porcine (pig) tissue is also widely used for producing collagen sheet for a variety of surgical purposes.
#alternatives using the patient's own [[fat]], [[hyaluronic acid]] or [[polyacrylamide]] gel are readily available.

===Reconstructive surgical uses===
Collagens are widely employed in the construction of [[artificial skin]] substitutes used in the management of severe [[burn (injury)|burns]].  These collagens may be derived from bovine, equine or porcine, and even human, sources and are sometimes used in combination with [[silicone]]s, [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[fibroblast]]s, [[growth factor]]s and other substances.

Collagen is also sold as a pill commercially as a joint mobility supplement with poor references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.articlecat.com/Article/Hydrolyzed-Collagen--Protein-Hydrate/21273 |title=Hydrolyzed Collagen pills usages |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because proteins are broken down into amino acids before absorption, there is no reason for orally ingested collagen to affect connective tissue in the body, except through the effect of individual amino acid supplementation.

Recently an alternative to animal-derived collagen has become available.  Although expensive, this human collagen, derived from donor cadavers, [[placenta]]s and aborted fetuses, may minimize the possibility of immune reactions.

Although it cannot be absorbed through the skin, collagen is now being used as a main ingredient for some cosmetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.articlesbase.com/skin-care-articles/can-collagen-be-absorbed-into-the-skin-or-is-it-all-just-one-big-hoax-674325.html |title=www.articlesbase.com |work= |date= }} {{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collagen is also frequently used in scientific research applications for cell culture, studying cell behavior and cellular interactions with the extracellular environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blow |first=Nathan |year=2009 |title=Cell culture: building a better matrix |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=619–622 |doi=10.1038/nmeth0809-619 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppliers such as [http://www.trevigen.com/angiocell/cultrex.php Trevigen] manufacture rat and bovine Collagen I and  mouse Collagen IV.

==Fossil record==
Because the synthesis of collagen requires a high level of atmospheric oxygen, complex animals may not have been able to evolve until the atmosphere was oxygenic enough for collagen synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~pgore/geology/geo102/cambrian.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of collagen may have allowed cuticle, shell and muscle formation.  However, the preservation of collagen in the fossil record is very scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1502-3931.1996.tb01844.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is mounting evidence—which remains controversial—that collagen has been preserved in dinosaur specimens dated as long ago as {{Ma|80}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1165069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also worth noting are the actinofibrils, collagen fibers present on the wings of [[pterosaurs]].

'''''Calvin and Hobbes''''' is &lt;!-- do not change to &quot;was&quot; per Wikipedia guidelines for fiction --&gt; a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[daily strip|daily comic strip]] that was written and illustrated by American [[cartoonist]] [[Bill Watterson]], and [[Print syndication|syndicated]] from November 18, 1985, to December 31, 1995. It follows the humorous antics of [[Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes)|Calvin]],  a precocious and adventurous six-year-old boy, and [[Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)|Hobbes]], his sardonic [[stuffed toy|stuffed]] [[tiger]]. The pair are named after [[John Calvin]], a 16th-century French [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[Theology|theologian]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]], a 17th-century English [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/trivia.html| title=Calvin and Hobbes Trivia| publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]| accessdate = 2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of its popularity, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was featured in over 2,400 newspapers worldwide; as of January 2010,{{Update after|2011|2|1}} reruns of the strip still appear in more than 50 countries. Nearly 45 million copies of the [[List of Calvin and Hobbes books|18 ''Calvin and Hobbes'' books]] have been sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleve2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= 'Calvin and Hobbes' fans still pine 15 years after its exit | publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]] | url= http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/fans_still_pine_for_calvin_and.html | author = John Campanelli| date=February 1, 2010 | accessdate=2010-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Calvin and Hobbes'' is set in the contemporary [[United States]] in an unspecified [[suburb]]an area. The strip depicts Calvin's flights of fantasy and his friendship with Hobbes, and also examines Calvin's relationships with family and classmates. Hobbes' dual nature is the [[Motif_(narrative)|motif]] that defines the strip: to Calvin, Hobbes is a live [[anthropomorphic]] tiger; all the other characters see him as an inanimate stuffed toy.  Though the series does not mention specific political figures or current events, it does explore broad issues like [[environmentalism]], [[public education]], and the flaws of [[Opinion poll#Potential for inaccuracy|opinion poll]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;astor1989&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Watterson and Walker Differ On Comics: &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; creator criticizes today's cartooning while &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;/&quot;Hi and Lois&quot; creator defends it at meeting | publisher=Editor and Publisher | author=David Astor | date=November 4, 1989 | page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{rquote|right|I thought it was perhaps too 'adult,' too literate.  When my then-8-year-old son remarked, &quot;This is the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' for kids!&quot; I suspected we had something unusual on our hands.|Lee Salem, Watterson's editor at [[Universal Press Syndicate|Universal]], recalling his reaction after seeing Watterson's first submission&lt;ref name=&quot;cleve2010&quot;/&gt;}}
''Calvin and Hobbes'' was conceived when Bill Watterson, working in an advertising job he detested,&lt;ref name=&quot;detest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/spe_kc.htm |

He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates. [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]] finally responded positively to one strip, which featured a side character (the main character's little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. Told that these characters were the strongest, Watterson began a new strip centered on them.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=The Tiger Strikes Again | author=Neely Tucker | date=October 4, 2005 | publisher=Washington Post|page=C01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though United Feature rejected the new strip, eventually [[Universal Press Syndicate]] decided to take it.&lt;ref name=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  title=Calvin and Hobbes Creator Draws On the Simple Life | author=Paul Dean | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=May 26, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;christie1987&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=An Interview With Bill Watterson: The creator of Calvin and Hobbes on cartooning, syndicates, Garfield, Charles Schulz, and editors | author=Andrew Christie | publisher=Honk magazine |month=January | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first strip was published on November 18, 1985,&lt;ref name=&quot;pr_calvin&quot; /&gt; and the series quickly became a hit. Within a year of [[print syndication|syndication]], the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers. Before long the strip was in [[Calvin and Hobbes in translation|wide circulation]] outside the [[United States]]. By April 1, 1987, Watterson and his work were featured in an article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;simple&quot; /&gt; ''Calvin and Hobbes'' twice earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the [[National Cartoonists Society]] in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988. He was nominated again in 1992. The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuben&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = NCS Reuben Award winners (1975–present) | work = National Cartoonists Society | url = http://www.reuben.org/ncs/archive/divisions/reuben2.asp| accessdate = July 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watterson took two extended breaks from writing new strips, from May 6, 1991, to February 1, 1992, and from April 4 through December 31, 1994.
In 1995, Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip:

{{quotation|I will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.

That so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.}}

The 3,160th and final strip ran on Sunday, December 31, 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr_calvin&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/pr_calvin.html| work=Andrews McMeel Press Release|accessdate = 2009-05-02|title=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes|publisher=[[Andrews &amp; McMeel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicted Calvin and Hobbes outside in freshly fallen snow, reveling in the wonder and excitement of the winter scene. &quot;It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy... Let's go exploring!&quot; Calvin exclaims as they zoom off over the snowy hills on their sled,&lt;ref name=&quot;CC+H_final_strip&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 3, p. 481. Comic originally published 1995-12-31.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving, according to one critic ten years later, &quot;a hole in the comics page that no strip has been able to fill.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4968065 |series=Day to Day |serieslink=Day to Day |credits=Charles Solomon |network=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |airdate=2005-10-21 |minutes=3:28.50 }} “In the final strip, Calvin and Hobbes put aside their conflicts and rode their sled into a snowy forest. They left behind a hole in the comics page that no strip has been able to fill.”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syndication and formatting===
From the outset, Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused. To him, the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by [[commercialization]], which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art.&lt;ref name=&quot;west1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Richard Samuel West| title = Interview: Bill Watterson| journal = Comics Journal| month = February | year = 1989| url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html| issue = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watterson also grew increasingly frustrated by the gradual shrinking of available space for comics in the newspapers. He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or spare artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.&lt;ref name=&quot;west1989&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;astor1988&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Watterson Knocks the Shrinking of Comics | author=David Astor | publisher=Editor and Publisher | date=December 3, 1988 | page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watterson strove for a full-page version of his strip, in contrast to the few cells allocated for most strips. He longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as ''[[Little Nemo]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, ''The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheapening&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Watterson | first=Bill | authorlink=Bill Watterson | year=1989 | url=http://www.planetcartoonist.com/editorial/state_watterson.shtml | title=The Cheapening of Comics | publisher=PlanetCartoonist | accessdate = 2006-03-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070209234303/http://www.planetcartoonist.com/editorial/state_watterson.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Watterson's first [[sabbatical]] from the strip, Universal Press Syndicate continued to charge newspapers full price to re-run old ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips. Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had little choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Astor |first=David |title=Nine-month Vacation For Bill Watterson |page=34 |publisher=Editor &amp; Publisher |date=1991-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comics half page.svg|thumb|right|This half-page layout can easily be rearranged for [[:File:Comics full page.svg|full]], [[:File:Comics third page.svg|third]], and [[:File:Comics quarter page.svg|quarter]] pages.]]
Upon Watterson's return, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[tabloid]] page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists criticized him&lt;ref name=&quot;keanecriticism&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Astor | first = David | title = Cartoonists discuss 'Calvin' requirement | page = 34 | publisher = Editor &amp; Publisher | date = 1992-03-07 | url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165 | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business. Watterson had negotiated the deal to allow himself more creative freedom in the Sunday comics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally draining fight to prevent ''Calvin and Hobbes'' from being merchandised. Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the duration of a new contract term, I proposed a redesigned Sunday format that would permit more panel flexibility. To my surprise and delight, Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as an unbreakable half page (more space than I'd dared to ask for), despite the expected resistance of editors.

To this day, my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the new format, appreciated the difference, and were happy to run the larger strip, but I think it's fair to say that this was not the most common reaction. The syndicate had warned me to prepare for numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature, but after a few weeks of dealing with howling, purple-faced editors, the syndicate suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper. ... I focused on the bright side: I had complete freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations.

For all the yelling and screaming by outraged editors, I remain convinced that the larger Sunday strip gave newspapers a better product and made the comics section more fun for readers. Comics are a visual medium. A strip with a lot of drawing can be exciting and add some variety. Proud as I am that I was able to draw a larger strip, I don't expect to see it happen again any time soon. In the newspaper business, space is money, and I suspect most editors would still say that the difference is not worth the cost. Sadly, the situation is a vicious circle: because there's no room for better artwork, the comics are simply drawn; because they're simply drawn, why should they have more room?&lt;ref name=&quot;sundaypages&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Watterson | first=Bill | title=Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995 | month=September | year=2001 | page=15 | isbn = 0-7407-2135-6 | publisher=A. McMeel Pub. | location=Kansas City, MO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Animation===
Watterson did consider allowing Calvin and Hobbes to be [[animation|animated]], and has expressed admiration for the art form of animation. In a 1989 interview in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' he said:

{{quotation|If you look at the old cartoons by [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]], you'll see that there are a lot of things single drawings just can't do. Animators can get away with incredible distortion and exaggeration ... because the animator can control the length of time you see something. The bizarre exaggeration barely has time to register, and the viewer doesn't ponder the incredible license he's witnessed.

In a comic strip, you just show the highlights of action—you can't show the buildup and release ... or at least not without slowing down the pace of everything to the point where it's like looking at individual frames of a movie, in which case you've probably lost the effect you were trying to achieve. In a comic strip, you can suggest motion and time, but it's very crude compared to what an animator can do. I have a real awe for good animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;west1989&quot;/&gt;}}

After this he was asked if it was &quot;a bit scary to think of hearing Calvin's voice.&quot; He responded that it was &quot;very scary,&quot; and that although he loved the visual possibilities of animation, the thought of casting voice actors to play his characters was uncomfortable. He was also unsure whether he wanted to work with an animation team, as he had done all previous work by himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;west1989&quot;/&gt; Ultimately, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was never made into an [[animated cartoon|animated series]]. Watterson later stated in the ''Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'' that he liked the fact that his strip was a &quot;low-tech, one-man operation,&quot; and took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchandising==
Bill Watterson insists that cartoon strips should stand on their own as an art form, and has resisted the use of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' in merchandising of any sort.&lt;ref name=&quot;christie1987&quot; /&gt; Watterson explained in a 2005 press release:

{{quotation|Actually, I wasn't against all merchandising when I started the strip, but each product I considered seemed to violate the spirit of the strip, contradict its message, and take me away from the work I loved. If my syndicate had let it go at that, the decision would have taken maybe 30 seconds of my life.&lt;ref name = &quot;amiv&quot;/&gt;}}

Almost no legitimate ''Calvin and Hobbes'' merchandise exists outside of the book collections.&lt;ref name=&quot;items&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/citems.html | title=A Concise Guide To All Legitimate (and some not-so-legitimate) Merchandise | accessdate = 2006-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions produced during the strip's original run include two 16-month calendars (1988–1989 and 1989–1990), and the textbook ''Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes'',&lt;ref name=&quot;twch&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmen |first1=Linda |last2=Santella-Johnson |first2=Mary |last3=Watterson |first3=Bill |authorlink3=Bill Watterson |others=Cover and supplementary art by Jan Roebken |title=Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes |year=1993 |publisher=Playground Publishing |location=Fargo, North Dakota |isbn=1878849158 |laysummary=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cteaching.html |laydate=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been described as &quot;perhaps the most difficult piece of official ''Calvin and Hobbes'' memorabilia to find.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;looking&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Martell |first=Nevin |title=Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip |edition=Revised |year=2010 |publisher=Continuum Books |isbn=978-1-4411-0685-8 |page=236 |laysummary=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2010/08/31/expanded-book-chronicles-search-for-bill-watterson-calvin-and-hobbes-creator |laydate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2010 the [[United States Postal Service]] released a set of [[postage stamps]] honoring five comic strips, one of them ''Calvin and Hobbes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2010/pr10_068.htm |title=USPS News Release: Sunday Funnies Comic Strips Debut on Stamps |date=2010-07-16 |work=USPS.com |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |location=Columbus, Ohio |accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip's immense popularity has led to the appearance of various [[counterfeit]] items such as window decals and T-shirts that often feature [[Off-color humor|crude humor]], [[binge drinking]] and other themes that are not found in Watterson's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark, some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy, while other makers made no changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |title=Calvin's Unauthorized Leak: Stock Car Fans Misuse Comics Character |publisher=Washington Post |page=B9 |date=1997-07-17 |url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cstockcars.html |accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watterson wryly commented, &quot;I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] logo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amiv&quot; /&gt;

==Style and influences==
Precedents to Calvin's fantasy world can be found in [[Crockett Johnson]]'s ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'', [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', [[Percy Crosby]]'s ''[[Skippy (comic strip)|Skippy]]'', [[Berkeley Breathed]]'s ''[[Bloom County]]'', and [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', while Watterson's use of comics as sociopolitical commentary reaches back to [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' and [[Quino]]'s ''[[Mafalda]]''. Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson's outlook on comics during his formative years.&lt;ref name=&quot;christie1987&quot; /&gt;

In addition to philosophical antecedents to Watterson’s work, he references preexisting, archetypical cartoon characters as a tool to create empathetic responses in the reader. Echoes of not only Charlie Brown, but also of [[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]], induce a nostalgic and warmhearted response in the new reader of any ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strip, even as the subject matter challenges that viewer to consider its extra-comical implications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In early strips, the drawings have a flatter, ''[[Peanuts]]''-like look but show more depth in later strips.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Notable elements of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion, and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more panel space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue, and greater use of [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the &quot;Noodle Incident&quot; and the [[Children's literature|children's book]] ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be &quot;more outrageous&quot; than he could portray.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenth_p200&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watterson's technique started with minimalist [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil sketches]] drawn with a [[light pencil]] (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work); he then would use a small [[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|sable]] brush and [[India ink]] on Strathmore [[bristol board]] to complete most of the remaining drawing. He lettered dialogue with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]] [[fountain pen]], and he used a [[quill|crowquill]] pen for odds and ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watterson (1995) p 20&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He used [[Liquid Paper]] to correct mistakes. He was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip.&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Bill Watterson | last = Watterson | first = Bill | title = Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985–1995 | publisher = Andrews McMeel | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7407-2135-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Calvin and Hobbes'' began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watterson (1995) p 20&quot;/&gt;

===Art and academia===
Watterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world, principally through Calvin's unconventional creations of [[snowman|snowmen]] but also through other expressions of childhood art. When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things (a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in a rocket ship, for example), Calvin proclaims himself &quot;on the cutting edge of the ''[[avant-garde]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | cartoonist = Bill Watterson | title = Calvin and Hobbes | date = October 31, 19990 | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | cartoonist = Bill Watterson | title = Calvin and Hobbes | date = November 1, 19990 | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman. His next sculpture &quot;speaks to the horror of our own mortality, inviting the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life.&quot; In further strips, Calvin's creative instincts diversify to include sidewalk drawings (or, as he terms them, examples of &quot;suburban [[postmodernism]]&quot;).

Watterson also lampooned the [[academia|academic world]]. In one example, Calvin writes a &quot;[[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] [[autobiography]],&quot; recruiting Hobbes to take pictures of him doing stereotypical kid activities like playing sports in order to make him seem more well-adjusted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In another strip, he carefully crafts an &quot;[[artist's statement]],&quot; claiming that such essays convey more messages than artworks themselves ever do (Hobbes blandly notes, &quot;You misspelled ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He indulges in what Watterson calls &quot;[[psychobabble|pop psychobabble]]&quot; to justify his destructive rampages and shift blame to his parents, citing &quot;[[Codependence|toxic codependency]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In one instance, he pens a book report based on the theory that the purpose of academic writing is to &quot;inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity,&quot; titled ''The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in ''[[Dick and Jane]]:'' A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes.'' Displaying his creation to Hobbes, he remarks, &quot;Academia, here I come!&quot; Watterson explains that he adapted this jargon (and similar examples from several other strips) from an actual book of art criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Bill Watterson | last = Watterson | first = Bill | title = The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book | publisher = Andrews McMeel | month = October | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Watterson's satirical essays serve to attack both sides, criticizing both the commercial mainstream and the artists who are supposed to be &quot;outside&quot; it. Not long after he began drawing his &quot;Dinosaurs in Rocket Ships&quot; series, Calvin tells Hobbes:

{{quotation|Calvin: The hard part for us ''avant-garde'' post-modern artists is deciding whether or not to embrace [[commercialism]]. Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market that's simply hungry for the next new thing? Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so it's better suited for mass consumption?

Of course, when an artist goes commercial, he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker. He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend. He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
Oh, what the heck. I'll do it.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
Hobbes: (Rolling eyes) That wasn't so hard.}}

The strip for Sunday, May 5, 1991 criticized the naming of The [[Big Bang]] as unevocative of the wonders behind it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/05/05/ Online] at gocomics.com with a date of May 5, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The strip coined &quot;Horrendous Space Kablooie,&quot; an alternative which has achieved some popularity amongst scientists, particularly in informal discussion and often shortened to &quot;the HSK.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sampson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Simon Singh |last=Singh |first=Simon |title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2006 |isbn=978-0007162208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been referenced in newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D91E31F932A25755C0A965958260|title= Calling 'Big Bang' a Dud, Journal Seeks New Name|publisher=New York Times|date=1993-06-11|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3626029/We-are-wandering-stardust.html|title=We are wandering stardust|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=2004-10-17|accessdate=2008-02-27 | location=London | first=Andy | last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1fKKq44B9ewC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=horrendous+space+kablooie|title=Creation, Evolution, and Modern Science|author=Kerby Anderson, Raymond G.

===Social criticisms===
With rare exceptions, such as Calvin once stating his desire to grow a beard like the members of [[ZZ Top]], the strip avoids reference to actual people or events. Watterson lampoons public decadence and apathy, commercialism, and the pandering nature of the mass media.

In one instance, Calvin tells Hobbes about a science-fiction story he has read in which machines turn humans into zombie slaves. Hobbes comments about the irony of machines controlling people instead of the other way around; Calvin then exclaims, &quot;I'll say. Hey! What time is it?? My TV show is on!&quot; and sprints back inside to watch it. Another strip depicts Calvin's [[science-fiction]] story about an extraterrestrial spaceship sucking up Earth's oceans and air. To the cries of the suffocating victims, the aliens reply that this is preferable to the loss of their jobs. Calvin is concerned that his story is too far-fetched, to which Hobbes responds, &quot;Not enough, really.&quot;

==Characters==
{{See also|Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes}}

===Calvin===
{{Main|Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes)}}
Calvin, named after the 16th-century theologian [[John Calvin]], is an impulsive, creative, imaginative, energetic, curious, intelligent, hypocritical, selfish, rude, and ill-tempered six-year-old, whose last name is never mentioned in the strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Watterson  | first = Bill  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  | publisher = Andrews and McMeel  | year = 1995  | location =   | page = 21  | url =   | doi =   | isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his poor grades in school, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through his sophisticated vocabulary and a philosophical mind:

{{quotation| Calvin: &quot;Dad, are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all of the opportunities you botched?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Dad: &quot;If I were, you can bet I'd be re-evaluating my strategy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Calvin to his mom, later: &quot;Mom, Dad keeps insulting me.&quot;}}

He commonly wears his distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants, and white-and-magenta sneakers. He also wears a jacket when going to school or when playing in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 1, p. 303. Comic originally published 1987-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an enthusiastic reader of comic books and has a tendency to order items marketed in comic books or on boxes of his favorite cereal, Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs. Watterson described Calvin:

{{quotation|Calvin is pretty easy to do because he is outgoing and rambunctious, and there's not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth.
I guess he's a little too intelligent for his age. The thing that I really enjoy about him is that he has no sense of restraint; he doesn't have the experience yet to know the things that you shouldn't do.&lt;ref name=&quot;williams1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Gene | year = 1987 | title = Watterson: Calvin's other alter ego | work = [[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Calvin also has a sensitive side as well. This is displayed, for example, when he finds a dying raccoon and tries to save it but fails. He is then shown crying. The scene is made even more poignant by Calvin asking Hobbes not to &quot;go anywhere&quot;, and Hobbes solemnly promising he wouldn't.

===Hobbes===
{{Main|Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)}}
From the other characters' perspectives, Hobbes is Calvin's stuffed tiger. From Calvin's point of view Hobbes is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tiger, much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas. When the perspective shifts to any other character, readers again see merely a stuffed animal, usually seated at an off-kilter angle and blankly staring into space. Watterson explains:

{{quotation|&quot;When Hobbes is a stuffed toy in one panel and alive in the next, I'm juxtaposing the 'grown-up' version of reality with Calvin's version, and inviting the reader to decide which is truer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;christie1987&quot; /&gt;}}

Hobbes' true nature is made more ambiguous by episodes that seem to attribute real-life consequences to Hobbes' actions. For example, Hobbes plays a game of pouncing on Calvin the moment he arrives home from school, an act which always leaves Calvin with bruises and scrapes that are evident to other characters. Hobbes also manages to tie Calvin to a chair in such a way that Calvin's father is unable to understand how he could have done it himself.

Hobbes is named after the 17th-century [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Thomas Hobbes]], who held what Watterson describes as &quot;a dim view of human nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson1995&quot;/&gt; Hobbes (the tiger) is much more rational and aware of consequences than Calvin, but seldom interferes with Calvin's troublemaking beyond a few oblique warnings. Hobbes is sarcastic when Calvin is being hypocritical about things he dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Watterson  | first = Bill  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  | publisher = Andrews and McMeel  | year = 1995  | location =   | page = 22  | url =   | doi =   | isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the debut strip clearly shows Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a snare (with a tuna sandwich as the bait), a later comic (August 1, 1989) indicates that Hobbes has been with Calvin since Calvin was a baby:

{{quotation|
Calvin: &quot;The whole first half of my life is a complete blank! What on earth did I know that someone wanted me to forget?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
Hobbes: &quot;I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.s-anand.net/calvinandhobbes.html#19940809&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Watterson eventually decided that it was not important to establish how Calvin and Hobbes met.&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson1995&quot;/&gt;

===Calvin's parents===
Calvin's [[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Calvin's mother|mother]] and [[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Calvin's father|father]] are American [[middle class|middle-class]] parents. Like many other characters in the strip, their relatively down-to-earth and sensible attitudes serve as a foil for Calvin's outlandish behavior.

Watterson says some fans were angered by the way Calvin's parents thought of Calvin. This is shown by the fact that Calvin's father claimed that he wanted a dachshund instead of Calvin, and often tries to &quot;deny&quot; that Calvin is his biological son:
{{quotation|Mom: You're not sorry we had Calvin, are you? &lt;br /&gt;
Dad: Are ''you''? &lt;br /&gt;
Mom: I asked first. Besides, it wasn't all ''my'' decision. &lt;br /&gt;
Dad: All ''I'' know is, ''I'' offered to buy us a dachshund, but no, ''you'' said...}}
{{quotation|Dad: Someday I'm going to get my DNA checked to see if he's really my kid. &lt;br /&gt;
Mom: Take my word for it.}}

Calvin's parents are not above some outrageous behavior of their own. For example, Calvin asks for a cigarette and his mother gives him one to teach him a lesson. Calvin's father tells Calvin sarcastic lies when asked a straight question, and Calvin often believes them:
{{quotation|Calvin: Dad, were there dinosaurs when you were a kid? &lt;br /&gt;
Dad: Oh, sure, your grandfather and I used to put on leopard skins and hunt brontosaurus for all the clan rituals.}}

Watterson defends what Calvin's parents do, remarking that in the case of parenting a kid like Calvin, &quot;I think they do a better job than I would.&quot; Calvin's father is overly concerned with &quot;character building&quot; activities in a number of strips, either in the things he makes Calvin do or in the masochistic eccentricities of his own lifestyle. For example, Calvin's father is shown coming home from an early morning run in the snow, which he follows with a bowl of cold [[oatmeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin's father is a [[patent attorney]] and his mother is a [[Homemaker|stay-at-home mom]]. Both remain unnamed except as &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad,&quot; or pet names such as &quot;honey&quot; and &quot;dear&quot; between themselves. Watterson says, &quot;As far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad.&quot; Calvin's Uncle Max was in the strip for a week but could not refer to the parents by name, which was one of the main reasons Max never reappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson1995&quot;/&gt;

===Susie Derkins===
[[Susie Derkins]], the only important character with both a first and last name, is a classmate of Calvin's who lives on his street. Named for the pet [[beagle]] of Watterson's wife's family,&lt;ref name=&quot;chars&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/characters.html | title=Cast of Characters | publisher=Andrew McMeel | work=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (press release) | accessdate = 2006-03-19 | author=Bill Watterson}}&lt;/ref&gt; she appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvin's class. She is polite and studious, with a mild imagination consisting of [[stereotype|stereotypical]] young-girl games such as playing house or hosting tea parties with her stuffed animals. However, she is also depicted playing imaginary games with Calvin in which she is a high-powered lawyer or politician and he is her [[househusband]]. Though both of them hate to admit it, Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common. For example, Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed bunny rabbit named &quot;[[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Mr. Bun|Mr. Bun]],&quot; and Calvin, of course, has Hobbes. Susie also has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak, which can be seen when she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or clobbers Calvin when he attacks her with snowballs. Susie also regularly beats Calvin in confrontations such as their water-balloon and snowball fights, employing guile or force. Hobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie, much to Calvin's disgust. Calvin starts a &quot;club&quot; (of which he and Hobbes are the only members) that he calls G.R.O.S.S. ('''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy girl'''S''') club, and while holding &quot;meetings&quot; in Calvin's treehouse or in the &quot;box of secrecy&quot; in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some way to annoy or socially maim Susie, most of which backfire on them completely. Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other, and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson1995&quot;/&gt;

==Secondary characters==
Calvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters. These include his [[babysitter]], the school bully, his school teacher and the school principal.

===Rosalyn===
Rosalyn is Calvin's [[babysitter]]. She takes advantage of his parents' desperation to leave the house and the fact that no one else will babysit for Calvin by demanding advances and raises. In her final appearance in the strip, she at last forces Calvin to behave by using his own haphazard rules against him during a game of Calvinball. She is also probably the only character in the strip whom Calvin really fears, as she does not mince words or actions to get Calvin to behave or go to bed on time. Watterson put her in a Sunday strip early on, never thinking of her as a regular character. But Rosalyn's intimidation of Calvin surprised Watterson, so she came back several times. At one point she was Calvin's swimming instructor, though he was only shown to attend one lesson.

===Moe===
Moe is the stereotypical [[Bullying|bully]] character, a large, cruel, dimwitted &quot;six-year-old who shaves&quot; who shoves Calvin against walls or onto the ground while demanding his lunch money and calling him &quot;Twinky,&quot; &quot;Shrimp,&quot; &quot;Twerp,&quot; or &quot;Squirt.&quot; Moe is the only regular character whose speech is shown in an unusual font: his frequently monosyllabic dialogue is shown in crude, lower-case letters. Watterson describes Moe as &quot;every jerk I've ever known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watterson1995&quot;/&gt;

===Miss Wormwood===
Miss Wormwood is Calvin's world-weary teacher, named after the junior devil in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''. She usually either wears a polka-dotted dress or a brown dress, and is another character who serves as a foil to Calvin's mischief. Calvin, when in his Spaceman Spiff persona, sees Miss Wormwood as a slimy, often dictatorial alien. Calvin refers to Miss Wormwood's indigestion (&quot;It's really gross how she drinks [[Maalox]] straight from the bottle&quot;), her medication (&quot;I wonder if her doctor knows she mixes all those prescriptions&quot;) and her smoking habit (&quot;Rumor has it she's up to two packs a day, unfiltered&quot;). Miss Wormwood reacts to Calvin's behavior by tightly shutting her eyes and thinking &quot;Five years until retirement&quot; repeatedly. Watterson describes her as &quot;an unhappy person&quot; due to her belief in the value of education.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mr. Spittle===
Mr. Spittle is the school principal to whose office Miss Wormwood threatens to send Calvin for his pranks for spanking. Infrequently, Susie also accompanies Calvin to the principal's office. Though his name has only been shown in one story, he has appeared many times including the first story about Calvin's duplicator.

===Mr. Lockjaw===
Mr. Lockjaw is the coach of the baseball team at Calvin's school. He is a squat, burly man with little patience for people like Calvin who lack a competitive spirit. When Calvin leaves the baseball team, Lockjaw calls him a &quot;quitter.&quot;

===Uncle Max===
Uncle Max is Calvin's uncle (Calvin's dad's brother). Uncle Max was originally meant as a character that could increase the possibilities of the strip: as Watterson noted, &quot;Calvin could go visit Uncle Max...&quot;. However, Watterson dropped the character after realizing that Uncle Max was not a promising character, and after finding that it was awkward that Uncle Max could not call Calvin's dad or Calvin's mom by their real names.

==Recurring elements==
There are many recurring gags in the strip, some in &quot;reality&quot; and others in Calvin's imagination. These are as follows:

===Calvin's roles===
{{Main|Calvin's alter egos (Calvin and Hobbes)}}

Calvin imagines himself as a great many things, including [[dinosaur]]s, [[elephant]]s, jungle-farers and superheroes. Three of his [[alter ego]]s are well-defined and recurrent:

* &quot;Spaceman Spiff&quot; is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his experiences in the third person. As Spiff, Calvin battles aliens (typically his parents or teacher) with a ray gun known as a &quot;zorcher&quot; (later &quot;death ray blaster&quot;, a water gun or rubber band) and travels to distant planets (his house, school, or neighborhood). Calvin's self-narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration: &quot;Zounds! Zorched by Zarches, Spaceman Spiff's crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons]] This is probably Calvin's most common alter ego. p 95&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;Tracer Bullet,&quot; a [[hardboiled]] private eye, says he has eight slugs in him (&quot;One's lead, and the rest are bourbon.&quot;). In one story, Bullet is called to a case in which a &quot;pushy dame&quot; (Calvin's mother) accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp (broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes). Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame's &quot;hired goon&quot; (Calvin's father having a talk with him). He made his debut when Calvin donned a [[fedora]]-type hat to hide a haircut Hobbes had given him.

* As &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; he pictures himself as a superhero in disguise, wearing a mask and a cape made by his mother, and narrating his own adventures. While in character as Stupendous Man, he refers to his alter ego as a mild mannered millionaire playboy. Stupendous Man almost always &quot;suffers defeat&quot; at the hands of his opponent. When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are &quot;moral victories.&quot; Stupendous Man's nemeses include &quot;Mom-Lady&quot; (Calvin's mom), &quot;Annoying Girl&quot; (Susie Derkins), &quot;Crab Teacher&quot; (Miss Wormwood), and &quot;Baby-Sitter Girl&quot; (Rosalyn). Some of the &quot;super powers&quot; of the villains have been revealed: Mom-Lady has a &quot;mind scrambling eyeball ray&quot; that wills the victim to &quot;do her nefarious bidding,&quot; and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a &quot;psycho beam&quot; which weakens &quot;Stupendous Man's stupendous will&quot;. The &quot;powers&quot; of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are unknown. Calvin often tries to pretend he and &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; are two different people, but it never seems to work. Calvin explains to Hobbes that after hearing about him using it to avoid taking a test, Calvin's mother finally takes the costume away from him for good.

===Cardboard boxes===
[[File:Scientific Progress Goes Boink (Calvin and Hobbes).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box, as seen on the cover of ''Scientific Progress Goes &quot;Boink&quot;'']]
Over the years Calvin has had several adventures involving corrugated [[cardboard box]]es, which he adapts for many different uses. In one strip, during which Calvin shows off his Transmogrifier, a device that transforms its user into any desired shape, Hobbes remarks, &quot;It's amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Essential Calvin and Hobbes]] p 229&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying [[Time travel|time machine]] and a duplicator. In addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a desk when he is attempting to sell things. Often, Calvin's merchandise is something that no one would want, such as &quot;suicide drink,&quot; &quot;a swift kick in the butt&quot; for one dollar, insurance,&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;frank appraisal of your looks&quot; for fifty cents. In one strip, he sells &quot;happiness&quot; for ten cents, which was a water balloon in the face, revealing that Calvin meant his own happiness. In another strip, he sold &quot;insurance,&quot; firing a slingshot at those who refused. The box has also functioned as a secret meeting place for G.R.O.S.S., as the &quot;Box of Secrecy&quot;.

|&lt;small&gt;The Calvinball theme song&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 3, p. 432. Comic originally published 1995-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
}}
Calvinball is a game played by Calvin and Hobbes as a rebellion against organized team sports; according to Hobbes, &quot;No sport is less organized than Calvinball!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CC+H_b2_p268-273&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 268–273. Comics originally published 1990-04-16 to 1990-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinball was first introduced to the readers at the end of a 1990 storyline involving Calvin reluctantly joining recess baseball. It quickly became a staple of the comic afterwards.

The only hint at the true creation of the game ironically comes from the last Calvinball strip, in which a game of football quickly devolves into a game of Calvinball. Calvin remarks that &quot;sooner or later, all our games turn into Calvinball,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 3, p. 438. Comic originally published 1995-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a similar scenario that directly led to the creation of the sport. Calvin and Hobbes usually play by themselves, although in one storyline Rosalyn (Calvin's baby-sitter) plays in return for Calvin doing his homework, and plays very well once she realizes that the rules are made up on the spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC+H_b3_p430-433&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 3, pp. 430–433. Comics originally published 1995-09-04 to 1995-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only consistent rule states that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, p. 292. Comic originally published 1990-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring is also arbitrary, with Hobbes at times reporting scores of &quot;Q to 12&quot; and &quot;oogy to boogy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 292, 336. Comics originally published 1990-05-27 and 1990-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The only recognizable sports Calvinball resembles are the ones it emulates (i.e., a cross between croquet, polo, badminton, capture the flag, and volleyball.) Equipment includes a [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] (the eponymous &quot;Calvinball&quot;), a [[croquet]] set, a [[badminton]] set, assorted flags, bags, signs, a [[hobby horse]], and enigmatic and never-pictured &quot;time-fracture wickets.&quot; Other things appear as needed, such as a bucket of ice-cold water, a water balloon, and various songs and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 273, 292, 336, 429; vol 3, pp. 430–433, 438. Comics originally published 1990-05-05, 1990-05-27, 1990-08-26, 1991-03-31, 1995-09-04 to 1995-09-16, and 1995-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Players also wear masks resembling [[blindfold]]s with holes for the eyes. When Rosalyn asks Calvin the reason for the requirement, Calvin responds, &quot;Sorry, no one's allowed to question the masks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CC+H_b3_p430-433&quot;/&gt; When asked how to play, Watterson states, &quot;It's pretty simple: you make up the rules as you go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinball is a [[nomic]] or self-modifying game, a contest of wits and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill, in which Hobbes (and on one occasion, Rosalyn) usually outwits Calvin, who takes it in stride, in contrast to his otherwise poor sportsmanship.

===Snow sculptures===
Calvin often creates horrendous/dark humor scenes with his snowmen. He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge, or pure enjoyment. Examples are Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; Snowman A eating snowcones taken from Snowman B, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back, a group of snowmen surrounding another snowman with his head on the ground, and snowmen representing the people he hates. &quot;The ones I '''really''' hate are small, so they'll go faster.&quot; he says.

Calvin's snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people's snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin's willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.

===Wagon and sled===
Calvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a [[wagon]], [[sled]], or [[toboggan]], depending on the season, as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because, according to Watterson, &quot;it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenth_p104&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 233, 325. Comics originally published 1990-01-07 and 1990-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt; it also frequently serves as a counterpoint or visual metaphor while Calvin ponders the meaning of life, death, God, or a variety of other weighty subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenth_p104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 1, pp. 26, 56, 217; vol. 2, pp. 120, 237, 267, 298, 443; vol 3, pp. 16, 170, 224, 326, 414. Comics originally published 1985-11-30, 1986-02-07, 1987-01-11, 1989-05-28, 1990-02-04, 1990-04-15, 1990-06-10, 1992-02-02, 1992-05-17, 1993-04-18, 1993-08-22, 1995-01-14, and 1995-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their rides end in spectacular crashes which leave them battered and broken, a fact which convinces Hobbes to sometimes hop off before a ride even begins.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, p. 373. Comic originally published 1990-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final strip, Calvin and Hobbes depart on their toboggan to go exploring.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC+H_final_strip&quot;/&gt; This theme is similar (perhaps even homage to) scenarios in Walt Kelley's ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''.

===G.R.O.S.S.===
G.R.O.S.S., which stands for '''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy girl'''S''', is a club which consists only of two members: Calvin and Hobbes. The club was created in the garage of their house, which led to the pushing and crashing of Calvin's parents' car, thus changing the club's location to Calvin's treehouse. They hold meetings to attempt to annoy Susie Derkins. Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house, and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being &quot;Dictator-for-Life&quot; and Hobbes being &quot;President-and-First-Tiger&quot;. They go into Calvin's treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them.

[[File:The Essential Calvin and Hobbes.png|thumb|right|The first ''Calvin and Hobbes'' treasury.]]
There are 18 ''Calvin and Hobbes'' books, published from 1987 to 2005. These include 11 collections, which form a complete archive of the newspaper strips, except for a single daily strip from November 28, 1985. (The collections ''do'' contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers. The alternate strip, a joke about Hobbes taking a bath in the [[washing machine]], has circulated around the Internet.)&lt;ref&gt;[[wikia:calvinandhobbes:Alternate strip|Comparison of alternate strip from November 28, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.

Watterson included some new material in the treasuries. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', which includes cartoons from the collections ''Calvin and Hobbes'' and ''Something Under the Bed Is Drooling'', the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town. The scene is based on Watterson's home town of [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]], and Calvin is holding the [[Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop]], an iconic candy and ice cream shop overlooking the town's namesake falls.&lt;ref name=&quot;APWattersonPrivacy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html|title=Calvin and Hobbes Creator Keeps Privacy|last=Milicia|first=Joe|date=2005-10-22|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the treasuries incorporate additional poetry; ''The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes'' book features a set of poems, ranging from just a few lines to an entire page, that cover topics such as Calvin's mother's &quot;hindsight&quot; and exploring the woods. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson presents a long poem explaining a night's battle against a monster from Calvin's perspective.

A complete collection of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips, in three hardcover volumes totaling 1440 pages, was released on October 4, 2005, by Andrews McMeel Publishing. It includes color prints of the art used on paperback covers, the treasuries' extra illustrated stories and poems, and a new introduction by Bill Watterson in which he talks about his inspirations and his story leading up to the publication of the strip. The alternate 1985 strip is still omitted, and two other strips (January 7, 1987, and November 25, 1988) have altered dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 1, p. 215; vol. 2, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=[[List of Calvin and Hobbes books|Weirdos from Another Planet!]] |year=1990 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, MO |isbn=0-8362-1862-0 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the release (which coincided with the strip's 20th anniversary and the tenth anniversary of its absence from newspapers), ''Calvin and Hobbes'' reruns were made available to newspapers from Sunday, September 4, 2005, through Saturday, December 31, 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;thereturnn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/features/thereturn/ | title=Calvin and Hobbes - We're Back! | date=September 4, 2005 | publisher=Universal Press Syndicate | accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;returning&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/returning.html | title=Calvin and Hobbes Returning to Newspapers — Sort Of | publisher=Editor and Publisher | author=David Astor | date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bill Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amiv&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/interview.html | title=Fans From Around the World Interview Bill Watterson | publisher=Andrews McMeel | accessdate = 2006-03-16 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early books were printed in smaller format in black and white. These were later reproduced in twos in color in the &quot;Treasuries&quot; (''Essential'', ''Authoritative'', and ''Indispensable''), except for the contents of ''Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons''. Those Sunday strips were not reprinted in color until the ''Complete'' collection was finally published in 2005. Every book since ''Snow Goons'' has been printed in a larger format with Sundays in color and weekday and Saturday strips larger than they appeared in most newspapers.

Watterson claims he named the books the &quot;''Essential'', ''Authoritative'', and ''Indispensable''&quot; because, as he says in ''The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', the books are &quot;obviously none of these things&quot;.

An officially licensed children's textbook entitled ''Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes'' was published in a single print-run in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;twch&quot; /&gt; The book, which has been &quot;highly recommend[ed]&quot; as a teaching resource,&lt;ref name=&quot;rief&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rief |first1=Sandra F. |last2=Heimburge |first2=Julie A. |title=How To Reach and Teach All Children in the Inclusive Classroom: Practical Strategies, Lessons, and Activities |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0787981549 |page=210 |quote=We highly recommend a wonderful book, ''Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes''...}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes five complete ''Calvin and Hobbes'' multi-strip story arcs together with lessons and questions to follow, such as, &quot;What do you think the principal meant when he said they had ''quite a file'' on Calvin?&quot; The book is very rare and increasingly sought by collectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;looking&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twchinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teachingwithcalvinandhobbes.blogspot.com/ | title=Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes: Information Regarding The Book | accessdate = 2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic response==
In her book ''When Toys Come Alive'', [[Lois Rostow Kuznets]] says that Hobbes serves both as a figure of Calvin's childish fantasy life and as an outlet for the expression of [[libido|libidinous]] desires more associated with adults. Kuznets also looks at Calvin's other fantasies, suggesting that they are a second tier of fantasies utilized in places like school where [[transitional object]]s such as Hobbes would not be socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Kuznets  | first = Lois Rostow  | title = When Toys Come Alive  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 1994  | location =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another academic critic, Philip Sandifer, using the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories of [[Jacques Lacan]], identifies the strip's depiction of time within Calvin's real and imaginary worlds as a manifestation of the Lacanian concepts of the Imaginary, the Real, and the Symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sandifer | first=Philip | title=When Real Things Happen to Imaginary Tigers | url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v3_3/sandifer/ | publisher=University of Florida | work=Imagetext Interdisciplinary Comic Studies | accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of original Sunday strips was exhibited at [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] in 2001. Watterson himself selected the strips and provided his own commentary for the exhibition catalog, which was later published by AndrewsMcMeel as ''Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985-1995''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazon-SundayPages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.ca/Calvin-Hobbes-Sunday-Pages-1985-1995/dp/0740721356|title=Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985-1995 (Paperback)|date=2001-06|work=(See product description for explanation by Lucy Caswell, curator of the exhibition) |publisher=Amazon.ca|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discontinuation of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', individual strips have been licensed for reprint in schoolbooks, including the [[Christian]] [[homeschooling]] book ''The Fallacy Detective'' in 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;tfd&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fallacy Detective | isbn=0974531502 | last=Bluedorn | first=Hans | publisher=Christian Logic | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the university-level [[philosophy]] reader ''Open Questions: Readings for Critical Thinking and Writing'' in 2005; in the latter, the [[ethical]] views of Watterson and his characters Calvin and Hobbes are discussed in relation to the views of professional philosophers.&lt;ref name=openques&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Lex |editor2-last=Runciman |title=Open Questions: Readings for Critical Thinking and Writing |year=2005 |publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's |isbn=978-0312416355 |pages=413–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics and other intellectuals were interviewed for a September 9, 2009 [[BBC Radio 4]] half-hour documentary about the comic strip, narrated by [[Phill Jupitus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Calvin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mr2fj|title=Calvin and Hobbes|last=Jupitus|first=Phill|date=2009-09-22|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Campaign for Real Ale''' ('''CAMRA''') is an independent, voluntary, [[consumer organisation]] based in [[St Albans]], England, whose main aims are promoting [[real ale]], [[Scrumpy|real cider]] and the traditional British [[public house|pub]]. It is now the largest single-issue consumer group in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and is a founding member of the [[European Beer Consumers' Union]] (EBCU).

==History==
[[Image:Camra bar towel.JPG|thumb|right|125px|CAMRA logo on a bar towel]]
The organisation was founded in 1971 by a group of four drinkers—Graham Lees, Bill Mellor, Michael Hardman, and Jim Makin—who were opposed to the growing mass production of beer and the homogenisation of the British [[brewing]] industry.  Other early influential members included Christopher Hutt, author of &quot;Death of the English Pub&quot;, who succeeded Hardman as chairman, Frank Baillie, author of &quot;The Beer Drinker's Companion&quot;, and later the current &quot;[[Good Beer Guide]]&quot; editor, [[Roger Protz]]. The original name was the Campaign for the Revitalisation of Ale.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
CAMRA's campaigns include promoting small brewing and pub businesses, reforming licensing laws, reducing tax on beer, and stopping continued consolidation among local British brewers. It also makes an effort to promote less common varieties of beer and other traditionally brewed beverages including [[Stout beer|stout]], [[Porter (beer)|porter]], [[Mild beer|mild]], traditional [[cider]], and [[perry]].

==Organisation==
[[Image:CamraBuildingHatfieldRoadStAlbans.jpg|thumb|The CAMRA office building in St Albans]]
In 2009 CAMRA announced that it had reached the 100,000 members mark and has since surpassed the 120,000 members mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member benefits include a monthly newspaper, &quot;What's Brewing&quot; and a quarterly &quot;BEER&quot; magazine, and free or reduced price admission to CAMRA-organised [[beer festival]]s.

CAMRA is organised on a federal basis, with numerous independent local branches, each covering a particular geographical area of the UK, that contribute to the central body of the organisation based in [[St Albans]]. The local branches are grouped into 16 regional branches across the UK, such as the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] or [[Greater Manchester]].

CAMRA has established influence at national government level, including [[English Heritage]], and has been designated by the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] as a &quot;super-complainant&quot; to the [[Office of Fair Trading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

CAMRA members receive a monthly newspaper called ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly colour magazine called ''Beer''.
They also run the [[Great British Beer Festival]], a yearly event held in London at which a large selection of [[cask ale]]s and ciders are tasted.  It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs.

==Festivals==
CAMRA supports and promotes numerous beer and cider festivals around the country each year, which are organised by local CAMRA branches around the UK. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which varies depending upon the area, and either covers entry only or includes a commemorative ⅓, ½ or 1 [[pint glass]] sporting the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, listing the drinks available for tasting and providing a brief description of each beverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=events List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campaign also organises an annual Great British Beer Festival in August, in London. Previously this was held at Olympia, but currently resides at Earl's Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbbf.camra.org.uk/home Great British Beer Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
CAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]], in which approximately 4,000 active CAMRA members from 200 local branches vote for their favourite pub. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who select the ones they like best. There are also the [[Pub Design Awards]], which are held in association with [[English Heritage]] and [[The Victorian Society]].  These comprise several categories, including new build, refurbished, and converted pubs.  The best known CAMRA award is the [[Champion Beer of Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is selected at the [[Great British Beer Festival]], other awards include the [[Champion Beer of Scotland]] and the [[Champion Beer of Wales]].

==National Beer Scoring Scheme==
CAMRA developed the &quot;National Beer Scoring Scheme&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=nbss
|title=National Beer Scoring Scheme
|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale
|date=12 January 2006

|accessdate=2009-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NBSS) as an easy to use scheme for judging beer quality in pubs, to assist CAMRA branches in selecting pubs for the ''Good Beer Guide''. The person filling in the form records their name, date, the pub, the beer and the score.
The scores range from 0, which signifies the beer is in such poor condition it cannot be drunk; through 2, which signifies an average beer that is drunk without calling attention to itself in either a positive or negative manner; up to 5, which signifies a perfect beer.

==Pub heritage group==
The &quot;CAMRA Pub Heritage Group&quot; is a group established to identify, record and help protect [[public house]] interiors of historic and/or architectural importance, and seeks to get them [[Listed building|listed]], if not already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://www.heritagepubs.org.uk
|title=Heritage Pubs - An Overview
|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale &lt;!-- black link i.e. same page --&gt;
|accessdate=2009-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group maintains two inventories of &quot;Heritage pubs&quot;, the National Inventory (NI), which contains only those pubs that have been maintained in their original condition (or have been modified very little) for at least 30 years, but usually since at least [[World War II]]. The second, larger inventory is the Regional Inventory (RI), which is broken down by [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] and contains both those pubs listed in the NI and other pubs that are not eligible for the NI, due to reasons such as having been overly modified, but are still considered historically important, or have particular architectural value.

The NI contains 289 pubs as of June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==LocAle==
With the main aims in mind, the group launched the ''LocAle'' scheme in 2007 which was developed by Steve Westby&lt;ref name=&quot;WB-Aug-Loc&quot;&gt;'' 'Check your beers urges LocAle creator' '', What's Brewing, August 2010 issue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WB-Sep-Loc&quot;/&gt; of the [[Nottingham]] branch&lt;ref name=&quot;LocAle1&quot;&gt;[http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=281398 CAMRA LocAle] (accessed 6 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; to help promote locally brewed beers and also helps with environmental issues. The scheme functions slightly differently in each area, and is managed by each branch, but the overall rule is that each participating pub is allowed to purchase beer from whatever brewery they wish, but if it the beer is to be promoted as a 'LocAle' it must come from a brewery within a predetermined number of miles (which is set by each CAMRA branch, but generally is around 20 or 25 miles,&lt;ref name=&quot;LocAle2&quot;&gt;[http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=281521 LocAle - More Information &amp; Downloads for Licensees] (accessed 6 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; although, the North [[London]] branch has set it at 30 miles&lt;ref name=&quot;CAM-NL-Loc&quot;&gt;[http://www.camranorthlondon.org.uk/locale.html CAMRA North London - LocAle] (accessed 6 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;) from brewery to pub door,&lt;ref name=&quot;WB-Sep-Loc&quot;&gt;'LocAle boosts local tourism', ''What's Brewing'', September 2010 issue&lt;/ref&gt; even if it comes from a distribution centre further away,&lt;ref name=&quot;LocAle2&quot;/&gt; in addition, each participating pub must keep at least one LocAle for sale at all times.&lt;ref name=&quot;LocAle2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAM-NL-Loc&quot;/&gt;

The '''CNO cycle''' (for [[carbon]]-[[nitrogen]]-[[oxygen]]), or sometimes '''Bethe-Weizsäcker-cycle''', is one of two sets of [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] [[nuclear reaction|reactions]] by which [[star]]s convert [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]], the other being the [[proton-proton chain]]. Unlike the proton-proton chain reaction, the CNO cycle is a [[catalytic cycle]]. Theoretical models show that the CNO cycle is the dominant source of energy in stars more massive  than about 1.3 times the mass of the [[sun]]. The proton-proton chain is more important in stars the mass of the sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reactions start occurring at temperatures around {{val|4|e=6|ul=K}}, making it the dominant force in smaller stars. The CNO chain starts occurring at approximately {{val|13|e=6|u=K}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, but its energy output rises much faster with increasing temperatures. At approximately {{val|17|e=6|u=K}}, the CNO cycle starts becoming the dominant source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;

In the CNO cycle, four [[proton]]s fuse, using carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes as a catalyst, to produce one [[alpha particle]], two [[positron]]s and two electron [[neutrino]]s. The positrons will almost instantly [[Electron-positron annihilation|annihilate]] with electrons, releasing energy in the form of [[gamma ray]]s. The neutrinos escape from the star carrying away some energy. The carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes are in effect one nucleus that goes through a number of transformations in an endless loop.

Like the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen involved in the main branch, the [[fluorine]] produced in the minor branch is merely catalytic and at steady state, does not accumulate in the star.

This subdominant branch is significant only for massive stars. The reactions are started when one of the reactions in CNO-II results in fluorine-18 and gamma instead of nitrogen-14 and alpha, and continues {{Nuclide2|oxygen|17|link=yes}}→{{Nuclide2|fluorine|18|link=yes}}→{{Nuclide2|oxygen|18|link=yes}}→{{Nuclide2|fluorine|19|link=yes}}→{{Nuclide2|oxygen|16|link=yes}}→{{Nuclide2|fluorine|17|link=yes}}→{{Nuclide2|oxygen|17}}:

== Use in astronomy ==
While the total number of &quot;catalytic&quot; CNO nuclei is conserved in the cycle, in [[stellar evolution]] the relative proportions of the nuclei are altered.  When the cycle is run to equilibrium, the ratio of the carbon-12/carbon-13 nuclei is driven to 3.5, and nitrogen-14 becomes the most numerous nucleus, regardless of initial composition.  During a star's evolution, convective mixing episodes bring material in which the CNO cycle has operated from the star's interior to the surface, altering the observed composition of the star.  [[Red giant]] stars are observed to have lower carbon-12/carbon-13 and carbon-12/nitrogen-14 ratios than [[main sequence]] stars, which is considered to be convincing evidence for the operation of the CNO cycle.

The presence of the heavier elements carbon, nitrogen and oxygen places an upper bound of approximately 150 solar masses on the maximum size of massive stars. It is thought{{Who|date=May 2010}} that the &quot;[[Metallicity|metal]]-poor&quot; early universe could have had stars, called [[Metallicity#Population_III_stars|Population III stars]], up to 250 solar masses without interference from the CNO cycle at the beginning of their lifetime.

'''Craps''' is a [[dice game]] in which players place [[gambling|wagers]] on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice. Players may [[wager]] money against each other (street craps, also known as shooting dice or rolling dice) or a bank ([[casino]] craps, also known as table craps).  Because it requires little equipment, street craps can be played in informal settings.

==History==
Craps developed from a simplification of the Old English game [[Hazard (game)|hazard]]. Its origins are complex and may date to the [[Crusades]], later being influenced by French gamblers.  What was to become the modern American version of the game was brought to [[New Orleans]] by [[Bernard de Marigny|Bernard Xavier Philippe de marigny de Mandeville]], [[kinship|scion]] of wealthy [[Louisiana]] landowners, a gambler, and politician.&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, Tyler, ''Bad Bet in the Bayou'' Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; There was a flaw in Bernard's version of the game in which players could exploit the casino using fixed dice and taking advantage of the way players can bet with or against the dice thrower. A man named John H. Winn introduced the &quot;don't pass&quot; betting option in order to fix this problem and it is this version of craps that still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lolcraps.com/craps/history/ The History of Craps]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game, first known as ''crapaud'' (a French word meaning &quot;toad&quot; in reference to the original style of play by people crouched over a floor or sidewalk), reportedly owes its modern popularity to street craps being spread through the [[African-American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury, ''Suckers progress; an informal history of gambling in America from the colonies to Canfield.'' New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; Street craps may be played by rolling the dice against a back-stop, such as a curb or stair-stoop, or without a back-stop, at the choice of the players.

During [[World War II]], street-style craps became popular among soldiers, who often played it using an Army blanket as a shooting surface. With no backboard or sidewalk curb to hit against, this gave rise to presumed methods of [[dice control]], of which the best was known as the &quot;army blanket roll&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamblingtimes.com/writers/jpatterson/jpatterson_fall2001.html GamblingTimes.com: Dice Control - Setting the Dice] by [[Jerry L. Patterson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern African American community, the game of street craps is generally called shooting dice, and is played on the floor or on a sidewalk, often without a back-stop. Among Black players, the name &quot;craps&quot; refers primarily to the casino version of the game that is played on a marked felt surface on a table.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-6091645-504083.html

==The rules of play against a bank or casino==
Bank craps is a game played by multiple players betting against a casino. Each casino might set slightly different payouts for the various bets. Players take turns rolling two [[dice]] and whoever is throwing the dice is called the &quot;shooter&quot;. Players can bet on the various options by placing chips in the appropriate sections of the board. It may be required to ask the dealer to place certain bets.

While acting as the shooter, a player must have a bet on the '''&quot;Pass&quot; line''' or the '''&quot;Don't Pass&quot; line'''. Pass and don’t pass are sometimes called &quot;Win&quot; or &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;Don’t Win&quot; or &quot;Wrong&quot; bets. The game is played in rounds and these &quot;Pass&quot; and &quot;Don't Pass&quot; bets are betting on the outcome of a round. The shooter is often replaced at the end of the round or when they lose a round with a seven. The dice are moved clockwise around the table for the next player to become shooter. The shooter is presented with multiple dice (typically five) by the &quot;stickman&quot;, and must choose two for the round. The remaining dice are returned to the stickman's bowl and are not used.

Each round has two phases: &quot;come-out&quot; and &quot;point&quot;.  To start a round, the shooter makes one or more &quot;come-out&quot; rolls.  A come-out roll of 2, 3 or 12 loses and is called &quot;craps&quot;. Anyone betting on the Pass line loses in this situation. A come-out roll of 7 or 11 (a &quot;natural&quot;) wins and results in a payout for &quot;pass line&quot; bets. The other possible numbers are the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls one of these numbers on the come-out roll, this establishes the '''&quot;point&quot;''' - the number that must be rolled again before a seven. The dealer flips a button to the &quot;On&quot; side and moves it to the point number signifying the second phase of the round. If the shooter rolls a seven before repeating the point number (a &quot;seven-out&quot;), the Pass line loses and the round ends.

===Joining a game===
A player wishing to play craps without being the shooter should approach the craps table and first check to see if the dealer's &quot;On&quot; button is on any of the point numbers.  If the button has been turned to &quot;Off&quot;, then the table is in the come-out round.  If the dealer's button is on, the table is in the point round where most casinos will allow a pass line bet to be placed, but the bet is placed straddling the outer border of the pass line so as to indicate that it is to be paid the same odds as a place bet, instead of just even money.  All single or multi roll proposition bets may be placed in either of the two rounds.  Between dice rolls there is a period for dealers to make payouts and collect losing bets, after which players can place new bets.  The stickman monitors the action at a table and decides when to give the shooter the dice, after which no more betting is allowed.

===The craps table===
In a casino, players make bets with chips on a specially made craps table with a table cloth made of felt that displays the various betting possibilities.  In most casinos, craps tables are double sided.  The layouts on both ends of the table are identical, with the center bets in the middle.  This allows more players to participate.  Players can make multiple bets for each turn, round, or roll and should become familiar with the craps layout.

A casino craps table is run by up to four casino employees: a '''boxman''' who guards the chips, supervises the dealers and handles &quot;coloring out&quot; players (exchanging small chip denominations for larger denominations in order to preserve the chips at a table); two '''base dealers''' who stand to either side of the boxman and collect and pay bets; and a '''stickman''' who stands directly across the table from the boxman, takes bets in the center of the table (hard ways, yo, craps, horn, etc.), announces the results of each roll, collects the dice with an elongated wooden stick, and directs the base dealers to pay winners from bets in the center of the table. Each employee makes sure the other is paying out winners correctly. Occasionally, during off-peak times, only one base dealer will be attending the table, rendering only half the table open for bettors or one of the two base dealers will assume the role of the stickman. In some casinos, there is no boxman; the boxman's duties are shared between the dealers and a roving supervisor who covers many tables.

In the game of shooting dice, there is no marked table and often the game is played with no back-stop against which the dice are to hit. (Despite the name &quot;street craps,&quot; this game is often played in houses, usually on an uncarpeted garage or kitchen floor.) The wagers are made in cash, never in chips, and are usually thrown down onto the ground by the players. There are no attendants, and so the progress of the game, fairness of the throws, and the way that the pay-outs are made for winning bets are self-policed by the players.

===Rolling===
The dealers will insist that the shooter roll with one hand and that the dice bounce off the far wall surrounding the table. These requirements are meant to keep the game fair (preventing switching the dice or making a &quot;controlled shot&quot;). If a die leaves the table, the shooter will usually be asked to select another die from the remaining three but can request using the same die if it passes the boxman's inspection. This requirement is used to keep the game fair (and reduce the chance of [[loaded dice]]).

{{Crapsrolls}}

There are many variants that are highly localized for the vocal calls made during a craps game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dicedealer.com/stick_calls.htm DiceDealer.com's list of calls made by the stick man]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dicedealer.com/xxx_stick_calls.htm DiceDealer.com's X-rated list of calls made by the stick man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknaming the rolls makes the game more interesting. Locals often have their own names.

Rolls of 4, 6, 8, and 10 are called &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; (e.g. &quot;Six the Hard Way&quot;, &quot;Easy Eight&quot;, &quot;Hard Ten&quot;) depending on whether they were rolled as a &quot;double&quot; or as any other combination of values, because of their significance in center table bets known as the &quot;hard ways&quot;.

'''Two''' is the proverbial &quot;Snake Eyes,&quot; because the two 1s that comprise it look like a pair of small, beady eyes. During actual play, more common terms are &quot;two craps two&quot; during the comeout roll because the pass line bet is lost on a comeout crap roll and/or because a bet on any craps would win.  &quot;Aces; DOUBLE the Field&quot; would be a more common call when not on the comeout roll to encourage Field Better to place subsequent bets and/or when no crap bets have been placed.  Another name for the two is &quot;Loose Deuce.&quot;

'''Three''' is typically called as &quot;Three craps Three&quot; during the comeout roll, or &quot;Three Ace Duece, come away single&quot; when not on the comeout to signify the come bet has been lost and to pay single on to any Field bettors.  Three may also be referred to as &quot;Ace Caught a Deuce,&quot; or even less often &quot;Acey Deucey.&quot;

'''Four '''(usually hard) is sometimes referred to as &quot;Little Joe from Kokomo.&quot; This is because in African American accents of the South, the word &quot;Four&quot; is generally pronounced &quot;Fo'&quot; -- hence &quot;Little Joe from Kokomo&quot; is [[rhyming slang]].

'''Five''' is often called &quot;No Field Five&quot; in casino craps because 5 is not on the Field and thus not paid in the Field bets. Other names for a Five are &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Little Phoebe.&quot;

'''Six''' may be referred to as &quot;Jimmie Hicks,&quot; &quot;Jimmy Hix,&quot; or &quot;Jimmie Hicks from the Sticks,&quot; all examples of rhyming slang.  On a win, the Six is often called &quot;666 winner 6&quot; followed by &quot;came hard&quot; or &quot;came easy.&quot;

'''Seven''' rolled as 6-1 is sometimes called &quot;Six Ace&quot; or &quot;Up Pops the Devil.&quot;  During the comeout, the seven is called &quot;seven, front line winner,&quot; frequently followed by &quot;pay the line&quot; and/or &quot;take the don'ts.&quot;  After the point is established, a seven is typically called by simply &quot;7 out&quot; or &quot;7 out 7.&quot;

'''Eight''' rolled the hard way, as opposed to an &quot;Easy Eight&quot; is sometimes called an &quot;Eighter from [[Decatur]]. It can also be known as a &quot;Square Pair,&quot; &quot;Mom and Dad,&quot; &quot;Ozzie and Harriet,&quot; or &quot;Eight the Hard&quot; followed by vague references of a sexual nature.

'''Nine''' is called a &quot;Centerfield Nine&quot;  in casino craps because 9 is in the center of the betting area called the Field. In Atlantic City, a 4-5 is called a &quot;Railroad Nine.&quot; The 4-5 Nine is also known as &quot;Jesse James&quot; because the outlaw [[Jesse James]] was killed by a 45 (4-5) caliber pistol. Other names for the nine include &quot;Nina from Pasadena,&quot; &quot;Nina at the Marina,&quot; and the &quot;Lou Brown,&quot;

'''Ten''' the hard way (5-5) is &quot;A Hard Ten&quot; or &quot;A Woman's Best Friend.&quot; This is both an example of rhyming slang and of a sexual [[double entendre]]. Ten may also be known as &quot;Puppy Paws&quot; or &quot;A Pair of Sunflowers.&quot;

'''Eleven''' is called out as &quot;Yo&quot; or &quot;Yo'Leven&quot; because it can often be mistaken for a seven; &quot;Yo&quot; is an attention-getting [[Expletive#Syntactic expletives|expletive]]. And older term for Eleven is &quot;Six Five, no Jive&quot; because it is a winning roll.  During the comeout, Eleven is typically followed by &quot;Front line Winner.&quot;  After the point is established, the subcall &quot;Good field and Come&quot; is often added.

'''Twelve''' is known as &quot;Boxcars&quot; because the spots on the two dice that show 6-6 look like schematic drawings of railroad [[boxcar]]s; it is also called &quot;Midnight,&quot; as in 12:00 am.  On tables that pay triple the field on a twelve roll, the stickman will often loudly exclaim &quot;TRIPLE&quot; either alone or in combination with &quot;12 craps 12&quot; or &quot;come away triple.&quot;

==Types of wagers==
===Line bets===
[[File:Craps_table_layout.svg|thumb|Standard layout for craps]]
The shooter is required to make either a Pass Line bet or a Don't Pass bet if he wants to shoot. Some casinos require all players to make a minimum Pass or Don't Pass bet whether they are currently shooting or not.

'''Pass line bet:'''
The fundamental bet in craps is the pass line bet, which is a bet for the shooter to win. A pass line bet is won immediately if the come-out roll is a 7 or 11. If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the bet loses (known as &quot;crapping out&quot;). If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point; if that point is rolled again before a seven, the bet wins. If, with a point established, a seven is rolled before the point is re-rolled (&quot;seven out&quot;), the bet loses. A pass line win pays even money.

'''Don't pass line bet:'''
A Don't pass line bet is a bet for the shooter to lose (shooter &quot;seven out, line away&quot;) and is almost the opposite of the pass line bet. The don't pass bet is opposite in that it loses if the come-out roll is 7 or 11 and wins if the come-out roll is 2 or 3. A 12 will draw (this depends on the casino— in some places a 12 will win and a 2 will draw); either way a player cannot lose if 12 is rolled. A draw, meaning a tie (the word &quot;BAR&quot;, printed on the Craps layout, means &quot;Standoff&quot;; it results in a tie), on 12 is done to ensure the casino maintains a house edge regardless of whether players are betting pass or don't pass. If a point is established and that point is rolled again, the don't pass bet loses. If a 7 is rolled instead of the point being re-rolled, the don't pass bet wins and is paid even money. There are two very slightly different ways to calculate the odds and house edge of this bet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crapsmath.com/craps_part_2.htm#two_views_of_no_pass A Craps Tutorial - Part 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The table below gives the numbers considering that the game ends in a push when a 12 is rolled, rather than being undetermined. Betting on don't pass is often called &quot;playing the dark side,&quot; and it is considered by some players to be in poor taste, or even taboo, because it goes directly against conventional play.

'''Pass odds:'''
If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the come-out roll (i.e., if a point is set), most casinos allow pass line bettors to take odds by placing from one to five times (and at some casinos, up to 100 times) the pass line bet behind the pass line.  This additional bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds of 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point, 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, and 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point.

Some casinos offer &quot;3-4-5X Odds,&quot; where the maximum allowed odds bet depends on the point (three times if the point is 4 or 10, four times on 5 or 9, and five times on 6 or 8). This rule simplifies the calculation of winnings: a maximum pass odds bet on a 3-4-5X table will always be paid at six times the pass line bet regardless of the point.

As odds bets are paid at true odds, in contrast with the pass line which is always even money, playing pass odds on a minimum pass line bet lessens the house advantage. A maximum odds bet on a minimum pass line bet often gives the lowest house edge available in the casino. However, the odds bet cannot be made independently, so the house retains an edge on the pass line bet itself.

'''Don't pass odds:'''
If a player is playing don't pass instead of pass, they may also lay odds by placing chips behind the don't pass line. If a 7 comes instead of the point coming, the odds pay at true odds of 1-to-2 if 4 or 10 is the point, 2-to-3 if 5 or 9 is the point, 5-to-6 if 6 or 8 is the point. At a 3-4-5x odds table, the maximum odds you lay will always be 6x the amount of the don't pass bet.

'''Come bet:'''
A come bet is played in two rounds and is played similar to a pass line bet.  The main difference is that a player making a come bet will bet on the first point number that &quot;comes&quot; from the shooters next roll, regardless of the table's round.  If a 7 or 11 is rolled on the first round, it wins. If a 2, 3 or 12 is rolled, it loses.  If instead the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 then the come bet will be moved by the base dealer onto a box representing the number the shooter threw.  This number becomes the &quot;come-bet point&quot; and the player is allowed to add odds to the bet.  The dealer will place the odds on top of the come bet, but slightly off center in order to differentiate between the original bet and the odds.  The second round wins if the shooter rolls the come bet point again before a seven. Winning come bets are paid the same as winning pass line bets - even money for the original bet and true odds for the odds bet.  If, instead, the seven is rolled before the come-bet point, the bet loses.

Come wagers can only be made '''''after''''' a point has been established. On a come out roll the come bet is placed on the pass line as they are an identical bet.

Because of the come bet, if the shooter makes their point, a player can find themselves in the situation where they have a come bet (possibly with odds on it) and the next roll is a come-out roll. In this situation, odds bets on the come wagers are presumed to be '''not working''' for the come-out roll. That means that if the shooter rolls a 7 on the come-out roll, any players with active come bets waiting for a come-bet point lose their initial wager but will have their odds bets returned to them.  If the come-bet point is rolled on the come-out roll, the odds do not win but the come bet does and the odds bet is returned (along with the come bet and its payoff). The player can tell the dealer that they want their odds '''working,''' such that if the shooter rolls a number that matches the come point, the odds bet will win along with the come bet, and if a seven is rolled, both lose.

'''Don't come bet:'''
A don't come bet is played in two rounds.  If a 2 or 3 is rolled in the first round, it wins. If a 7 or 11 is rolled, it loses.  If a 12 is rolled, it is a push.  If instead the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 then the don't come bet will be moved by the base dealer onto a box representing the number the shooter threw.  The second round wins if the shooter rolls a seven before the don't come point.

Don't come wagers can only be made '''''after''''' the come-out roll when a point has already been established.  Odds can also be placed on a don't come-bet just like a pass line bet; in this case the dealer (not the player) places the odds bet on top of the bet in the box, because of limited space, slightly offset to signify that it is an odds bet and not part of the original don't come bet.

Winning don't come bets are paid the same as winning don't pass bets - even money for the original bet and true odds for the odds lay.

===Single roll bets===
Single-roll (proposition) bets are resolved in one dice roll by the shooter. Most of these are called &quot;Service Bets&quot;, and they are located at the center of most craps tables. Only the stickman or a dealer can place a service bet.  The bets include:

'''2 (snake eyes, or Aces):''' Wins if shooter rolls a 2.

'''3 (ace-deuce):''' Wins if the shooter rolls a 3.

'''Yo:''' Wins if the shooter rolls 11.

'''12 (boxcars, midnight, or cornrows):''' Wins if shooter rolls a 12.

'''2 or 12 (hi-lo):''' Wins if shooter rolls a 2 or 12. The stickman places this bet on the line dividing the 2 and 12 bets.

'''Any Craps (Three-Way):''' Wins if the shooter rolls 2, 3 or 12.

'''C &amp; E:''' A combined bet, a player is betting half their bet on ''craps'' and the other half on ''yo'' (11). One of the two bets will always lose, the other may win.

'''Any seven:''' Wins if the shooter rolls a 7. This bet is also nicknamed ''Big Red,'' since the 7 on its betting space on the layout is usually large and red.

'''The Horn:''' This is a bet that involves betting on 1 unit each for 2, 3, 11 and 12 at the same time for the next roll. The bet is actually four separate bets, and pays off depending on which number is actually rolled, minus three units for the other three losing bets. Many players, in order to eliminate the confusion of tossing four chips to the center of the table or having change made while bets are being placed, will make a five-unit ''Horn High'' bet, which is a four-way bet with the extra unit going to one specific number. For example, if you toss a $5 chip into the center and say &quot;horn high yo,&quot; you are placing four $1 bets on each of the horn numbers and the extra dollar will go on the yo (11).

'''Whirl''' or '''World:''' bet is a five-unit bet that is a combination of a horn and any-seven bet, with the idea that if a seven is rolled the bet is a push, because the money won on the seven is lost on the horn portions of the bet.

'''On the Hop'''  This is a single roll bet on any particular combination of the two dice on the next roll.  For example, if you bet on &quot;5 and 1&quot; on the hop, you are betting that the next roll will have a 5 on one die and a 1 on the other die. The bet pays 15:1 (just like a bet on 3 or 11) except for doubles (e.g., 3 and 3 on the hop) which pay 30:1 (just like a bet on 12, which is the same as 6 and 6 on the hop).  The true odds are 17:1 and 35:1, resulting in a house edge of 11.11% and 13.89% respectively. When presented, hop bets are located at the center of the craps layout with the other proposition bets.  If hop bets are not on the craps layout, they still may be bet on by players but they become the responsibility of the boxman to book the bet.

'''Field:''' This bet is a wager that one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 will appear on the next roll of the dice. This bet typically pays more (2:1 or 3:1) if 2 or 12 is rolled, and 1:1 if 3, 4, 9, 10 or 11 is rolled.
The Field bet is a &quot;Self-Service&quot; Bet. Unlike the other proposition bets which are handled by the dealers or stickman, the field bet is placed directly by the player. Players identify their Field bets by placing them in the Field area directly in front of them or as close to their position as possible. The initial bet and/or any payouts can &quot;ride&quot; through several rolls until they lose, and are assumed to be &quot;riding&quot; by dealers. It is thus the player's responsibility to collect their bet and/or winnings immediately upon payout, before the next dice roll, if they do not wish to let it ride.

===Multi-roll bets===
These are bets that may not be settled on the first roll and may need any number of subsequent rolls before an outcome is determined.
Most multi-roll bets may fall into the situation where a point is made by the shooter before the outcome of the multi-roll bet is decided. These bets are considered &quot;not working&quot; in the new come-out roll until the next point is established, unless the player calls the bet as &quot;working.&quot; Casino rules vary on this; some of these bets may not be callable, while others may be considered &quot;working&quot; during the come-out. If a non-working point number placed, bought or laid becomes the new point as the result of a come-out, the bet is usually refunded, or can be moved to another number for free.

'''Hard way:''' A bet that the shooter will throw a 4, 6, 8 or 10 the &quot;hard way&quot;, before he throws a seven or the corresponding &quot;easy way&quot;. A hard way is when both dice show identical values, also known as &quot;doubles&quot; or &quot;pairs&quot;, so 2-2 is hard way 4.

'''Easy way:''' Opposite of hard way is a bet that the shooter will throw a specific easy way (either 4, 6, 8 or 10), before he throws a seven. An easy way is a value that does not have two dice identical, so 3-1 is easy way 4. These are rarely available as bets except by placing on a point number (which pays off on easy or hard rolls of that number).

'''Big 6''' and '''Big 8:''' A player can choose either the 6 or 8 being rolled before the shooter throws a seven. These wagers are usually avoided by experienced craps players since they pay [[even money]] (1:1) while a player can make place bets on the 6 or the 8, which pay more (7:6).  Some casinos do not even offer the Big 6 &amp; 8. The bets are located in the corners behind the pass line, and bets may be placed directly by players.

'''Place and buy:'''
Players can place or buy any point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) by placing their wager in the come area and telling the dealer how much and on what number(s), &quot;30 on the 6&quot;, &quot;5 on the 5&quot; or &quot;25 buy the 10&quot;. Both place and buy bets are bets that the number bet on will be rolled before a 7 is rolled. These bets are considered working bets, and will continue to be paid out each time a shooter rolls the place or buy point number. By rules, place bets are NOT working on the come out roll but can be &quot;turned on&quot; by the player.

Place bets are paid at odds slightly worse than the true odds.
The place bets on the outside numbers (4,5,9,10) should be made in units of $5, (on a $5 minimum table), in order to receive the correct exact payout of $5 paying $7 or $5 paying $9. The place bets on the 6 &amp; 8 should be made in units of $6, (on a $5 minimum table), in order to receive the correct exact payout of $6 paying $7.

Buy bets are paid at true odds, but a 5% commission is charged on the amount of the bet. Traditionally, the buy bet commission is paid no matter what, but in recent years a number of casinos have changed their policy to charge the commission only when the buy bet wins. Some casinos charge the commission as a one-time fee to buy the number; payouts are then always at true odds. Most casinos usually charge only $1 for a $25 green-chip bet (4% commission), or $2 for $50 (two green chips), reducing the house advantage a bit more. Where commission is charged only on wins, the commission is often deducted from the winning payoff—a winning $25 buy bet on the 10 would pay $49, for instance. The house edges stated in the table assume the commission is charged on all bets. They are reduced by at least a factor of two if commission is charged on winning bets only. Rarely casinos offer the place bet to lose. This bet is the opposite of the place bet and wins if a 7 is rolled before the specific point number. The place bet to lose typically carries a lower house edge than a place bet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craps-casinos.com/how-to-play-craps/types-of-bets/#place-lose  Types of Craps Bets]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lay:'''
A lay bet is the opposite of a buy bet, where a player bets on a 7 to roll before the number that is laid. Just like the buy bet lay bets pay true odds, but because the lay bet is the opposite of the buy bet, the payout is reversed. Therefore players get 1 to 2 for the numbers 4 and 10, 2 to 3 for the numbers 5 and 9, and 5 to 6 for the numbers 6 and 8. A 5% commission (vigorish, vig, juice) is charged up front on the possible winning amount. For example: A $40 Lay Bet on the 4 would pay $20 on a win. The 5% vig would be $1 based on the $20 win. (NOT $2 based on the $40 bet as the way buy bet commissions are figured.) Like the buy bet the commission is adjusted to suit the betting unit such that fraction of a dollar payouts are not needed.

===Player bets===
'''Fire Bet:''' Before the shooter begins, some casinos will allow a bet known as a fire bet to be placed.  A fire bet is a bet of as little as 1 dollar, made in the hope that the next shooter will have a hot streak of setting and getting many points of different values. As different individual points are made by the shooter, they will be marked on the craps layout with a fire symbol.  The first three points will not pay out on the fire bet, but the fourth, fifth and sixth will pay out at increasing odds. The fourth point pays at 24-to-1, the fifth point pays at 249-to-1 and the 6th point pays at 999-to-1.  Note that the points must all be different numbers for them to count towards the fire bet.  For example, a shooter who successfully hits a point of 10 twice will only garner credit for the first one on the fire bet.

The probability of dice combinations determine the odds of the payout.  The following chart shows the dice combinations needed to roll each number.  The two and twelve are the hardest to roll since only one combination of dice is possible.  The game of craps is built around the dice roll of seven, since it is the most easily rolled dice combination.

The [[expected value]] of all bets is negative, such that the average player will always lose money. This is because the house always sets the paid odds to below the actual odds. The only exception is the &quot;odds&quot; bet that the player is allowed to make after a point is established on a pass/come don't pass/don't come bet (the odds portion of the bet has a long-term expected value of 0). However, the &quot;free odds&quot; bet cannot be made independently, so the expected value of the entire bet, including odds, is still negative.  Since there is no correlation between die rolls, there is no possible long-term winning strategy in craps.

Maximizing the size of the odds bet in relation to the line bet will reduce, but never eliminate the house edge, and will increase [[variance]].  Many casinos have a limit on how large the odds bet can be in relation to the flat bet, with single, double, and five times odds common.  Some casinos offer 3-4-5 odds, referring to the maximum multiple of the line bet a player can place in odds for the points of 4 and 10, 5 and 9, and 6 and 8, respectively.  During promotional periods, a casino may even offer 100x odds bets, which reduces the house edge to almost nothing, but dramatically increases variance, as the player will be betting in large betting units.

Since several of the multiple roll bets pay off in ratios of fractions on the dollar, it is important that the player bets in multiples that will allow a correct payoff in complete dollars. Normally, payoffs will be rounded down to the nearest dollar, resulting in a higher house advantage. These bets include all place bets, taking odds, and buying on numbers 6, 8, 5, and 9, as well as laying all numbers.

== Betting variants ==
These variants depend on the casino and the table, and sometimes a casino will have different tables that use or omit these variants and others.

* 11 is a point number instead of a natural. Rolling an 11 still pays &quot;Yo&quot; center-table bets, but the Pass line does not automatically win (and the Don't Pass line doesn't automatically lose) when 11 is rolled on the come-out. Making the point pays 3:1 on Pass/Come odds bets (1:3 on Don't Pass/Come odds); all line bets are still even money. This slightly reduces the odds of a natural and of making the point in general. All other things equal, the house edge on the Pass Line and Come bets for this play variation jumps dramatically to 9.75%.

* 12 pays 3:1 on the field. This is generally seen in rooms that have two different table minimums, on the tables with the higher minimums. The lower minimum ones will then have 2:1 odds.

* 11 pays 2:1 on the field. This variant is normally used when 12 pays 3:1, and neutralizes the house edge on the field.

* Big 6/8 are unavailable. These bets are equivalent to placing or buying 6 or 8 as points, which have better payout for the same real odds, so Big 6/8 are rarely used and many casinos simply omit them from the layout. Casinos in Atlantic City are even prohibited by law from offering Big 6/8 bets.

== Optimal betting==
Since all bets have a house advantage, and a negative expected value, the optimal strategy is to be the house. Failing that, one can reduce one's average losses by only placing bets with the smallest house advantage.

The pass/don't line, come/don't line, place 6, place 8, buy 4 and buy 10 (only under the casino rules where commission is charged only on wins) are the best bets with the lowest house edge in the casino, and all other bets will on average lose money between three and twelve times faster because of the difference in house edges.

The place bets and buy bets differ from the pass/don't line and come/don't line, in that place bets and buy bets can be removed at any time, since, while they are multi-roll bets, their odds of winning do not change from roll to roll,  whereas pass/don't line bets and come/don't line bets are a combination of different odds on their first roll and subsequent rolls. Note that you ''can'' generally take back (pick up) a don't pass or don't come bet after the first roll, but you ''shouldn't'', because you already endured the disadvantaged part of the combination - the first roll. On that come-out roll, you win just 3 (1-1, 1-2, 2-1) out of 36 possible rolls, while losing on 8 (6 7s, 2 11s) (2.6:1 against). On the other 24 rolls that become a point (push on the 1 12), your don't pass bet is now a favorite of between 2:1 (on points 4 and 10) and 6:5 (on points 6 and 8). It's no wonder that they will gladly allow you to take down such a bet.

Similarly, the first roll of a pass-line bet is 2:1 advantage for the player (8 wins, 4 losses), but it's &quot;paid for&quot; by subsequent rolls that are at the same disadvantage to the player as the don't pass bets were at an advantage. As such, they cannot profitably let you take down the bet after the first the roll.

Among these, and the remaining numbers and possible bets, there are a myriad of systems and progressions that can be used with many combinations of numbers.

An important alternative metric is house advantage per roll (rather than per bet), which may be expressed in loss per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;wizardofodds.com&quot;&gt;http://wizardofodds.com/craps&lt;/ref&gt; The typical pace of rolls varies depending on the number of players, but 102 rolls per hour is a cited rate for a nearly full table.&lt;ref name=&quot;wizardofodds.com&quot;/&gt; This same reference states that only &quot;29.6% of total rolls are come out rolls, on average,&quot; so for this alternative metric, needing extra rolls to resolve the pass line bet, for example, is factored. This number then permits calculation of rate of loss per hour, and per the 4 day/5 hour per day gambling trip:{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Etiquette==
Besides the rules of the actual game, certain unwritten rules of etiquette exist while playing craps and are expected to be followed. Many consider these guidelines as important as the actual rules themselves. New players should familiarize themselves with them before approaching a craps table.

=== Rules related to casino security ===
Players are not supposed to handle the dice with more than one hand (such as shaking them in cupped hands before rolling) nor take the dice past the edge of the table. The only way to change hands when throwing dice, if permitted at all, is to set the dice on the table, let go, then take them with the other hand. This reduces or eliminates the possibility of the shooter switching dice by [[sleight-of-hand]].

When throwing the dice, the player is expected to hit the farthest wall at the opposite end of the table. Some casinos refer to throws that do not hit the opposite wall as &quot;Mellenberg Rolls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlinecasinoreports.com/school/gamesoverview/craps.php&lt;/ref&gt; Most casinos will allow a roll that does not hit the opposite wall as long as the dice are thrown past the middle of the table. Occasionally a short roll will be called a &quot;no roll&quot; due to the more controllable nature of such a roll. The dice may not be slid across the table and must be tossed. Typically, players are asked not to throw the dice higher than the eye level of the dealers.

Dice are considered &quot;in play&quot; if they land on players' bets on the table, the dealer's working stacks, on the marker puck or with one die resting on top of the other. The roll is invalid if either or both dice land in the boxman's bank, the stickman's bowl (where the extra three dice are kept between rolls), or in the rails around the top of the table where players chips are kept. If a die or both dice leave the table, it is also a &quot;no roll&quot; and the boxman will examine the dice before letting them come back into the game. However, the player may request the same die or dice.

When either of the dice land on or come to rest leaning against chips, markers, or the side of the table, the number that would be on top if the object the die is leaning on were removed, is the number that is used to make the call.

If one or both dice hits a player or dealer and rolls back onto the table, the roll counts as long as the person being hit did not interfere with either of the dice, though some casinos will rule &quot;no roll&quot; for this situation.

In most casinos the shooter may &quot;set&quot; the dice to a particular starting configuration before throwing (such as showing a particular number or combination, stacking the dice, or spacing them to be picked up between different fingers), but if they do, they are often asked to be quick about it so as not to delay the game. Some casinos have &quot;no setting&quot; rules.

Dealers are not allowed to touch the players or hand chips directly to a player, and vice versa.  If &quot;buying in&quot; (paying cash for chips) at the table, players are expected to lay the cash down on the layout, which the dealer will take and then place chips in front of the player.

Some crap table layouts state &quot;No Call Bets.&quot; A call bet is made when a player is allowed to make a bet without first placing the necessary chips in the right spot on the table. This might occur while a player is waiting for a marker (casino credit) to arrive, or after the dice have left the center of the table (after which time the players must usually remove their hands from the playing surface).

The casino may ask a player to leave the table or the casino for any reason.

=== Commonly observed etiquette ===

It is generally preferable to place chips on the board rather than tossing them. Tossed chips may roll on edge out of the dealer's reach and/or upset other stacks of chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextshooter.com/etiquette Craps Etiquette... and its effect on winning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A center bet, controlled by the stickman (usually the hardest person to reach) can be made by passing chips to the nearest dealer, who will relay the bet to the stickman. When chips must be tossed it is polite to gain the dealer or stickman's attention and toss as few chips as necessary to cover the bet (a $25 chip is preferable to a stack of five $5 chips).

When offered the dice to shoot, a player may pass the dice to the next player without fear of offending anyone; however, at least one player must always be a &quot;shooter&quot; betting on either the pass line or don't pass line for the game to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wizardofodds.com/craps ♠Craps - Strategy and Odds by The Wizard of Odds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When tipping, the most common way is simply to toss chips onto the table and say, &quot;For the dealers&quot; or &quot;For the boys&quot; (the second is considered acceptable even though dealers often are women). It's also common to place a bet for the dealers. If the bet is one handled by the dealers, such as a Place bet or one of the proposition bets handled by the stick-man, the chip(s) should be placed, or thrown, and announced as a dealer bet, such as &quot;Dealer's hard eight&quot;, or &quot;Place the eight for the dealers&quot;. A &quot;two-way&quot; bet is one that is part for the player and part for the dealers. Usually, the dealers' bet is smaller than the player's bet, but it is appreciated. The part of the bet for the dealer is called a &quot;toke&quot; bet; this is from the $1 slot machine coins or tokens that are sometimes used to place bets for the dealers in a casino. Most casinos require the dealers to pick up their winning bets, including the original tip, rather than &quot;let it ride&quot; as the player may choose to do. If the player wants the original dealer bet to remain in place, the phrase ''&quot;I control the bet&quot;'' should be clearly stated by the tipper, and acknowledged by the one of the crew, immediately upon announcing the dealer bet. This indicates that any winnings for that bet will be picked up by the dealers, and the original amount will remain in play until cleared by a loss or retracted by the player after a win (such as a single-roll bet that would normally be returned to the player with their winnings).

The $1 &quot;yo&quot; (eleven) bet, split with the dealers on come-out rolls by calling out &quot;two-way yo,&quot; tends to be a favorite with many players as means of tipping the dealers without giving up too much per gambling trip. If eleven comes out on the come out roll, the pass line win bets and the more substantial &quot;yo&quot; bet splits (see [http://wizardofodds.com/askthewizard/190 see reference]).

After the come-out roll, it is considered bad luck to say the word &quot;seven&quot;. A common &quot;nickname&quot; for this number is &quot;Big Red&quot;, or just &quot;Red&quot;.

It is considered bad luck to change dice in the middle of a roll. If one or both dice leave the table during a roll, and the shooter does not want a new die (or dice) substituted into the game, the shooter should immediately and clearly call ''&quot;Same Dice!&quot;''. The retrieved die (or dice) will then be returned to play after close inspection by the boxman. To speed play, most casinos will immediately begin the process of introducing new dice unless the shooter has requested otherwise, though some casinos will inspect and return the dice by default.

Proposition bets, the bets in the center of the table, are made by tossing chips to the center of the table and calling out the intended bet; the stickman will then place the chips correctly for the player. As mentioned above, care should be taken when tossing chips. Players furthest from the stickman can often elect to place a center bet with a dealer who will relay the bet to the center.

It is considered rude to &quot;late bet,&quot; or make wagers while the dice are no longer in the middle of the table. While entirely permissible, excessive late betting will generally garner a warning as it slows play. At the discretion of the boxman or a &quot;pit boss&quot;, dealers can disallow a bet made after the dice have left the center.

Food, drinks, cigarettes, and other items should remain off the chip rail and should not be held over the table.

Players feel it is bad luck for the shooter to leave the table after a successful come-out roll. A shooter retains the right to roll and is expected to continue rolling until he or she sevens out. If the shooter leaves the game before a decision is reached on a point number, the dice will be passed to the next player to continue where the shooter left off. Once a decision is reached, the &quot;substitute&quot; shooter can, at the discretion of the boxman, continue to roll the dice for a new &quot;come out&quot; as would have been the case had the previous shooter completed their roll.

When the shooter is ready to roll, players should remove their hands from the table area in order to avoid interfering with the dice.  The stickman will often say &quot;hands high, let 'em fly&quot; or &quot;dice are out, hands high&quot;.

When making bets in the field or on the Big 6 or Big 8, it is the player's responsibility to track his or her bet.  Place bets and Come Line bets will be tracked by the dealer, who will pay the player directly.  Hardway and other proposition bets are tracked by the stickman and will be paid by the dealer to the player directly based on instructions from the stickman.

The phrase “[[barber pole]]” is derisive jargon in craps, and refers to the commingling of “gaming cheques of different denominations.” Wagers that combine different denominations are “supposed to be stacked with the highest denomination at the bottom. “&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dicedealer.com/craps_lingo.htm ''Craps Jargon, Slang, Dialect, Lingo'' at dicedealer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems ==
=== Martingale system ===
No wagering system can consistently beat casino games of pure chance such as craps, but that does not stop hopeful gamblers believing in them. One of the best known systems is the [[Martingale (betting system)|Martingale System]], in which the player starts by betting a given amount, for instance $1, and doubles his bet whenever he loses. Upon winning, he starts over at the initial amount. The idea is to realize a net win equal to the initial amount after every eventual win.  This system fails because the player will either run out of money after having to double his bet several times in a row after a streak of losing bets, or he will be unable to bet the amount dictated by the system because it would exceed the maximum bet allowed by the casino. The Martingale system also only yields a profit equal to the initial bet amount every time the player wins. If the initial amount is small, the payout from each Martingale sequence will be just as small.

=== Gambler's fallacy ===
Other systems depend on the [[gambler's fallacy]], which in craps terms is the belief that past dice rolls influence the probabilities of future dice rolls. For example, the gambler's fallacy indicates that a craps player should bet on eleven if an eleven has not appeared or has appeared too often in the last 20 rolls.

In reality, each roll of the dice is an [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] event, so the probability of rolling eleven is exactly 1/18 on every roll, regardless of the number of times eleven has come up in the last x rolls. Even if the dice are actually biased toward particular results (&quot;loaded&quot;), each roll is still independent of all the previous ones. The common term to describe this is &quot;dice have no memory&quot;.

=== Parity hedge system ===
The parity hedge system is a [[hoax]] promulgated by [[Quatloos.com|Quatloos]]. Despite the fact that no such system exists (indeed, it is a mathematical impossibility), several gambling-related web sites have retold the 'parity hedge' story without attribution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Dice setting or dice control===
{{Main|Dice control}}
Another approach is to &quot;set&quot; the dice in a particular orientation, and then throw them in such a manner that they do not tumble randomly.  The theory is that the dice, given the same throw from the same starting configuration, will tumble in the same way and therefore show the same or similar values every time.  Unlike other systems, this one is mathematically plausible, because if it were possible to alter the probabilities of each outcome, then winning systems could be devised.

Casinos do take steps to prevent this. The dice are usually required to hit the back wall of the table, which is normally faced with a angular texture such as diamonds, making controlled spins more difficult. Whether it is possible for human beings to consistently exercise the precise physical control necessitated by the theory is a source of controversy.  A small but dedicated community of controlled shooters maintain records and claim proof of dice influencing in casino conditions. [[Frank Scoblete]], [[Stanford Wong]] and [[Jerry L. Patterson]], authors of books that feature dice control techniques, believe that it is possible to alter the odds in the player's favor by dice control.

Chris Pawlicki, a mechanical engineer who (under the pseudonym &quot;Sharpshooter&quot;) wrote a book on dice setting called ''Get The Edge At Craps: How to Control the Dice'' as a part of the Frank Scoblete &quot;Get the Edge Guides,&quot; defined the math and science behind dice control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readybetgo.com/book-reviews/review-315.html  Math Behind why Dice Control Works]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some people offer to teach dice-setting skills for a substantial fee.  Currently there has been no independent conclusive evidence that such methods can be successfully applied in a real casino.

==Variants of the game==
Bank craps is a variation of the original craps game and is sometimes known as Las Vegas Craps. This variant is quite popular in Nevada gambling houses, however its availability online has now made it a globally played game. Bank craps uses a special table layout and all bets must be made against the house. In Bank Craps, the dice are thrown over a wire or a string that is normally stretched a few inches from the table’s surface. The lowest house edge (for the pass/don't pass) in this variation is around 1.4%. Generally, if the word &quot;craps&quot; is used without any modifier, it can be inferred to mean this version of the game, to which most of this article refers.

Crapless Craps, also known as Bastard Craps is a simple version of the original craps game, and is normally played as an online private game. The biggest difference between crapless craps and original craps, is that the shooter (person throwing the dice) is at a far greater disadvantage and has a house edge of 5.38%. Another difference is that this is one of the craps games in which a player can bet on rolling a 2, 3, 11 or 12 before a 7 is thrown. In crapless craps, 2 and 12 have odds of 11:2 and have a house edge of 7.143% while 3 and 11 have odds of 11:4 with a house edge of 6.25%.

Die Rich Craps, also known as Fading Craps, Open Craps, or Money Craps is a more recent version of the craps game, and is played using a single die. These variants are usually considered to be games involving big money, and are most commonly played in private. Die Rich Craps involves specific bets made against the book. The book keeps a specific percentage of the total amount of money wagered (5%-7%) and this is called vigorish. In the online and offline gambling circuits, this variation of craps is considered an illegal game{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The craps table in this variant will always consist of a Win Line, Lose Line, and box numbers of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10.

High Point Craps is another version of the original Craps game. The initial roll of a 2 or a 3 in High Point Craps is ignored. If a player rolls a 2 then the player will roll again. If a player rolls 11 or 12, the player wins. Any other total rolled, is considered as 1 point and the player rolls again. This time needing to roll a total that is higher than 11 or 12 to win. The house edge in this craps game variation is 2.35%.

New York Craps is one of the variations of craps played mostly in the Eastern coast of the USA, true to its name. History states that this game was actually found and played in casinos in Yugoslavia, the UK and the Bahamas. In this craps variant, the house edge is greater than Las Vegas Craps or Bank craps. The table layout is also different, and is called a double-end-dealer table. This variation is different from the original craps game in several ways, but the primary difference is that New York craps doesn’t allow Come or Don’t Come bets. New York Craps Players bet on box numbers like 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10. The overall house edge in New York craps is 5%.

Simplified Craps is a variation that can be won by rolling 2, 3, 4, 10, 11 or 12, but if a 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 is rolled, the player loses. Simplified Craps has an overall house edge of 2.8%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crapsonline.com/craps-guide/craps-games.html Craps Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Card-based variations==
In order to get around California laws barring the payout of a game being directly related to the roll of dice, Indian reservations have adapted the game to insert cards into the process.

===Cards replacing dice===
In one variation, there are no dice at all. Two shoes are used, each containing some number of regular card decks that have been stripped down to just the Aces and deuces through sixes. The boxman simply deals one card from each shoe and that is the roll on which bets are settled. Since a card-counting scheme is easily devised to make use of the information of cards that have already been dealt, a relatively small portion (less than 50%) of each shoe is usually dealt in order to protect the house.

In a similar variation, cards representing dice are dealt directly from a continuous [[shuffling machine]] (CSM).  Typically, the CSM will hold approximately 264 cards, or 44 sets of 1 thru 6 spot cards.  Two cards are dealt from the CSM for each roll. The game is played exactly as regular craps, but the roll distribution of the remaining cards in the CSM is slightly skewed from the normal symmetric distribution of dice.  Even if the dealer were to shuffle each roll back into the CSM, the effect of buffering a number of cards in the chute of the CSM provides information about the skew of the next roll.  Analysis shows this type of game is biased towards the don't pass and don't come bets.  A player betting don't pass and don't come every roll and laying 10x odds receives a 2% profit on the initial don't pass / don't come bet each roll{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. Using a counting system allows the player to attain a similar return at lower variance.

===Cards mapping physical dice===
In this game variation, one red deck and one blue deck of six cards each (A through 6), and a red die and a blue die are used. Each deck is shuffled separately, usually by machine. Each card is then dealt onto the layout, into the 6 red and 6 blue numbered boxes. The shooter then shoots the dice. The red card in the red-numbered box corresponding to the red die, and the blue card in the blue-numbered box corresponding to the blue die are then turned over to form the roll on which bets are settled.

Another variation uses a red and a blue deck of 36 custom playing cards each. Each card has a picture of a two-die roll on it - from 1-1 to 6-6. The shooter shoots what looks like a red and a blue die, called &quot;cubes&quot;. They are numbered such that they can never throw a pair, and that the blue one will show a higher value than the red one exactly half the time. One such scheme could be 222555 on the red die and 333444 on the blue die. One card is dealt from the red deck and one is dealt from the blue deck. The shooter throws the &quot;cubes&quot; and the color of the cube that is higher selects the color of the card to be used to settle bets. On one such table, an additional one-roll prop bet was observed. If the card that was turned over was either 1-1 or 6-6, the other card was also turned over. If it was the &quot;opposite&quot; (6-6 or 1-1, respectively) of the first card, the prop bet paid 500:1.

==The rules of play against other players==
Recreational or informal playing of craps outside of a casino is referred to as ''street craps'' or ''private craps''.  The most notable difference between playing street craps and [[bank]] craps is that there is no bank or house to cover bets in street craps.  Players must bet against each other by covering or ''fading'' each others bets for the game to be played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winneronline.com/articles/october2003/the-history-of-craps.html The History Of Craps] by Meaghan Hutton&lt;/ref&gt;  If money is used instead of chips and depending on the laws of where it is being played, street craps can be an illegal form of gambling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crapstablefun.com/craps-private.shtml Private Craps]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of street craps.  The simplest way is to either agree on or roll a number as the point, then roll the point again before you roll a seven.  Unlike more complex [[proposition bet]]s offered by casinos, street craps has more simplified betting options.  The shooter is required to make either a ''Pass'' or a ''Don't Pass'' bet if he wants to roll the dice.  Another player must choose to cover the shooter to create a stake for the game to continue.  If there are several players, the rotation of the player who must cover the shooter may change with the shooter (comparable to a blind in [[poker]]).  The person covering the shooter will always bet '''against''' the shooter.  For example, if the shooter made a &quot;Pass&quot; bet, the person covering the shooter would make a &quot;Don't Pass&quot; bet to win.  Once the shooter is covered, other players may make Pass/Don't Pass bets, or any other proposition bets, as long as there is another player willing to cover.

'''Carl Philipp Gottfried von Clausewitz'''&lt;ref name=von /&gt; ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|l|aʊ|z|ə|v|ɪ|t|s}}; June 1, 1780 – November 16, 1831&lt;ref name=bassford&gt;Bassford, Christopher. (2002). [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/Bassford/Cworks/Works.htm &quot;Clausewitz and his Works&quot;] Clausewitz.com. Retrieved 2007-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Prussia]]n soldier and German military theorist who stressed the moral and political aspects of [[war]]. His most notable work, ''[[On War|Vom Kriege]]'' (''On War''), was unfinished at his death.

Clausewitz espoused a [[romanticism|romantic]] conception of warfare, though he also had at least one foot planted firmly in the more rationalist ideas of the European [[Age_of_Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He stressed the [[dialectic]] of how opposite factors interact, and noting how unexpected new developments unfolding under the &quot;[[fog of war]]&quot; called for rapid decisions by alert commanders. Clausewitz saw history as a complex check on abstractions that did not accord with experience. In opposition to [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]] he argued war could not be quantified or graphed or reduced to mapwork and graphs.  Clausewitz had many aphorisms, of which the most famous is, &quot;War is not merely a political act, but also a political instrument, a continuation of political relations, a carrying out of the same by other means,&quot; a working definition of war which has won wide acceptance.

==Name==
Clausewitz's Christian name is sometimes given in non-German sources as ''Carl Philipp Gottlieb'', ''Carl Maria'', or misspelled ''Karl'' due to reliance on mistaken source material, conflations with his wife's name, Marie, or mistaken assumptions about German [[orthography]].  ''Carl Philipp Gottfried'' appears on Clausewitz's tombstone and is thus most likely to be the correct version.&lt;ref&gt;There is no single &quot;correct&quot; spelling for German names before the early 19th century.  Vital records were kept by pastors in their parish records.  Different pastors used different spellings and commonly ignored how their predecessor may have spelled the same name.  The name of the same individual can be found with different spellings in the same parish record, for example, if one pastor registered his birth and a different one his marriage or his death.  It appears that pastors recorded names as they heard them and spelled them as they believed they should be spelled.   Pastors treated persons of importance or high status such as nobility or civil or military officials more deferentially.  For the names of such persons it can make sense to distinguish between such spellings as &quot;Carl&quot; or &quot;Karl&quot; even then.  The situation changed radically in the Napoleonic era when French civil servants introduced greater discipline in keeping vital records in German lands.  Spellings of family and given names were &quot;frozen&quot; in whatever state they happened to be in then.  It was, however, not unusual for brothers who made their homes in different parishes to have their family names spelled differently.  Such variations endure to this day and confound amateur genealogists who are not familiar with the fluidity of German spellings before the Napoleonic reforms.  While spellings of names were fluid when Clausewitz was born, they had become firm by the time of his death.  That is why it makes sense to accept the spelling of his name as recorded on his tombstone which, presumably, agrees with the vital records of his death.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tombstone reads:

==Life and military career==
Clausewitz was born on June 1, 1780 in [[Burg bei Magdeburg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the fourth and youngest son of a lower middle-class family. His grandfather, the son of a [[Lutheran]] pastor, had been a professor of theology. Clausewitz's father was once a lieutenant in the [[Prussian army]] and held a minor post in the Prussian internal revenue service. Clausewitz entered the Prussian military service at the age of twelve as a [[Lance-Corporal]], eventually attaining the rank of [[Major-General]].&lt;ref name=onwar&gt;{{cite web | title=Full copy of On War | url=http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/TOC.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausewitz served in the [[First Coalition|Rhine Campaign]]s (1793–1794) e.g. the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]], when the [[Prussian army]] invaded France during the [[French Revolution]], and later served in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1806 to 1815.  Clausewitz entered the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]'' in Berlin (also cited variously as &quot;The German War School,&quot; the &quot;Military Academy in Berlin,&quot; and the &quot;Prussian Military Academy&quot;) in 1801 (age 21 years), studied the writings of the [[philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]], and won the regard of General [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], the future first chief of staff of the new Prussian Army (appointed 1809).  Clausewitz, along with [[Hermann von Boyen]] (1771&amp;ndash;1848) and [[Karl von Grolman]] (1777&amp;ndash;1843), were Scharnhorst's primary allies in his efforts to reform the Prussian army between 1807 and 1814.

[[File:Marievonclausewitz.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Marie von Clausewitz]]

Clausewitz served during the Jena Campaign as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia|Prince August]]. At the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]] on October 14, 1806 &amp;ndash; when Napoleon invaded Prussia and defeated the massed Prussian-Saxon army commanded by [[Charles William Ferdinand|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand]], [[Duke of Brunswick]] &amp;ndash; he was captured, one of the 25,000 prisoners captured that day as the Prussian army disintegrated.  He was twenty-six at the time.

Clausewitz was held prisoner in [[France]] from 1807 to 1808. Returning to Prussia, he assisted in the reform of the Prussian army and state. He also married the socially prominent [[Countess]] [[Marie von Brühl]] and socialized with Berlin's literary and intellectual elite.  Opposed to Prussia's enforced alliance to Napoleon, he left the Prussian army and subsequently served in the Russian army from 1812 to 1813 during the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Russian Campaign]] including at the [[Battle of Borodino]]. Like many Prussian officers living in Russia, he joined the [[Russian-German Legion]] in 1813. In the service of the [[Russian Empire]], Clausewitz helped negotiate the [[Convention of Tauroggen]] (1812), which prepared the way for the coalition of Prussia, Russia, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] that ultimately defeated [[Napoleon I]] and his allies. 

In 1815, the Russo-German Legion was integrated into the Prussian Army and Clausewitz re-entered Prussian service. He was soon appointed chief of staff to [[Johann von Thielmann]]'s III Corps. In that capacity, he served at the [[Battle of Ligny]] and the [[Battle of Wavre]] during the [[Waterloo Campaign]] in 1815.  The Prussians were defeated  at [[Ligny]] &amp;ndash; south of [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] and the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] &amp;ndash; by an army led personally by Napoleon, but Napoleon's failure to actually destroy the Prussian forces led to his eventual defeat a few days later at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], when the Prussian forces arrived on his right flank late in the afternoon and joined the Anglo-Dutch forces pressing Napoleon's front. 

Clausewitz was promoted to Major-General in 1818 and appointed director of the ''Kriegsakademie'', where he served until 1830. In the latter year, the outbreak of several revolutions around Europe and a crisis in [[Poland]] appeared to presage another major European war. Clausewitz was appointed chief-of-staff to the only army Prussia was able to mobilize, which was sent to the Polish border. He subsequently died after commanding the Prussian army's efforts to construct a 'cordon sanitaire' to contain the great [[Cholera]] outbreak in 1831 (the first time Cholera had appeared in Europe, causing a continent-wide panic).  His widow was left to publish his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' on the [[philosophy of war]] posthumously, in 1832 &amp;ndash; a book he had started working on in 1816 but had not completed.&lt;ref name=smith57&gt;Smith, Rupert, ''The Utility of Force'', Penguin Books, 2006, page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of war==
Clausewitz was a professional soldier who participated in numerous military campaigns, but he is famous primarily as a military theorist interested in the examination of war.  He wrote a careful, systematic, philosophical examination of war in all its aspects, as he saw it and taught it. The result was his principal work, ''[[On War]],'' the West's premier work on the philosophy of war.  It was only partially completed by the time of his death, but just how close to completion it was is a matter of considerable scholarly debate. Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text, particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignment, to include more material on &quot;people's war&quot; and forms of war other than between states, but little of this material was included in the published book.&lt;ref name=smith57 /&gt; Other soldiers before this time had written treatises on various military subjects, but none had undertaken a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of Clausewitz's and [[Tolstoy]]'s, both of which were inspired by the events of the [[Napoleonic Era]].

Clausewitz's work is still studied today, demonstrating its continued relevance. More than ten major English-language books focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2010. [[Lynn Montross]] writing on that topic in ''War Through the Ages'' (1960) said; &quot;This outcome...may be explained by the fact that [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]] produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy.  The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons.&quot;

Clausewitz introduced systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking, with powerful implications not only for historical and analytical writing but for practical policy, military instruction, and operational planning. He relied on his own experiences, contemporary writings about Napoleon, and on historical sources. His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study, written when he was twenty-five, of the [[Thirty Years War]]. He rejects the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s view of the war as a chaotic muddle and instead explains its drawn-out operations by the [[economy]] and [[technology]] of the age, the social characteristics of the troops, and the commanders' politics and psychology. In ''On War'', Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions, actions, and reactions in an uncertain, dangerous context but also as a socio-political phenomenon. He has several definitions, the most famous one being that war is the continuation of politics by other means. He also stressed the complex nature of war which encompasses both the socio-political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy. 

The word &quot;[[strategy]]&quot; had only recently come into usage in Modern Europe, and Clausewitz's definition is quite narrow: &quot;the use of engagements for the object of war.&quot; Some modern readers find this narrow definition disappointing, but his focus was on the conduct of military operations in war, not on the full range of the conduct of politics in war. Nonetheless, Clausewitz conceived of war as a political, social, and military phenomenon which might--depending on circumstances--involve the entire population of a nation at war.   In any case, Clausewitz saw military force as an instrument that states and other political actors use to pursue the ends of policy, in a dialectic between two opposing wills, each with the aim of imposing his policies and will upon his enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Beatrice Heuser, &quot;Clausewitz’ Ideas of Strategy and Victory&quot;, in Andreas Herberg-Rothe and Hew Strachan (eds): ''Clausewitz in the 21st Century'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 132-163.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Clausewitz's emphasis on the inherent superiority of the defense suggests that habitual aggressors are likely to wind up failures. However, the inherent superiority of the defense does not mean (obviously) that the defender will always win. There are other asymmetries to be considered. He was interested in cooperation between the regular army and militia or partisan forces, or citizen soldiers, as one possible--sometimes the only possible--method of defense. In the circumstances of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon, which were energized by a rising spirit of nationalism, he emphasized the need for states to involve their entire populations in the conduct of war. This point is especially important, as these wars demonstrated that such energies could be of decisive importance and for a time led to a democratization of the armed forces much as universal suffrage democraticized politics.

While Clausewitz was intensely aware of the value of intelligence at all levels, he was also very skeptical of the accuracy of much military intelligence: &quot;Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain. ... In short, most intelligence is false.&quot; Such skeptical comments, however, apply exclusively to intelligence at the tactical and operational levels; at the strategic and political levels he constantly stressed the requirement for the best possible understanding of what today would be called strategic and political intelligence. His conclusions were influenced by his personal experiences in the Prussian Army, which was often in an intelligence fog due partly to the superior abilities of Napoleon's system but even more to the nature of war.  Clausewitz acknowledges that friction creates enormous difficulties for the realization of any plan, and the &quot;fog of war&quot; hinders commanders from knowing what is happening. It is precisely in the context of this challenge that he develops the concept of military genius, whose capabilities are seen above all in the execution of operations.

===Principal ideas===
[[Image:CarlvonClausewitz.jpg|thumb|164px&lt;!--maximum size available--&gt;|A young Carl von Clausewitz]]

Some of the key ideas discussed in ''On War'' include:
* the dialectical approach to military analysis
* the methods of &quot;critical analysis&quot;
* the nature of the balance-of-power mechanism
* the relationship between political objectives and military objectives in war
* the asymmetrical relationship between attack and defense
* the nature of &quot;military genius&quot; (involving matters of personality and character, beyond intellect)
* the &quot;fascinating trinity&quot; (''wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit'') of war
* philosophical distinctions between &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;ideal war,&quot; and &quot;real war&quot;
* in &quot;real war,&quot; the distinctive poles of a) limited war and b) war to &quot;render the enemy helpless&quot;
* &quot;war&quot; belongs fundamentally to the social realm—rather than to the realms of art or science
* &quot;strategy&quot; belongs primarily to the realm of art
* &quot;tactics&quot; belongs primarily to the realm of science
* the importance of &quot;moral forces&quot; (more than simply &quot;morale&quot;) as opposed to quantifiable physical elements
* the &quot;military virtues&quot; of professional armies (which do not necessarily trump the rather different virtues of other kinds of fighting forces)
* conversely, the very real effects of a superiority in numbers and &quot;mass&quot;
* the essential unpredictability of war
* the [[fog of war|&quot;fog&quot; of war]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Fog of war&quot;/&gt;
* &quot;friction&quot; - the disparity between the ideal performance of units, organisation or systems and their actual performance in real world scenarios (Book I, Chapter VII)
* strategic and operational &quot;centers of gravity&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gravity&quot;/&gt;
* the &quot;culminating point of the offensive&quot;
* the &quot;culminating point of victory&quot;

==Interpretation and misinterpretation==
Clausewitz used a [[dialectical]] method to construct his argument, leading to frequent misinterpretation of his ideas. British military theorist [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] contends that the enthusiastic acceptance of the [[Prussian]] military establishment &amp;ndash; especially [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke the Elder]] &amp;ndash; of what they believed to be Clausewitz's ideas, and the subsequent widespread adoption of the Prussian military system worldwide, had a deleterious effect on [[military theory]] and [[warfare|practice]], due to their egregious misinterpretation of his ideas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As so often happens, Clausewitz's disciples carried his teaching to an extreme which their master had not intended. ... [Clauswitz's]  theory of war was expounded in a way too abstract and involved for ordinary soldier-minds, essentially concrete, to follow the course of his argument &amp;ndash; which often turned back from the direction in which it was apparently leading.  Impressed yet befogged, they grasped at his vivid leading phrases, seeing only their surface meaning, and missing the deeper current of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]] ''Strategy'' London:Faber, 1967. Second rev. ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As described by [[Christopher Bassford]], professor of strategy at the [[National War College]] of the United States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main sources of confusion about Clausewitz's approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation. For example, Clausewitz's famous line that &quot;War is a mere continuation of politics by other means,&quot; (&quot;Der Krieg ist eine bloße Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln&quot;) while accurate as far as it goes, was not intended as a statement of fact. It is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point &amp;ndash; made earlier in the analysis &amp;ndash; that &quot;war is nothing but a duel [or wrestling match, a better translation of the German ''Zweikampf''] on a larger scale.&quot; His synthesis, which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements, says that war is neither &quot;nothing but&quot; an act of brute force nor &quot;merely&quot; a rational act of politics or policy. This synthesis lies in his &quot;fascinating trinity&quot; [wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit]: a dynamic, inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion, chance, and rational calculation.&lt;ref name=bassford /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example of this confusion is the idea that Clausewitz was a proponent of [[total war]] as used in the Third Reich's propaganda in the 1940s. He did not coin the phrase as an ideological ideal &amp;ndash; indeed, Clausewitz did not use the term &quot;total war&quot; at all. Rather, he discussed &quot;absolute war&quot; or &quot;ideal war&quot; as the purely ''logical'' result of the forces underlying a &quot;pure,&quot; Platonic &quot;ideal&quot; of war. In what Clausewitz called a &quot;logical fantasy,&quot; war cannot be waged in a limited way: the rules of competition will force participants to use all means at their disposal to achieve victory. But in the ''real world'', such rigid logic is unrealistic and dangerous. As a practical matter, the military objectives in ''real'' war that support one's political objectives generally fall into two broad types: &quot;war to achieve limited aims&quot; and war to &quot;disarm&quot; the enemy, that is, &quot;to render [him] politically helpless or militarily impotent.&quot; Thus the complete defeat of one's enemies may be neither necessary, desirable, nor even possible.

In modern times the reconstruction of Clausewitzian theory has been a matter of some dispute. One analysis was that of [[Panagiotis Kondylis]], a Greek-German writer and philosopher who opposed the interpretations of [[Raymond Aron]], in ''Penser la Guerre, Clausewitz'', and other liberal writers. According to Aron, Clausewitz was one of the very first writers to condemn the militarism of the Prussian general staff and its war-proneness, based on Clausewitz's argument that &quot;war is a continuation of politics by other means.&quot;  In ''Theory of War,'' Kondylis claims that this is inconsistent with Clausewitzian thought. He claims that Clausewitz was morally indifferent to war (though this probably reflects a lack of familiarity with Clausewitz personal letters, etc., which demonstrate an acute awareness of war's tragic aspects) and that his advice regarding politics' dominance over the conduct of war has nothing to do with pacifistic ideas. For Clausewitz, war is simply a means to the eternal quest for power, of ''raison d'État'' in an anarchic and unsafe world. 

Other notable writers who have studied Clausewitz's texts and translated them into English are historians [[Peter Paret]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]], and the philosopher, musician, and [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Anatol Rapoport]]. Howard and Paret edited the most widely used edition of ''On War'' (Princeton University Press, 1976/1984) and have produced comparative studies of Clausewitz and other theorists, such as Tolstoy. [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]]'s ''A Guide to the Reading of &quot;On War&quot;'', in the 1976 Princeton translation, expressed his own interpretations of the Prussian's theories and provided students with an influential synopsis of this vital work.

==Influence==
Despite his death without having completed ''On War'', Clausewitz' ideas have been widely influential in [[military theory]] and have had a strong influence on German military thought. Later Prussian and German generals such as [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth Graf von Moltke]] were clearly influenced by Clausewitz: Moltke's notable statement that &quot;No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy&quot; is a classic reflection of Clausewitz's insistence on the roles of chance, friction, &quot;fog&quot;, uncertainty, and interactivity in war. 

After 1890 or so, Clausewitz's influence spread to British thinking as well. One example is naval historian [[Julian Corbett]] (1854–1922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz's concepts.  Clausewitz had little influence on American military thought before 1945, but influenced [[Marx]], [[Engels]], [[Lenin]], and [[Mao]], and thus the Communist and Soviet traditions, as Lenin emphasized the inevitability of wars among capitalist states in the age of imperialism and presented the armed struggle of the working class as the only path toward the eventual elimination of war.&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, Joseph W. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026-3931(198510)49%3A4%3C184%3ALACTMO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 &quot;Lenin and Clausewitz: the Militarization of Marxism, 1914-1921.&quot;] ''Military Affairs'' 1985 49(4): 184-191. Issn: 0026-3931. In Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Vladimir Lenin]] was an admirer of Clausewitz who called him &quot;one of the great military writers&quot;, his influence on the Red Army was immense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mertsalov, A.N. pages 11-19&quot;&gt;Mertsalov, A.N. “Jomini versus Clausewitz” pages 11-19 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian historian A.N. Mertsalov commented that &quot;It was an irony of fate that the view in the USSR was that it was Lenin who shaped the attitude towards Clausewitz, and that Lenin's dictum that war is a continuation of politics is taken from the work of this anti-humanist anti-revolutionary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mertsalov, A.N. pages 11-19&quot;/&gt; Clausewitz directly influenced Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]], who read ''On War'' in 1938 and organized a seminar on Clausewitz as part of the educational program for the Party leadership in [[Yan'an]]. Thus the &quot;Clausewitzian&quot; content in many of Mao's writings is not merely second-hand knowledge, via Lenin (as many have supposed), but reflects Mao's own in-depth study.

The idea that war involves inherent &quot;friction&quot; which distorts, to a greater or lesser degree, all prior arrangements, has become common currency in other fields as well, such as business strategy and sports.  The phrase ''[[fog of war]]'' derives from Clausewitz's stress on how confused warfare can seem while one is immersed within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berkun | first = Scott | title = The Art of Project Management | isbn = 0-596-00786-8 | year = 2005 | publisher = OŔeilly | location = Beijing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Center of gravity (military)|center of gravity]], used in a specifically military context, derives from Clausewitz's usage, which he took from [[Newtonian Mechanics]]. In US military doctrine, &quot;center of gravity&quot; refers to the basis of an opponent's power, at either the operational, strategic, or political level, though this is only one aspect of Clausewitz's own use of the term.

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
After 1970, some theorists claimed that [[nuclear proliferation]] made Clausewitzian concepts obsolete after a period &amp;ndash; the 20th century &amp;ndash; in which they dominated the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sheppard, John E., Jr. | title = On War: Is Clausewitz Still Relevant? | journal = Parameters | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | date = September 1990 | pages = 85–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Sheppard, Jr., argues that by developing nuclear weapons, state-based conventional armies simultaneously both perfected their original purpose &amp;ndash; to destroy a mirror image of themselves &amp;ndash; and made themselves obsolete.  No two [[nuclear powers]] have ever used their nuclear weapons against each other, instead using conventional means or [[proxy wars]] to settle disputes.  If, hypothetically, such a conflict did in fact occur, presumably both combatants would be [[Mutually assured destruction|effectively annihilated]].  

The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century has seen many instances of state armies attempting to suppress  [[insurgency|insurgencies]], [[terrorism]], and other forms of [[asymmetrical warfare]].  If Clausewitz focused solely on wars between countries with well-defined armies, as many commentators have argued, then perhaps ''On War'' has lost its analytical edge as a tool for understanding war as it is currently fought. This is an ahistorical view, however, for the era of the French Revolution and Napoleon was full of revolutions, rebellions, and violence by &quot;non-state actors&quot;--the war in the French Vendée, the war in Spain, etc. Furthermore, Clausewitz himself wrote a series of “Lectures on Small War” and studied the rebellion in the Vendée 1793-1796 and the Tyrolean uprising of 1809. In his famous “Bekenntnisdenkschrift” of 1812, he called for a “Spanish war in Germany” and laid out  a comprehensive guerrilla strategy to be waged against Napoleon. In ''On War'' itself he included a famous chapter on “The People in Arms.”

One prominent critic of Clausewitz is the Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld. In his book ''The Transformation of War'',&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Creveld, ''The Transformation of War: The Most Radical Reinterpretation of Armed Conflict Since Clausewitz'' (New York: The Free Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Creveld argued that Clausewitz's famous &quot;Trinity&quot; of people, army, and government was an obsolete socio-political construct based on the state, which was rapidly passing from the scene as the key player in war, and that he (Creveld) had constructed a new &quot;non-trinitarian&quot; model for modern warfare. Creveld's work has had great influence. Daniel Moran replied, however, saying 'The most egregious misrepresentation of Clausewitz’s famous metaphor must be that of Martin van Creveld, who has declared Clausewitz to be an apostle of Trinitarian War, by which he means, incomprehensibly, a war of 'state against state and army against army,' from which the influence of the people is entirely excluded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moran, &quot;Clausewitz on Waterloo: Napoleon at Bay,&quot; in Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, ''On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellington, and the Campaign of 1815'', ed./trans. Christopher Bassford, Daniel Moran, and Gregory W. Pedlow (Clausewitz.com, 2010), p.242, n.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Bassford went further, noting that one need only ''read'' the paragraph in which Clausewitz defined his Trinity to see &quot;that the words 'people,' 'army,' and 'government' appear nowhere at all in the list of the Trinity’s components.... Creveld's and Keegan's assault on Clausewitz's Trinity is not only a classic 'blow into the air,' i.e., an assault on a position Clausewitz doesn't occupy. It is also a pointless attack on a concept that is quite useful in its own right. In any case, their failure to read the actual wording of the theory they so vociferously attack, and to grasp its deep relevance to the phenomena they describe, is hard to credit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bassford, &quot;Tip-Toe Through the Trinity,&quot; http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/Bassford/Trinity/Trinity8.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some have gone further and suggested that Clausewitz's best known aphorism, that war is a continuation of policy by other means, is not only irrelevant today but also inapplicable historically.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance John Keegan, ''A History of Warfare'' (New York: Knopf, 1993), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; For an opposing view see [[Hew Strachan|Strachan, Hew]], and Herberg-Rothe, Andreas, eds. ''Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;See the 16 essays in Hew Strachan and Andreas Herberg-Rothe, eds., ''Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), which is the proceedings of a 2005 conference at Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, however, argue that the essentials of Clausewitz's theoretical approach remain valid, but that our thinking must adjust to the realities of particular times and places. Knowing that &quot;war is an expression of politics by other means&quot; does us no good unless we use a definition of &quot;politics&quot; which is appropriate to the circumstance and to the cultural proclivities of the combatants in each specific situation; this is especially true when warfare is carried on across a cultural or civilizational divide, and the antagonists do not share as much common background as did many of the participants in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s.

==In popular culture==
;Literature
*1945: In the [[Horatio Hornblower]] novel ''[[The Commodore]]'', by [[C. S. Forester]], the protagonist meets von Clausewitz during the events surrounding the defence of [[Riga]].
*1945: In ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], Lord Feverstone (Dick Devine) defends rudely cutting off another professor by saying &quot;[...] but then I take the Clausewitz view. Total war is the most humane in the long run.&quot;
*1955: In [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'', [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] reflects that he has achieved Clausewitz's first principle in securing his base, though this base is a relationship for intelligence purposes and not a military installation.
*1977: In ''[[The Wars]]'' by [[Timothy Findley]], a novel about a nineteen-year-old Canadian officer who serves in World War I, one of his fellow soldiers reads Clausewitz's ''[[On War]]'', and occasionally quotes some of its passages.
*2000: In the Ethan Stark [[military science fiction]] book series by [[John G. Hemry]], Clausewitz is often quoted by Private Mendoza and his father Lieutenant Mendoza to explain events that unfold during the series.
*2004: [[Bob Dylan]] mentions Clausewitz on pages 41 and 45 of his ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', saying he had &quot;a morbid fascination with this stuff,&quot; that &quot;Clausewitz in some ways is a prophet&quot; and reading Clausewitz can make you &quot;take your own thoughts a little less seriously.&quot; Dylan says that ''Vom Kriege'' was one of the books he looked through among those he found in his friend's personal library as a young man playing at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in [[Greenwich Village]].

;Film
*1962: In the film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', General [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]] ([[Jack Hawkins]]) contends to [[T. E. Lawrence]] ([[Peter O'Toole]]) that &quot;I fight like Clausewitz, you fight like [[Maurice de Saxe|Saxe]].&quot; To which Lawrence replies, &quot;We should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?&quot;
*1977: In [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Cross of Iron]]'', Feldwebel Steiner ([[James Coburn]]) has an ironic conversation in the trenches between hostilities with the advancing Red Army with his comrade, Cpl. Schnurrbart, in which they refer to German philosophers and their views on war. Cpl. Schnurrbart: &quot; ...and von Clausewitz said, 'war is a continuation of state policy by other means.'&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Steiner says, overlooking the trenches, &quot; ...by other means.&quot;
*1995: In the film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', the naval officers of the nuclear submarine have a discussion about the meaning of the quote &quot;War is a continuation of politics by other means.&quot; The executive officer ([[Denzel Washington]]) contends that the interpretation of Clausewitz's ideas by the captain ([[Gene Hackman]]) is too simplistic.
*2007: In the film ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', during a military briefing in [[Afghanistan]] Lt. Col. Falco ([[Peter Berg]]) says: &quot;Remember your von Clausewitz: 'Never engage the same enemy for too long or he will ...'&quot;, &quot;adapt to your tactics&quot;, completes another soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Lions for Lambs'' script (retrieved 14/06/09) | url=http://www.130q.com/show.php?tid=2110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2009: In the film ''[[Law Abiding Citizen]]'', Clausewitz is frequently quoted by Clyde Shelton, the main character played by Gerard Butler.

'''Common Lisp''', commonly abbreviated '''CL''', is a dialect of the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] [[programming language]], published in [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard document ''ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (R2004)'', (formerly ''X3.226-1994 (R1999))''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI+INCITS+226-1994+(R2004) Document page] at ANSI website&lt;/ref&gt; From the ANSI Common Lisp standard the [[Common Lisp HyperSpec]] has been derived&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/Help.htm#Authorship Authorship of the Common Lisp HyperSpec]&lt;/ref&gt; for use with web browsers. Common Lisp was developed to standardize the divergent variants of Lisp (though mainly the MacLisp variants) which predated it, thus it is not an implementation but rather a language [[specification]]. Several [[#Implementations|implementations]] of the Common Lisp standard are available, including [[free and open source software]] and proprietary products.

Common Lisp is a general-purpose, [[multi-paradigm programming language]]. It supports a combination of [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[functional programming|functional]], and [[object-oriented]] programming paradigms. As a [[dynamic programming language]], it facilitates evolutionary and [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental software development]], with iterative [[Compiler|compilation]] into efficient run-time programs.

It also supports optional type annotation and casting, which can be added as necessary at the later profiling and optimization stages, to permit the compiler to generate more efficient code. For instance, &lt;code&gt;fixnum&lt;/code&gt; can hold an [[Boxing (computer science)|unboxed]] integer in a range supported by the hardware and implementation, permitting more efficient arithmetic than on big integers or arbitrary precision types.

Common Lisp includes [[Common Lisp Object System|CLOS]], an [[object system]] that supports [[multimethods]] and method combinations. It is extensible through standard features such as Lisp [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] (compile-time code rearrangement accomplished by the program itself) and reader macros (extension of syntax to give special meaning to characters reserved for users for this purpose).

Though Common Lisp is not as popular as some non-Lisp languages, many of its features have made their way into other, more widely used programming languages and systems.  (See [[Greenspun's Tenth Rule]].)

==Syntax==

Common Lisp is a dialect of Lisp; it uses [[S-expression]]s to denote both code and data structure. Function and macro calls are written as lists, with the name of the function first, as in these examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (+ 2 2)           ; adds 2 and 2, yielding 4.
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defvar *x*)      ; Ensures that a variable *x* exists,
                   ; without giving it a value. The asterisks are part of
                   ; the name. The symbol *x* is also hereby endowed with
                   ; the property that subsequent bindings of it are dynamic,
                   ; rather than lexical.
 (setf *x* 42.1)   ; sets the variable *x* to the floating-point value 42.1
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 ;; Define a function that squares a number:
 (defun square (x)
   (* x x))
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 ;; Execute the function:
 (square 3)        ; Returns 9
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!--                  I truncated this a bit; in smaller browsers, it runs off the side--&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 ;; the 'let' construct creates a scope for local variables. Here
 ;; the variable 'a' is bound to 6 and the variable 'b' is bound
 ;; to 4. Inside the 'let' is a 'body', where the last computed value is returned.
 ;; Here the result of adding a and b is returned from the 'let' expression.
 ;; The variables a and b have lexical scope, unless the symbols have been
 ;; marked as special variables (for instance by a prior DEFVAR).
 (let ((a 6)
       (b 4))
   (+ a b))        ; returns 10
&lt;/source&gt;

==Data types==
Common Lisp has many data types&amp;mdash;more than many other languages.

===Scalar types===
''Number'' types include [[integer]]s, [[ratio]]s, [[Floating point|floating-point number]]s, and [[complex number]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;reddy&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://abhishek.geek.nz/docs/features-of-common-lisp
 | title = Features of Common Lisp
 | first = Abhishek | last = Reddy
 | date = 2008-08-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Lisp uses [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|bignum]]s to represent numerical values of arbitrary size and precision. The ratio type represents fractions exactly, a facility not available in many languages. Common Lisp automatically coerces numeric values among these types as appropriate.

The Common Lisp ''[[character (computing)|character]]'' type is not limited to [[ASCII]] characters. Most modern implementations allow [[Unicode]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.cliki.net/Unicode%20Support
 | title = Unicode support | work = The Common Lisp Wiki | accessdate = 2008-08-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[symbol]]'' type is common to Lisp languages, but largely unknown outside them. A symbol is a unique, named data object with several parts: name, value, function, property list and package. Of these, ''value cell'' and ''function cell'' are the most important. Symbols in Lisp are often used similarly to identifiers in other languages: to hold value of a variable; however there are many other uses. Normally, when a symbol is evaluated, its value is returned. Some symbols evaluate to themselves, for example all symbols in the keyword package are self-evaluating. Boolean values in Common Lisp are represented by the self-evaluating symbols T and NIL. Common Lisp has namespaces for symbols, called 'packages'.

A number of functions are available for [[rounding]] scalar numeric values in various ways. The function &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt; rounds the argument to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded to even  The functions &lt;code&gt;truncate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ceiling&lt;/code&gt; round towards zero, down, or up respectively.  All these functions return the discarded fractional part as a secondary value. For example, &lt;code&gt;(floor -2.5)&lt;/code&gt; yields -3, 0.5; &lt;code&gt;(ceiling -2.5)&lt;/code&gt;  yields -2, -0.5; &lt;code&gt;(round 2.5)&lt;/code&gt; yields 2, 0.5; and &lt;code&gt;(round 3.5)&lt;/code&gt; yields 4, -0.5.

===Data structures===
''Sequence'' types in Common Lisp include lists, vectors, bit-vectors, and strings. There are many operations which can work on any sequence type.

As in almost all other Lisp dialects, ''lists'' in Common Lisp are composed of ''conses'', sometimes called ''cons cells'' or ''pairs''. A cons is a data structure with two slots, called its ''car'' and ''cdr''. A list is a linked chain of conses. Each cons's car refers to a member of the list (possibly another list). Each cons's cdr refers to the next cons—except for the last cons, whose cdr refers to the &lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt; value. Conses can also easily be used to implement trees and other complex data structures; though it is usually advised to use structure
or class instances instead. It is also possible to create circular data structures with conses.

Common Lisp supports multidimensional ''arrays'', and can dynamically resize arrays if required. Multidimensional arrays can be used for matrix mathematics. A ''vector'' is a one-dimensional array. Arrays can carry any type as members (even mixed types in the same array) or can be specialized to contain a specific type of members, as in a vector of integers. Many implementations can optimize array functions when the array used is type-specialized. Two type-specialized array types are standard: a ''string'' is a vector of characters, while a ''bit-vector'' is a vector of [[bit]]s.

''[[Hash table]]s'' store associations between data objects. Any object may be used as key or value. Hash tables, like arrays, are automatically resized as needed.

''Packages'' are collections of symbols, used chiefly to separate the parts of a program into [[Namespace (computer science)|namespaces]]. A package may ''export'' some symbols, marking them as part of a public interface. Packages can use other packages.

''Structures'', similar in use to [[C (programming language)|C]] structs and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] records, represent arbitrary complex data structures with any number and type of fields (called ''slots''). Structures allow single-inheritance.

''Classes'' are similar to structures, but offer more dynamic features and multiple-inheritance. (See [[Common Lisp Object System|CLOS]].) Classes have been added late to Common Lisp and there is some conceptual overlap with structures. Objects created of classes are called ''Instances''. A special case are Generic Functions. Generic Functions are both functions and instances.

===Functions===
Common Lisp supports [[first-class function]]s.  For instance, it is possible to write functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as well.  This makes it possible to describe very general operations.

The Common Lisp library relies heavily on such higher-order functions. For example, the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; function takes a [[relational operator]] as an argument and key function as an optional keyword argument. This can be used not only to sort any type of data, but also to sort data structures according to a key.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (sort (list 5 2 6 3 1 4) #'&gt;)
 ; Sorts the list using the &gt; function as the relational operator.
 ; Returns (6 5 4 3 2 1).
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (sort (list '(9 A) '(3 B) '(4 C)) #'&lt; :key #'first)
 ; Sorts the list according to the first element of each sub-list.
 ; Returns ((3 B) (4 C) (9 A)).
&lt;/source&gt;

The evaluation model for functions is very simple.  When the evaluator encounters a form &lt;code&gt;(F A1 A2...)&lt;/code&gt; then it is to assume that the symbol named F is one of the following:

# A special operator (easily checked against a fixed list)
# A macro operator (must have been defined previously)
# The name of a function (default), which may either be a symbol, or a sub-form beginning with the symbol &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;.

If F is the name of a function, then the arguments A1, A2, ..., An are evaluated in left-to-right order, and the function is found and invoked with those values supplied as parameters.

====Defining functions====
The macro &lt;code&gt;[[defun]]&lt;/code&gt; defines functions.
A function definition gives the name of the function, the names of any arguments, and a function body:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun square (x)
   (* x x))
&lt;/source&gt;

Function definitions may include ''declarations'', which provide hints to the compiler about optimization settings or the data types of arguments. They may also include ''documentation strings'' (docstrings), which the Lisp system may use to provide interactive documentation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun square (x)
   &quot;Calculates the square of the single-float x.&quot;
   (declare (single-float x) (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 1)))
   (the single-float (* x x)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Anonymous functions ([[function literal]]s) are defined using &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expressions, e.g. &lt;code&gt;(lambda&amp;nbsp;(x)&amp;nbsp;(*&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;x))&lt;/code&gt; for a function that squares its argument. Lisp programming style frequently uses higher-order functions for which it is useful to provide anonymous functions as arguments.

Local functions can be defined with &lt;code&gt;flet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (flet ((square (x)
          (* x x)))
   (square 3))
&lt;/source&gt;

There are a number of other operators related to the definition and manipulation of functions. For instance, a function may be recompiled with the &lt;code&gt;compile&lt;/code&gt; operator. (Some Lisp systems run functions in an interpreter by default unless instructed to compile; others compile every entered function on the fly.)

====Defining generic functions and methods====
The macro &lt;code&gt;defgeneric&lt;/code&gt; defines generic functions.
The macro &lt;code&gt;defmethod&lt;/code&gt; defines methods. Generic functions are a collection of methods.

Methods can specialize their parameters over classes or objects.

When a generic function is called, multiple-dispatch will determine the correct method to use.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defgeneric add (a b))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defmethod add ((a number) (b number))
    (+ a b))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defmethod add ((a vector) (b number))
    (map 'vector (lambda (n) (+ n b)) a))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defmethod add ((a vector) (b vector))
    (map 'vector #'+ a b))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (add 2 3)                   ; returns 5
 (add #(1 2 3 4) 7)          ; returns #(8 9 10 11)
 (add #(1 2 3 4) #(4 3 2 1)) ; returns #(5 5 5 5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Generic Functions are also a first class data type. There are many more features to Generic Functions and Methods than described above.

====The function namespace====
&lt;!-- This section name is linked from several places; if you change it, update the links. --&gt;

The namespace for function names is separate from the namespace for data variables. This is a key difference between Common Lisp and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. For Common Lisp, operators that define names in the function namespace include &lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;defmethod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;defgeneric&lt;/code&gt;.

To pass a function by name as an argument to another function, one must use the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; special operator, commonly abbreviated as &lt;code&gt;#'&lt;/code&gt;. The first &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; example above refers to the function named by the symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the function namespace, with the code &lt;code&gt;#'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme's]] evaluation model is simpler: there is only one namespace, and all positions in the form are evaluated (in any order) -- not just the arguments. Code written in one dialect is therefore sometimes confusing to programmers more experienced in the other. For instance, many Common Lisp programmers like to use descriptive variable names such as ''list'' or ''string'' which could cause problems in Scheme as they would locally shadow function names.

Whether a separate namespace for functions is an advantage is a source of contention in the Lisp community. It is usually referred to as the ''Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 debate''. Lisp-1 refers to Scheme's model and Lisp-2 refers to Common Lisp's model. These names were coined in a 1988 paper by [[Richard P. Gabriel]] and [[Kent Pitman]], which extensively compares the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Technical Issues of Separation in Function Cells and Value Cells |url=http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html |authors=Richard P. Gabriel, Kent M. Pitman |journal=Lisp and Symbolic Computation |date = June 1988|volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=81–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other types===
Other data types in Common Lisp include:

*''Pathnames'' represent files and directories in the [[filesystem]]. The Common Lisp pathname facility is more general than most operating systems' file naming conventions, making Lisp programs' access to files broadly portable across diverse systems.
*Input and output ''streams'' represent sources and sinks of binary or textual data, such as the terminal or open files.
*Common Lisp has a built-in [[pseudo-random number generator]] (PRNG). ''Random state'' objects represent reusable sources of pseudo-random numbers, allowing the user to seed the PRNG or cause it to replay a sequence.
*''Conditions'' are a type used to represent errors, exceptions, and other &quot;interesting&quot; events to which a program may respond.
*''Classes'' are [[first-class object]]s, and are themselves instances of classes called [[metaclasses|class metaobject classes]].
*''Readtables'' are a type of object which control how Common Lisp's reader parses the text of source code.  By controlling which readtable is in use when code is read in, the programmer can change or extend the language's syntax.

==Scope==

Like programs in many other programming languages, Common Lisp programs make use of names to refer to variables, functions, and many other kinds of entities. Named references are subject to scope.

The association between a name and the entity which the name refers to is called a binding.

Scope refers to the set of circumstances in which a name is determined to have a particular binding.

===Determiners of scope===

The circumstances which determine scope in Common Lisp include:

* the location of a reference within an expression. If it's the leftmost position of a compound, it refers to a special operator or a macro or function binding, otherwise to a variable binding or something else.
* the kind of expression in which the reference takes place. For instance, (GO X) means transfer control to label X, whereas (PRINT X) refers to the variable X. Both scopes of X can be active in the same region of program text, since tagbody labels are in a separate namespace from variable names. A special form or macro form has complete control over the meanings of all symbols in its syntax. For instance in (defclass x (a b) ()), a class definition, the (a b) is a list of base classes, so these names are looked up in the space of class names, and x isn't a reference to an existing binding, but the name of a new class being derived from a and b. These facts emerge purely from the semantics of defclass. The only generic fact about this expression is that defclass refers to a macro binding; everything else is up to defclass.
* the location of the reference within the program text. For instance, if a reference to variable X is enclosed in a binding construct such as a LET which defines a binding for X, then the reference is in the scope created by that binding.
* for a variable reference, whether or not a variable symbol has been, locally or globally, declared special. This determines whether the reference is resolved within a lexical environment, or within a dynamic environment.
* the specific instance of the environment in which the reference is resolved. An environment is a run-time dictionary which maps symbols to bindings. Each kind of reference uses its own kind of environment. References to lexical variables are resolved in a lexical environment, et cetera. More than one environment can be associated with the same reference. For instance, thanks to recursion or the use of multiple threads, multiple activations of the same function can exist at the same time. These activations share the same program text, but each has its own lexical environment instance.

To understand what a symbol refers to, the Common Lisp programmer must know what kind of reference is being expressed, what kind of scope it uses if it is a variable reference (dynamic versus lexical scope), and also the run-time situation: in what environment is the reference resolved, where was the binding introduced into the environment, et cetera.

===Kinds of environment===
====Global====

Some environments in Lisp are globally pervasive. For instance, if a new type is defined, it is known everywhere thereafter. References to that type look it up in this global environment.

====Dynamic====

One type of environment in Common Lisp is the dynamic environment. Bindings established in this environment have dynamic extent, which means that a binding is established at the start of the execution of some construct, such as a &lt;code&gt;LET&lt;/code&gt; block, and disappears when that construct finishes executing: its lifetime is tied to the dynamic activation and deactivation of a block. However, a dynamic  binding is not just visible within that block; it is also visible to all functions invoked from that block.  This type of visibility is known as indefinite scope. Bindings which exhibit dynamic extent (lifetime tied to the activation and deactivation of a block) and indefinite scope  (visible to all functions which are called from that block) are said to have dynamic scope.

Common Lisp has support for dynamically scoped variables, which are also called special variables.  Certain other kinds of bindings are necessarily dynamically scoped also, such as restarts and catch tags.  Function bindings cannot be dynamically scoped using &lt;code&gt;FLET&lt;/code&gt; (which only provides lexically scoped function bindings), but function objects (a first-level object in Common Lisp) can be assigned to dynamically scoped variables, bound using &lt;code&gt;LET&lt;/code&gt; in dynamic scope, then called using &lt;code&gt;FUNCALL&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;APPLY&lt;/code&gt;.

Dynamic scope is extremely useful because it adds referential clarity and discipline to [[global variable]]s. Global variables are frowned upon in computer science as potential sources of error, because they can give rise to ad-hoc, covert channels of communication among modules that lead to unwanted, surprising interactions.

In Common Lisp, a special variable which has only a top-level binding behaves just like a global variable in other programming languages. A new value can be stored into it, and that value simply replaces what is in the top-level binding. Careless replacement of the value of a global variable is at the heart of bugs caused by use of global variables. However, another way to work with a special variable is to give it a new, local binding within an expression. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;rebinding&quot; the variable. Binding a dynamically scoped variable temporarily creates a new memory location for that variable, and associates the name with that location. While that binding is in effect, all references to that variable refer to the new binding; the previous binding is hidden. When execution of the binding expression terminates, the temporary memory location is gone, and the old binding is revealed, with the original value intact. Of course, multiple dynamic bindings for the same variable can be nested.

In Common Lisp implementations which support multithreading, dynamic scopes are specific to each thread of execution. Thus special variables serve as an abstraction for thread local storage. If one thread rebinds a special variable, this rebinding has no effect on that variable in other threads. The value stored in a binding can only be retrieved by the thread which created that binding. If each thread binds some special variable &lt;code&gt;*X*&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;*X*&lt;/code&gt; behaves like thread-local storage. Among threads which do not rebind &lt;code&gt;*X*&lt;/code&gt;, it behaves like an ordinary global: all of these threads refer to the same top-level binding of &lt;code&gt;*X*&lt;/code&gt;.

Dynamic variables can be used to extend the execution context with additional context information which is implicitly passed from function to function without having to appear as an extra function parameter. This is especially useful when the control transfer has to pass through layers of unrelated code, which simply cannot be extended with extra parameters to pass the additional data. A situation like this usually calls for a global variable. That global variable must be saved and restored, so that the scheme doesn't break under recursion: dynamic variable rebinding takes care of this. And that variable must be made thread-local (or else a big mutex must be used) so the scheme doesn't break under threads: dynamic scope implementations can take care of this also.

In the Common Lisp library, there are many standard special variables. For instance, the all standard I/O streams are stored in the top-level bindings of well-known special variables. The standard output stream is stored in *standard-output*.

Suppose a function foo writes to standard output:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (defun foo ()
    (format t &quot;Hello, world&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

To capture its output in a character string, *standard-output* can be bound to a string stream and called:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)
    (foo))
&lt;/source&gt;

  -&gt; &quot;Hello, world&quot; ; gathered output returned as a string

====Lexical====

Common Lisp supports lexical environments. Formally, the bindings in a lexical environment have [[lexical scope]] and may have either indefinite extent or dynamic extent, depending on the type of namespace. [[Lexical scope]] means that visibility is physically restricted to the block in which the binding is established. References which are not textually (i.e. lexically) embedded in that block simply do not see that binding.

The tags in a TAGBODY have lexical scope. The expression (GO X) is erroneous if it is not actually embedded in a TAGBODY which contains a label X. However, the label bindings disappear when the TAGBODY terminates its execution, because they have dynamic extent. If that block of code is re-entered by the invocation of a lexical closure, it is invalid for the body of that closure to try to transfer control to a tag via GO:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (defvar *stashed*) ;; will hold a function

  (tagbody
    (setf *stashed* (lambda () (go some-label)))
    (go end-label) ;; skip the (print &quot;Hello&quot;)
   some-label
    (print &quot;Hello&quot;)
   end-label)
  -&gt; NIL
&lt;/source&gt;

When the TAGBODY is executed, it first evaluates the setf form which stores a function in the special variable *stashed*. Then the (go end-label) transfers control to end-label, skipping the code (print &quot;Hello&quot;). Since end-label is at the end of the tagbody, the tagbody terminates, yielding NIL. Suppose that the previously remembered function is now called:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (funcall *stashed*) ;; Error!
&lt;/source&gt;

This situation is erroneous. One implementation's response is an error condition containing the message, &quot;GO: tagbody for tag SOME-LABEL has already been left&quot;. The function tried to evaluate (go some-label), which is lexically embedded in the tagbody, and resolves to the label. However, the tagbody isn't executing (its extent has ended), and so the control transfer cannot take place.

Local function bindings in Lisp have [[lexical scope]], and variable bindings also have lexical scope by default. By contrast with GO labels, both of these have indefinite extent. When a lexical function or variable binding is established, that binding continues to exist for as long as references to it are possible, even after the construct which established that binding has terminated. References to a lexical variables and functions after the termination of their establishing construct are possible thanks to [[lexical closure]]s.

Lexical binding is the default binding mode for Common Lisp variables. For an individual symbol, it can be switched to dynamic scope, either by a local declaration, by a global declaration. The latter may occur implicitly through the use of a construct like DEFVAR or DEFPARAMETER. It is an important convention in Common Lisp programming that special (i.e. dynamically scoped) variables have names which begin and end with an asterisk. If adhered to, this convention effectively creates a separate namespace for special variables, so that variables intended to be lexical are not accidentally made special.

[[Lexical scope]] is useful for several reasons.

Firstly, references to variables and functions can be compiled to efficient machine code, because the run-time environment structure is relatively simple. In many cases it can be optimized to stack storage, so opening and closing lexical scopes has minimal overhead. Even in cases where full closures must be generated, access to the closure's environment is still efficient; typically each variable becomes an offset into a vector of bindings, and so a variable reference becomes a simple load or store instruction with a base-plus-offset [[addressing mode]].

Secondly, lexical scope (combined with indefinite extent) gives rise to the [[lexical closure]], which in turn creates a whole paradigm of programming centered around the use of functions being first-class objects, which is at the root of functional programming.

Thirdly, perhaps most importantly, even if lexical closures are not exploited, the use of lexical scope isolates program modules from unwanted interactions. Due to their restricted visibility, lexical variables are private. If one module A binds a lexical variable X, and calls another module B, references to X in B will not accidentally resolve to the X bound in A. B simply has no access to X. For situations in which disciplined interactions through a variable are desirable, Common Lisp provides special variables. Special variables allow for a module A to set up a binding for a variable X which is visible to another module B, called from A. Being able to do this is an advantage, and being able to prevent it from happening is also an advantage; consequently, Common Lisp supports both lexical and [[dynamic scope]].

==Macros==
A ''[[Macro (computer science)|macro]]'' in Lisp superficially resembles a function in usage. However, rather than representing an expression which is evaluated, it represents a transformation of the program source code. The macro gets the source it surrounds as arguments, binds them to its parameters and computes a new source form. This new form can also use a macro. The macro expansion is repeated until the new source form does not use a macro. The final computed form is the source code executed at runtime.

Typical uses of macros in Lisp:

* new control structures (example: looping constructs, branching constructs)
* scoping and binding constructs
* simplified syntax for complex and repeated source code
* top-level defining forms with compile-time side-effects
* data-driven programming
* embedded domain specific languages (examples: SQL, HTML, Prolog)

Various standard Common Lisp features also need to be implemented as macros, such as:

* the standard &lt;code&gt;SETF&lt;/code&gt; abstraction, to allow custom compile-time expansions of assignment/access operators
* &lt;code&gt;WITH-ACCESSORS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WITH-SLOTS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WITH-OPEN-FILE&lt;/code&gt; and other similar &lt;code&gt;WITH&lt;/code&gt; macros
* Depending on implementation, &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;COND&lt;/code&gt; is a macro built on the other, the special operator; &lt;code&gt;WHEN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNLESS&lt;/code&gt; consist of macros
* The powerful &lt;code&gt;LOOP&lt;/code&gt; domain-specific language

Macros are defined by the ''defmacro'' macro. The special operator ''macrolet'' allows the definition of local (lexically scoped) macros. It is also possible to define macros for symbols using ''define-symbol-macro'' and ''symbol-macrolet''.

[[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]]'s book [[On Lisp]] describes the use of macros in Common Lisp in detail.

===Example using a Macro to define a new control structure===
Macros allow Lisp programmers to create new syntactic forms in the language. One typical use is to create new control structures. The example macro provides an &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; looping construct. The syntax is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
(until test form*)
&lt;/source&gt;

The macro definition for ''until'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defmacro until (test &amp;body body)
  (let ((start-tag (gensym &quot;START&quot;))
        (end-tag   (gensym &quot;END&quot;)))
    `(tagbody ,start-tag
              (when ,test (go ,end-tag))
              (progn ,@body)
              (go ,start-tag)
              ,end-tag)))
&lt;/source&gt;

''tagbody'' is a primitive Common Lisp special operator which provides the ability to name tags and use the ''go'' form to jump to those tags. The backquote ''`'' provides a notation that provides code templates, where the value of forms preceded with a comma are filled in. Forms preceded with comma and at-sign are ''spliced'' in. The tagbody form tests the end condition. If the condition is true, it jumps to the end tag. Otherwise the provided body code is executed and then it jumps to the start tag.

An example form using above ''until'' macro:
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(until (= (random 10) 0)
  (write-line &quot;Hello&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

The code can be expanded using the function ''macroexpand''. The expansion for above example looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(TAGBODY
 #:START1136
 (WHEN (ZEROP (RANDOM 10))
   (GO #:END1137))
 (PROGN (WRITE-LINE &quot;hello&quot;))
 (GO #:START1136)
 #:END1137)
&lt;/source&gt;

During macro expansion the value of the variable ''test'' is ''(= (random 10) 0)'' and the value of the variable ''body'' is ''((write-line &quot;Hello&quot;))''. The body is a list of forms.

Symbols are usually automatically upcased. The expansion uses the TAGBODY with two labels. The symbols for these labels are computed by GENSYM and are not interned in any package. Two ''go'' forms use these tags to jump to. Since ''tagbody'' is a primitive operator in Common Lisp (and not a macro), it will not be expanded into something else. The expanded form uses the ''when'' macro, which also will be expanded. Fully expanding a source form is called ''code walking''.

In the fully expanded (''walked'') form, the ''when'' form is replaced by the primitive ''if'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(TAGBODY
 #:START1136
 (IF (ZEROP (RANDOM 10))
     (PROGN (GO #:END1137))
   NIL)
 (PROGN (WRITE-LINE &quot;hello&quot;))
 (GO #:START1136))
 #:END1137)
&lt;/source&gt;

All macros must be expanded before the source code containing them can be evaluated or compiled normally.  Macros can be considered functions that accept and return [[abstract syntax tree]]s (Lisp S-expressions).  These functions
are invoked before the evaluator or compiler to produce the final source code.
Macros are written in normal Common Lisp, and may use any Common Lisp (or third-party) operator available.

===Variable capture and shadowing===
Common Lisp macros are capable of what is commonly called ''variable capture'', where symbols in the macro-expansion body coincide with those in the calling context, allowing the programmer to create macros wherein various symbols have special meaning. The term ''variable capture'' is somewhat misleading, because all namespaces are vulnerable to unwanted capture, including the operator and function namespace, the tagbody label namespace, catch tag, condition handler and restart namespaces.

''Variable capture'' can introduce software defects. This happens in one of the following two ways:

* In the first way, a macro expansion can inadvertently make a symbolic reference which the macro writer assumed will resolve in a global namespace, but the code where the macro is expanded happens to provide a local, shadowing definition it which steals that reference. Let this be referred to as type 1 capture.

* The second way, type 2 capture, is just the opposite: some of the arguments of the macro are pieces of code supplied by the macro caller, and those pieces of code are written such that they make references to surrounding bindings. However, the macro inserts these pieces of code into an expansion which defines its own bindings that accidentally captures some of these references.

The Scheme dialect of Lisp provides a macro-writing system which provides the referential transparency that eliminates both types of capture problem. This type of macro system is sometimes called &quot;hygienic&quot;, in particular by its proponents (who regard macro systems which do not automatically solve this problem as unhygienic). {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In Common Lisp, macro hygiene is ensured one of two different ways.

One approach is to use [[gensym]]s: guaranteed-unique symbols which can be used in a macro-expansion without threat of capture. The use of gensyms in a macro definition is a manual chore, but macros can be written which simplify the instantiation and use of gensyms.  Gensyms solve type 2 capture easily, but they are not applicable to type 1 capture in the same way, because the macro expansion cannot rename the interfering symbols in the surrounding code which capture its references. Gensyms could be used to provide stable aliases for the global symbols which the macro expansion needs. The macro expansion would use these secret aliases rather than the well-known names, so redefinition of the well-known names would have no ill effect on the macro.

Another approach is to use packages. A macro defined in its own package can simply use internal symbols in that package in its expansion. The use of packages deals with type 1 and type 2 capture.

However, packages don't solve the type 1 capture of references to standard Common Lisp functions and operators. The reason is that the use of packages to solve capture problems revolves around the use of private symbols (symbols in one package, which are not imported into, or otherwise made visible in other packages).  Whereas the Common Lisp library symbols are external, and frequently imported into or made visible in user-defined packages.

The following is an example of unwanted capture in the operator namespace, occurring in the expansion of a macro:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 ;; expansion of UNTIL makes liberal use of DO
 (defmacro until (expression &amp;body body)
   `(do () (,expression) ,@body))

 ;; macrolet establishes lexical operator binding for DO
 (macrolet ((do (...) ... something else ...))
   (until (= (random 10) 0) (write-line &quot;Hello&quot;)))
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; macro will expand into a form which calls &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; which is intended to refer to the standard Common Lisp macro &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt;. However, in this context, &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; may have a completely different meaning, so &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; may not work properly.

Common Lisp solves the problem of the shadowing of standard operators and functions by forbidding their redefinition. Because it redefines the standard operator &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt;, the preceding is actually a fragment of non-conforming Common Lisp, which allows implementations to diagnose and reject it.

==Condition System==
The ''Condition System'' is responsible for [[exception handling]] in Common Lisp. It provides ''conditions'', ''handler''s and ''restart''s. ''Condition''s are objects describing an exceptional situation (for example an error). If a ''condition'' is signaled, the Common Lisp system searches for a ''handler'' for this condition type and calls the handler. The ''handler'' can now search for restarts and use one of these restarts to repair the current problem. As part of a user interface (for example of a debugger), these restarts can also be presented to the user, so that the user can select and invoke one of the available restarts. Since the condition handler is called in the context of the error (without unwinding the stack), full error recovery is possible in many cases, where other exception handling systems would have already terminated the current routine.

In the following example (using [[Symbolics Genera]]) the user tries to open a file in a Lisp function ''test'' called from the Read-Eval-Print-LOOP ([[REPL]]), when the file does not exist. The Lisp system presents four restarts. The user selects the ''Retry OPEN using a different pathname'' restart and enters a different pathname (lispm-init.lisp instead of lispm-int.lisp). The user code does not contain any error handling code. The whole error handling and restart code is provided by the Lisp system, which can handle and repair the error without terminating the user code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Command: (test &quot;&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp&quot;)

Error: The file was not found.
       For lispm:&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp.newest

LMFS:OPEN-LOCAL-LMFS-1
   Arg 0: #P&quot;lispm:&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp.newest&quot;

s-A, &lt;Resume&gt;: Retry OPEN of lispm:&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp.newest
s-B:           Retry OPEN using a different pathname
s-C, &lt;Abort&gt;:  Return to Lisp Top Level in a TELNET server
s-D:           Restart process TELNET terminal

-&gt; Retry OPEN using a different pathname
Use what pathname instead [default lispm:&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp.newest]:
   lispm:&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-init.lisp.newest

...the program continues
&lt;/source&gt;

==Common Lisp Object System==

{{Main|Common Lisp Object System}}

Common Lisp includes a toolkit for [[object-oriented programming]], the Common Lisp Object System or [[Common Lisp Object System|CLOS]], which is one of the most powerful object systems available in any language. For example [[Peter Norvig]] explains how many [[Design pattern (computer science)|Design Patterns]] are simpler to implement in a dynamic language with the features of CLOS (Multiple Inheritance, Mixins, Multimethods, Metaclasses, Method combinations, ...).&lt;ref&gt;[http://norvig.com/design-patterns/ppframe.htm Peter Norvig, Design Patterns in Dynamic Programming]&lt;/ref&gt;
Several extensions to Common Lisp for object-oriented programming have been proposed to be included into the ANSI Common Lisp standard, but eventually CLOS was adopted as the standard object-system for Common Lisp. CLOS is a [[dynamic programming language|dynamic]] object system with [[multiple dispatch]] and [[multiple inheritance]], and differs radically from the OOP facilities found in static languages such as [[C++]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. As a dynamic object system, CLOS allows changes at runtime to generic functions and classes. Methods can be added and removed, classes can be added and redefined, objects can be updated for class changes and the class of objects can be changed.

CLOS has been integrated into ANSI Common Lisp. Generic Functions can be used like normal functions and are a first-class data type. Every CLOS class is integrated into the Common Lisp type system. Many Common Lisp types have a corresponding class. There is more potential use of CLOS for Common Lisp. The specification does not say whether conditions are implemented with CLOS. Pathnames and streams could be implemented with CLOS. These further usage possibilities of CLOS for ANSI Common Lisp are not part of the standard. Actual Common Lisp implementations are using CLOS for pathnames, streams, input/output, conditions, the implementation of CLOS itself and more.

==Compiler and Interpreter==
Several implementations of earlier Lisp dialects provided both an interpreter and a compiler. Unfortunately often the semantics were different. These earlier Lisps implemented lexical scoping in the compiler and dynamic scoping in the interpreter. Common Lisp requires that both the interpreter and compiler use lexical scoping by default. The Common Lisp standard describes both the semantics of the interpreter and a compiler. The compiler can be called using the function ''compile'' for individual functions and using the function ''compile-file'' for files. Common Lisp allows type declarations and provides ways to influence the compiler code generation policy. For the latter various optimization qualities can be given values between 0 (not important) and 3 (most important): ''speed'', ''space'', ''safety'', ''debug'' and ''compilation-speed''.

There is also a function to evaluate Lisp code: ''eval''. ''eval'' takes code as pre-parsed s-expressions and not, like in some other languages, as text strings. This way code can be constructed with the usual Lisp functions for constructing lists and symbols and then this code can be evaluate with ''eval''. Several Common Lisp implementations (like Clozure CL and SBCL) are implementing ''eval'' using their compiler. This way code is compiled, even though it is evaluated using the function ''eval''.

The file compiler is invoked using the function ''compile-file''.  The generated file with compiled code is called a ''fasl'' (from ''fast load'') file. These ''fasl'' files and also source code files can be loaded with the function ''load'' into a running Common Lisp system. Depending on the implementation, the file compiler generates byte-code (for example for the [[Java Virtual Machine]]), [[C (programming language)|C language]] code (which then is compiled with a C compiler) or, directly, native code.

Common Lisp implementations can be used interactively, even though the code gets fully compiled. The idea of an [[Interpreted language]] thus does not apply for interactive Common Lisp.

==Code examples==
===Birthday paradox===
The following program calculates the smallest number of people in a room for whom the probability of completely unique birthdays is less than 50% (the so-called [[birthday paradox]], where for 1 person the probability is obviously 100%, for 2 it is 364/365, etc.) (answer = 23).

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defconstant +year-size+ 365)

(defun birthday-paradox (probability number-of-people)
  (let ((new-probability (* (/ (- +year-size+ number-of-people)
                               +year-size+)
                            probability)))
    (if (&lt; new-probability 0.5)
        (1+ number-of-people)
        (birthday-paradox new-probability (1+ number-of-people)))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Calling the example function using the [[REPL]] (Read Eval Print Loop):
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
CL-USER &gt; (birthday-paradox 1.0 1)
23
&lt;/source&gt;

===Sorting a list of person objects===

We define a class PERSON and a method for displaying the name and age of a person.
Next we define a group of persons as a list of PERSON objects.
Then we iterate over the sorted list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defclass person ()
  ((name :initarg :name :accessor person-name)
   (age  :initarg :age  :accessor person-age))
  (:documentation &quot;The class PERSON with slots NAME and AGE.&quot;))

(defmethod display ((object person) stream)
  &quot;Displaying a PERSON object to an output stream.&quot;
  (with-slots (name age) object
    (format stream &quot;~a (~a)&quot; name age)))

(defparameter *group*
  (list (make-instance 'person :name &quot;Bob&quot;   :age 33)
        (make-instance 'person :name &quot;Chris&quot; :age 16)
        (make-instance 'person :name &quot;Ash&quot;   :age 23))
  &quot;A list of PERSON objects.&quot;)

(dolist (person (sort (copy-list *group*)
                      #'&gt;
                      :key #'person-age))
  (display person *standard-output*)
  (terpri))
&lt;/source&gt;

It prints the three names with descending age.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Bob (33)
Ash (23)
Chris (16)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Exponentiating by squaring===

Use of the LOOP macro is demonstrated:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun power (x n)
  (loop with result = 1
        while (plusp n)
        when (oddp n) do (setf result (* result x))
        do (setf x (* x x)
                 n (truncate n 2))
        finally (return result)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Example use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
CL-USER &gt; (power 2 200)
1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
&lt;/source&gt;

Compare with the built in exponentiation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
CL-USER &gt; (= (expt 2 200) (power 2 200))
T
&lt;/source&gt;

===Find the list of available shells===

WITH-OPEN-FILE is a macro that opens a file and provides a stream. When the form is returning, the file is automatically closed. FUNCALL calls a function object. The LOOP collects all lines that match the predicate.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun list-matching-lines (file predicate)
  &quot;Returns a list of lines in file, for which the predicate applied to
 the line returns T.&quot;
  (with-open-file (stream file)
    (loop for line = (read-line stream nil nil)
          while line
          when (funcall predicate line)
          collect it)))
&lt;/source&gt;

The function AVAILABLE-SHELLS calls above function LIST-MATCHING-LINES with a pathname and an anonymous function as the predicate. The predicate returns the pathname of a shell or NIL (if the string is not the filename of a shell).

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun available-shells (&amp;optional (file #p&quot;/etc/shells&quot;))
  (list-matching-lines
   file
   (lambda (line)
     (and (plusp (length line))
          (char= (char line 0) #\/)
          (pathname
           (string-right-trim '(#\space #\tab) line))))))
&lt;/source&gt;

An example call using Mac OS X 10.6:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
CL-USER &gt; (available-shells)
(#P&quot;/bin/bash&quot; #P&quot;/bin/csh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/ksh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/sh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/tcsh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/zsh&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comparison with other Lisps==
&lt;!-- needs lots --&gt;
Common Lisp is most frequently compared with, and contrasted to, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]&amp;mdash;if only because they are the two most popular Lisp dialects. Scheme predates CL, and comes not only from the same Lisp tradition but from some of the same engineers—[[Guy L. Steele, Jr.|Guy L. Steele]], with whom [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] designed Scheme, chaired the standards committee for Common Lisp.

Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as [[Emacs Lisp]] and [[AutoLISP]] which are embedded extension languages in particular products. Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]) uses lexical variable [[scope (programming)|scope]] by default for both interpreted and compiled code.

Most of the Lisp systems whose designs contributed to Common Lisp—such as [[ZetaLisp]] and Franz Lisp—used dynamically [[scope (programming)|scoped]] variables in their interpreters and lexically scoped variables in their compilers. Scheme introduced the sole use of lexically scoped variables to Lisp; an inspiration from [[ALGOL 68]] which was widely recognized as a good idea. CL supports dynamically scoped variables as well, but they must be explicitly declared as &quot;special&quot;. There are no differences in scoping between ANSI CL interpreters and compilers.

Common Lisp is sometimes termed a ''Lisp-2'' and Scheme a ''Lisp-1'', referring to CL's use of separate namespaces for functions and variables. (In fact, CL has ''many'' namespaces, such as those for go tags, block names, and &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; keywords.) There is a long-standing controversy between CL and Scheme advocates over the tradeoffs involved in multiple namespaces. In Scheme, it is (broadly) necessary to avoid giving variables names which clash with functions; Scheme functions frequently have arguments named &lt;code&gt;lis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lst&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;lyst&lt;/code&gt; so as not to conflict with the system function &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;. However, in CL it is necessary to explicitly refer to the function namespace when passing a function as an argument—which is also a common occurrence, as in the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; example above.

CL also differs from Scheme in its handling of boolean values. Scheme uses the special values #t and #f to represent truth and falsity. CL follows the older Lisp convention of using the symbols T and NIL, with NIL standing also for the empty list. In CL, ''any'' non-NIL value is treated as true by conditionals, such as &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, whereas in Scheme all non-#f values are treated as true. These conventions allow some operators in both languages to serve both as predicates (answering a boolean-valued question) and as returning a useful value for further computation, but in Scheme the value '() which is equivalent to NIL in Common Lisp evaluates to true in a boolean expression.

Lastly, the Scheme standards documents require [[tail recursion|tail-call optimization]], which the CL standard does not. Most CL implementations do offer tail-call optimization, although often only when the programmer uses an optimization directive. Nonetheless, common CL coding style does not favor the ubiquitous use of recursion that Scheme style prefers—what a Scheme programmer would express with tail recursion, a CL user would usually express with an iterative expression in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dolist&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;, or (more recently) with the &lt;code&gt;iterate&lt;/code&gt; package.

==Implementations==

See the Category [[:Category:Common Lisp implementations|Common Lisp implementations]].

Common Lisp is defined by a specification (like [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]) rather than by one implementation (like [[Perl]] before version 6). There are many implementations, and the standard details areas in which they may validly differ.

In addition, implementations tend to come with library packages, which provide functionality not covered in the standard. [[Free and open source software]] libraries have been created to support such features in a portable way, and are most notably found in the repositories of the [http://common-lisp.net/ Common-Lisp.net] and [http://clocc.sourceforge.net/ Common Lisp Open Code Collection] projects.

Common Lisp implementations may use any mix of native code compilation, byte code compilation or interpretation. Common Lisp has been designed to support [[incremental compiler]]s, file compilers and block compilers. Standard declarations to optimize compilation (such as function inlining or type specialization) are proposed in the language specification. Most Common Lisp implementations compile source code to native [[machine code]]. Some implementations can create (optimized) stand-alone applications. Others compile to interpreted [[bytecode]], which is less efficient than native code, but eases binary-code portability. There are also compilers that compile Common Lisp code to C code. The misconception that Lisp is a purely interpreted language is most likely because Lisp environments provide an interactive prompt and that code is compiled one-by-one, in an incremental way. With Common Lisp incremental compilation is widely used.

Some [[Unix]]-based implementations ([[CLISP]], [[SBCL]]) can be used as a [[scripting language]]; that is, invoked by the system transparently in the way that a [[Perl]] or [[Unix shell]] interpreter is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/quickstart.html#quickstart-unix CLISP as a scripting language under Unix]&lt;/ref&gt;

; [http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/ Armed Bear Common Lisp] : A CL implementation that runs on the [[Java Virtual Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/ | title = Armed Bear Common Lisp }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a compiler to [[Java byte code]], and allows access to Java libraries from CL. It was formerly just a component of the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/armedbear-j/ Armed Bear J Editor].
; [[CLISP]] : A bytecode-compiling implementation, portable and runs on a number of Unix and Unix-like systems (including [[Mac OS X]]), as well as Microsoft Windows and several other systems.
; [[Clozure CL]] (CCL) : Originally a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] fork of Macintosh Common Lisp. As that history implies, CCL was written for the Macintosh, but Clozure CL now runs on [[Mac OS X]],  [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. 32 and 64 bit [[x86]] ports are supported on each platform. Additionally there are Power PC ports for Mac OS and Linux. CCL was previously known as OpenMCL, but that name is no longer used, to avoid confusion with the open source version of Macintosh Common Lisp.
; [[CMUCL]] : Originally from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], now maintained as [[free and open source software]] by a group of volunteers. CMUCL uses a fast native-code compiler. It is available on [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] for Intel x86; [[Linux]] for Alpha; [[Mac OS X]] for Intel x86 and PowerPC; and Solaris, IRIX, and HP-UX on their native platforms.
; [[Embeddable Common Lisp]] (ECL) : ECL includes a bytecode interpreter and compiler. It can also compile Lisp code to machine code via a C compiler. ECL then compiles Lisp code to C, compiles the C code with a C compiler and can then load the resulting machine code. It is also possible to embed ECL in [[C (programming language)|C]] programs, and C code into Common Lisp programs.
; [[GNU Common Lisp]] (GCL) : The [[GNU]] Project's Lisp compiler. Not yet fully ANSI-compliant, GCL is however the implementation of choice for several large projects including the mathematical tools [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], [[AXIOM]] and [[ACL2]]. GCL runs on [[Linux]] under eleven different architectures, and also under Windows, Solaris, and [[FreeBSD]].

; [[Poplog]] : Poplog implements a version of CL, with [[POP-11]], and optionally [[Prolog]], and [[Standard ML]] (SML), allowing mixed language programming. For all, the implementation language is POP-11, which is compiled incrementally. It also has an integrated [[Emacs]]-like editor that communicates with the compiler.
; [[Steel Bank Common Lisp]] (SBCL) : A branch from [[CMUCL]]. &quot;Broadly speaking, SBCL is distinguished from CMU CL by a greater emphasis on maintainability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/history.html

 | title = Platform Table | work = Steel Bank Common Lisp
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has experimental support for running on Windows. SBCL does not use an interpreter by default; all expressions are compiled to native code unless the user switches the interpreter on. The SBCL compiler generates fast native code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=all SBCL ranks above other dynamic language implementations in the 'Computer Language Benchmark Game']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

See the Category [[:Category:Common Lisp software|Common Lisp software]].

Common Lisp is used to develop research applications (often in Artificial Intelligence), for rapid development of prototypes or for deployed applications.

Common Lisp is used in many commercial applications, including the [[Yahoo!]] Store web-commerce site, which originally involved [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] and was later rewritten in C++ and Perl.&lt;ref name=&quot;doubt-not-corporate-foolishness&quot;&gt;&quot;In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written in C++ and Perl. It's hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code.&quot; [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], [http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html Beating the Averages]&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include:

* [[ACT-R]], a cognitive architecture used in a large number of research projects.
* Authorizer's Assistant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/IAAI/1989/IAAI89-031.pdf  Authorizer's Assistant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prenhall.com/divisions/bp/app/alter/student/useful/ch9amex.html American Express Authorizer's Assistant]&lt;/ref&gt; a large rule-based system used by American Express, analyzing credit requests.
* [[Cyc]], a long running project with the aim to create a knowledge-based system that provides a huge amount of common sense knowledge
* The [[Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool]] (DART), which is said to alone have paid back during the years from 1991 to 1995 for all thirty years of [[DARPA]] investments in AI research.
* [http://www.gensym.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=54 G2] from Gensym, a real-time business rules engine (BRE)
* The development environment for the [[Jak and Daxter]] video game series, developed by [[Naughty Dog]].
* [[ITA Software]]'s low fare search engine, used by travel websites such as [[Orbitz]] and [[Kayak.com]] and airlines such as [[American Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] and [[US Airways]].
* [[Mirai (software)|Mirai]], a 3d graphics suite. It was used to animate the face of Gollum in the movie Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
* [[Prototype Verification System]] (PVS), a mechanized environment for formal specification and verification.
* [http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL/ PWGL] is a sophisticated visual programming environment based on Common Lisp, used in [[Computer assisted composition]] and sound synthesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:25 pair color code chart.svg|right|thumb|100px|25 Pair Color Code Chart used in certain kinds of wiring.]]
A '''color code''' is a system for displaying information by using different [[color]]s. Color codes are often difficult for [[color blindness|color blind]] and blind people to interpret.

The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long distance communication by use of flags, as in [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers: Volume 29'' (1893), p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein [[red]] signified [[Risk|danger]] and [[white]] signified [[safety]], with other colors having similar assignments of meaning. 

As chemistry and other technologies advanced, it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar, such as [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] in electrical and electronic devices, and pharmaceutical [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]]. 

The use of color codes has been extended to abstractions, such as the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] color code in the United States. Similarly, [[hospital emergency codes]] often incorporate colors (such as the widely used &quot;Code Blue&quot; indicating a [[cardiac arrest]]), although they may also include numbers, and may not conform to a uniform standard.

==Examples==
Systems incorporating color coding include:

*[[Artillery shell]]s and other munitions, which are color coded according to their pyrotechnic contents
*[[Bottled gas]]es
*[[ColorCode 3D]] stereo image system using blue/amber viewing glasses
*[[Electrical wiring]] — AC power phase, neutral, and grounding wires
*[[Electronic color code]] — for electronic components
*[[Fire extinguisher]]s
*[[Handkerchief code]]
*[[Jump start (vehicle)|Jumper cables]] used to jump-start a vehicle
*[[Navigation light]]
*[[Sea mark]]
*[[Characteristic light]]
*[[Color coding of optical fibers|Optical fibers]]
*[[PC System Design Guide#Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports|PC connectors and ports]]
*[[Ribbon]] colors ''see:'' [[:Category:Ribbon symbolism]]
*[[Three-phase electric power#Color codes|Three-phase electric power]] (electrical wiring)
*[[Traffic light]]s
*[[25-pair color code]] — telecommunications wiring
*[[Utility color code|Underground utility location]]
*[[Web colors]] for HTML color codes

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration.png|right|thumb|250px|The plot of a Cauchy sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n),&lt;/math&gt; shown in blue, as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;x_n.&lt;/math&gt; If the space containing the sequence is complete, the &quot;ultimate destination&quot; of this sequence, that is, the limit, exists.]]
[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration2.png|right|thumb|250px|A sequence that is not Cauchy. The elements of the sequence fail to get close to each other as the sequence progresses.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''Cauchy sequence''' (pronounced {{IPA|[koˈʃi]}}), named after [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], is a [[sequence]] whose elements become ''arbitrarily close to each other'' as the sequence progresses. To be more precise, given any positive number, we can always drop some terms from the start of the sequence, so that the maximum of the [[metric (mathematics)|distances]] between any two of the remaining elements is smaller than that number.

In other words, suppose a pre-assigned positive real value ε is chosen.
However small ε is, starting from a Cauchy sequence and eliminating terms one by one from the start, after a finite number of steps, any pair chosen from the remaining terms will  be within distance ε of each other.

&lt;!--
&quot;Because Cauchy sequences require the notion of distance, they can only be defined in a [[metric space]].&quot;

Later in the article the definition of a Cauchy sequence in a topological vector space is given.
--&gt;The utility of Cauchy sequences lies in the fact that in a [[complete metric space]] (one where all such sequences are known to [[limit of a sequence|converge to a limit]]), the criterion for convergence depends only on the terms of the sequence itself. This is often exploited in algorithms, both theoretical and applied,  where an iterative process can be shown relatively easily to produce a Cauchy sequence, consisting of the iterates.

The notions above are not as unfamiliar as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance of the fact that any real number ''x'' has a decimal expansion is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive truncations of the decimal expansion of ''x'') has the real limit ''x''. In some cases it may be difficult to describe ''x'' independently of such a limiting process involving rational numbers.

Generalizations of Cauchy sequences in more abstract [[uniform spaces]] exist in the form of [[Cauchy filter]] and [[Cauchy net]].

==Real numbers==
A sequence 

:&lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

of real numbers is called ''Cauchy'', if for every [[positive and negative numbers|positive]] real number ''ε'', there is a positive [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all natural numbers ''m'', ''n'' &gt; ''N''

:&lt;math&gt;|x_m - x_n| &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;

where the vertical bars denote the [[absolute value]].  In a similar way one can define Cauchy sequences of rational or complex numbers.  Cauchy formulated such a condition by requiring &lt;math&gt;x_m - x_n&lt;/math&gt; to be [[infinitesimal]] for every pair of infinite ''m, n''.

==In a metric space==

To define Cauchy sequences in any metric space, the absolute value &lt;math&gt;|x_m - x_n| \,&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the ''distance'' &lt;math&gt;d(x_m, x_n) \,&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x_m\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n\,&lt;/math&gt;. 

Formally, given a [[metric space]] (''M'', ''d''), a sequence

:&lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

is Cauchy, if for every positive [[real number]] ''ε'' &gt; 0 there is a positive  [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all natural numbers ''m'',''n'' &gt; ''N'', the distance 

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_m, x_n) &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Roughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to have a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] in ''M''. Nonetheless, such a limit does not always exist within ''M''.

==Completeness==
A metric space ''X'' in which every Cauchy sequence has a limit in ''X'' is called [[Complete metric space|complete]].

===Examples===
The [[real number]]s are complete, and one of the standard [[Construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] involves Cauchy sequences of [[rational number]]s. 

A rather different type of example is afforded by a metric space ''X'' which has the [[metric space|discrete metric]] (where any two distinct  points are at distance ''1'' from each other). Any Cauchy sequence of elements of ''X'' must be constant beyond some fixed point, and converges to the eventually repeating term.

===Counter-example: rational numbers===
The [[rational number]]s '''Q''' are not complete (for the usual distance):&lt;br/&gt;
There are sequences of rationals that converge (in '''R''') to [[irrational number]]s; these are Cauchy sequences having no limit in '''Q'''. In fact, if a real number ''x'' is irrational, then the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), whose ''n''-th term is the truncation to ''n'' decimal places of the decimal expansion of ''x'', gives a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers with irrational limit ''x''. Irrational numbers certainly exist, for example:

* The sequence defined by &lt;math&gt; x_0=1, x_{n+1}=\frac{x_n+\frac{2}{x_n}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; consists of rational numbers (1, 3/2, 17/12,...), which is clear from the definition; however it converges to the [[irrational number|irrational]] square root of two, see [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|Babylonian method of computing square root]].
* The sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n = F_n / F_{n-1}\,&lt;/math&gt; of ratios of consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s which, if it converges at all, converges to a limit &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\phi^2 = \phi+1&lt;/math&gt;, and no rational number has this property.  If one considers this as a sequence of real numbers, however, it converges to the real number &lt;math&gt;\varphi = (1+\sqrt5)/2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Golden ratio]], which is irrational.
* The values of the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(''x''), sin(''x''), cos(''x''), are known to be irrational for any rational value of ''x''≠0, but each can be defined as the limit of a rational Cauchy sequence, using, for instance, the [[Maclaurin series]].

===Counter-example: open interval===
The open interval &lt;math&gt;X=(0, 2)\,&lt;/math&gt; in the set of real numbers with an ordinary distance in '''R''' is not a complete space: there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n=\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; in it, which is Cauchy (for arbitrarily small distance bound &lt;math&gt;d&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; all terms &lt;math&gt;x_n\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n &gt; \tfrac{1}{d}&lt;/math&gt; fit in the &lt;math&gt;(0, d)\,&lt;/math&gt; interval), however does not converge in ''X''—its 'limit', number 0, does not belong to the space ''X''.

===Other properties===

* Every convergent sequence (with limit ''s'', say) is a Cauchy sequence, since, given any real number ''ε'' &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point, every term of sequence is within distance ''ε/2'' of ''s'', so any two terms of the sequence are within distance ''ε'' of each other.
* Every Cauchy sequence of real (or complex) numbers is [[bounded function|bounded]] (since for some ''N'', all terms of the sequence from the ''N''-th onwards are within distance ''1'' of each other, and if ''M'' is the largest absolute value of the terms up to and including the ''N''-th, then no term of the sequence has absolute value greater than ''M''+''1'').
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence with limit ''s'' is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number ''r'' &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance ''r''/''2'' of ''s'', and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance ''r''/''2'' of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance ''r'' of ''s''.

These last two properties, together with a lemma used in the proof of the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. The lemma in question states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. Given this fact, every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the [[least upper bound axiom]]. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of ''constructing'' the real numbers as the {{ml|Completion_%28metric_space%29|Completion|completion}} of the rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.

One of the standard illustrations of the advantage of being able to work with Cauchy sequences and make use of completeness is provided by consideration of the summation of an [[infinite series]] of real numbers
(or, more generally, of elements of any complete normed linear space, or [[Banach space]]).  Such a series 
&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be convergent if and only if the sequence of [[partial sum]]s &lt;math&gt;(s_{m})&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, where 
&lt;math&gt; s_{m} = \sum_{n=1}^{m} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a routine matter 
to determine whether the sequence of partial sums is Cauchy or not,
since for positive integers ''p'' &gt; ''q'', 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; s_{p} - s_{q} = \sum_{n=q+1}^{p} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f \colon M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniformly continuous]] map between the metric spaces ''M'' and ''N'' and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence in ''M'', then &lt;math&gt;(f(x_n))&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in ''N''. If &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; are two Cauchy sequences in the rational, real or complex numbers, then the sum &lt;math&gt;(x_n + y_n)&lt;/math&gt; and the product &lt;math&gt;(x_n y_n)&lt;/math&gt; are also Cauchy sequences.

==Generalizations==
===In topological vector spaces===
There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence for a [[topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;: Pick a [[local base]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; about 0; then (&lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence if for all members &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, there is some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever 
&lt;math&gt;n,m &gt; N, 
x_n - x_m&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. If the topology of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with a [[translation-invariant metric]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the two definitions agree.

===In topological groups===

Since the topological vector space definition of Cauchy sequence requires only that there be a continuous &quot;subtraction&quot; operation, it can just as well be stated in the context of a [[topological group]]: A sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; in a topological group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence if for every open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the [[identity element|identity]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt; m,n&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n x_m^{-1} \in U&lt;/math&gt;. As above, it is sufficient to check this for the neighbourhoods in any local base of the identity in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

As in the [[Complete_metric_space#Completion|construction of the completion of a metric space]], one can furthermore define the binary relation on Cauchy sequences in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_k)&lt;/math&gt; are ''equivalent'' if there for every open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the identity in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; exists some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt; m,n&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n y_m^{-1} \in U&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is an [[equivalence relation]]. More precisely, it is reflexive since the sequences are Cauchy sequences. It is symmetric since &lt;math&gt;y_n x_m^{-1} = (x_m y_n^{-1})^{-1} \in U^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; which by continuity of the inverse is another open neighbourhood of the identity. It is transitive since &lt;math&gt;x_n z_l^{-1} = x_n y_m^{-1} y_m z_l^{-1} \in U' U''&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U''&lt;/math&gt; are open neighbourhoods of the identity such that &lt;math&gt;U'U'' \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;; such pairs exist by the continuity of the group operation.

===In groups===

There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence in a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:
Let &lt;math&gt;H=(H_r)&lt;/math&gt; be a decreasing sequence of normal subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].
Then a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be Cauchy (w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) [[if and only if]] for any &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; there is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall m,n &gt; N, x_n x_m^{-1} \in H_r&lt;/math&gt;.

Technically, this is the same thing as a topological group Cauchy sequence for a particular choice of topology on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, namely that for which &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a local base.

The set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of such Cauchy sequences forms a group (for the componentwise product), and the set &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; of null sequences (s.th. &lt;math&gt;\forall r, \exists N, \forall n &gt; N, x_n \in H_r&lt;/math&gt;) is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. The [[factor group]] &lt;math&gt;C/C_0&lt;/math&gt; is called the completion of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

One can then show that this completion is isomorphic to the [[inverse limit]] of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(G/H_r)&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of this construction, familiar in [[number theory]]
and [[algebraic geometry]] is the construction of the ''p-adic completion'' of the integers with respect to a prime ''p.'' In this case, ''G'' is the integers under addition, and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the additive subgroup consisting of integer multiples of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] sequence (i.e., any normal subgroup of finite index contains some &lt;math&gt;H_r&lt;/math&gt;), then this completion is [[canonical]] in the sense that it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of &lt;math&gt;(G/H)_H&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; varies over ''all'' normal subgroups of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].
For further details, see ch. I.10 in [[Serge Lang|Lang]]'s &quot;Algebra&quot;.

==In constructive mathematics==

In [[constructive mathematics]], Cauchy sequences often must be given with a ''modulus of Cauchy convergence'' to be useful. If &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then a modulus of Cauchy convergence for the sequence is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; from the set of [[natural number]]s to itself, such that &lt;math&gt;\forall k \forall m, n &gt; \alpha(k), |x_m - x_n| &lt; 1/k&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, any sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse (that every Cauchy sequence has a modulus) follows from the [[well-ordering property]] of the natural numbers (let &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k)&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest possible &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of Cauchy sequence, taking &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt;). However, this well-ordering property does not hold in constructive mathematics (it is equivalent to the principle of [[excluded middle]]). On the other hand, this converse also follows (directly) from the principle of [[dependent choice]] (in fact, it will follow from the weaker AC&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;), which is generally accepted by constructive mathematicians. Thus, moduli of Cauchy convergence are needed directly only by constructive mathematicians who (like [[Fred Richman]]) do not wish to use any form of choice.

That said, using a modulus of Cauchy convergence can simplify both definitions and theorems in constructive analysis. Perhaps even more useful are ''regular Cauchy sequences'', sequences with a given modulus of Cauchy convergence (usually &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k) = k&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k) = 2^k&lt;/math&gt;). Any Cauchy sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is equivalent (in the sense used to form the [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of a metric space) to a regular Cauchy sequence; this can be proved without using any form of the axiom of choice. Regular Cauchy sequences were used by [[Errett Bishop]] in his [http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7I-AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Foundations+intitle:of+intitle:constructive+intitle:analysis&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;pgis=1 Foundations of Constructive Analysis], but they have also been used by [[Douglas Bridges]] in a non-constructive textbook (ISBN 978-0-387-98239-7). However, Bridges also works on mathematical constructivism; the concept has not spread far outside of that milieu.
==In a hyperreal continuum==
A real sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle u_n: n\in \mathbb{N} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a natural [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension, defined for [[hypernatural]] values ''H'' of the index ''n'' in addition to the usual natural ''n''.  The sequence is Cauchy if and only if for every infinite ''H'' and ''K'', the values &lt;math&gt;u_H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_K&lt;/math&gt; are infinitely close, or [[adequality|adequal]], i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;\, \mathrm{st}(u_H-u_K)= 0&lt;/math&gt; 
where &quot;st&quot; is the [[standard part function]].

'''Common Era''', abbreviated as '''CE''', is a designation for the world's most commonly used year-numbering system.&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE: the sentence does NOT say that CE/BCE is the most commonly used DESIGNATION. &quot;Most commonly used&quot; clearly describes/modifies the year-numbering system.---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#calendar-gregorian | work=The Astronomical Almanac: Online! | title=calendar, Gregorian | year=2010 | publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory]] | accessdate=2011-05-18 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Inserted &quot;Before Christ&quot; again because it directly relates to corresponding &quot;BC&quot; portion of &quot;(BC/AD) notation&quot;. It explicitly defines what &quot;BC&quot; is without following the link. It's also confusing otherwise to new readers who have only seen &quot;BCE&quot; and now suddenly see &quot;BC&quot;. And regardless of being culturally neutral or not, it is accurate as being EXACTLY what it means. Perhaps that should be factored in? ---&gt;
The numbering of years using Common Era notation is identical to the numbering used with &quot;Before Christ / ''[[Anno Domini]]''&quot; (BC/AD) notation, {{CURRENTYEAR}} being the current year in both notations and neither using a [[year zero]].&lt;ref&gt;
Two separate systems that also do not use religious titles, the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical system]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard do use a [[year zero]]. The year 1 BCE (identical to the year 1 BC) is represented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently, ISO 8601 dating requires usage of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, however; whereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow usage of the Julian calendar for dates before 1582 CE.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Common Era is also known as '''Christian Era'''&lt;ref&gt;

Both the BCE/CE and BC/AD notations are based on a sixth-century estimate for the year in which [[Jesus]] was conceived or born, with the ''common era'' designation originating among Christians in Europe at least as early as 1615 (at first in [[Latin]]).&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1

The [[Gregorian calendar]], and the year-numbering system associated with it, is the calendar system with most widespread usage in the world today. For decades, it has been the ''de facto'' global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Universal Postal Union]].
There are many names in many languages used to designate this year-numbering system that originated in Western Europe.
Common Era notation has been adopted in several non-Christian cultures and by many scholars in religious studies and other academic fields&lt;ref name=Irvin /&gt;

The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Diocletian]] years, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt; He attempted to number years from an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Jesus]],&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt;
although scholars today generally agree that he miscalculated by a small number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html &quot;Calendars&quot;] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, p. 579.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Dionysius labeled the column of the Easter table in which he introduced the new era &quot;''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, O., (1983), &quot;The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church&quot; in Coyne, G.V. et al. (Eds.) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/book/grc../1983//0000052.000.html ''The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar''], Vatican Observatory, p. 52.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Numbering years in this manner became more widespread with its usage by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before the supposed year of birth&lt;ref&gt;Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.
&lt;/ref&gt;
of Jesus, and the practice of not using a year [[zero]].&lt;ref&gt;As noted in [[Zero#History of zero]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the 12th century.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron /&gt;

The term &quot;Common Era&quot; is traced back in English to its appearance as &quot;Vulgar&lt;ref&gt;
It is relatively recently the word ''vulgar'' has come to mean &quot;crudely indecent&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
Era&quot; (from the Latin word ''vulgus'', the common people, i.e. those who are not royalty), to distinguish it from the [[Regnal year|regnal dating]] systems typically used in national law. The first use of the Latin equivalent (''vulgaris aerae'')&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae0&gt;In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Vulgaris Aerae''. It also occasionally appears as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.
&lt;/ref&gt;
discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1

Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae2&gt;

In 1835, in his book ''Living Oracles'', [[Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)|Alexander Campbell]], wrote: &quot;The vulgar Era, or Anno Domini; the fourth year of Jesus Christ, the first of which was but eight days&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |url=http://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/acampbell/tlo4/TLO400L4.HTM |title=The Living Oracles, Fourth Edition |year=1835 |author=[[Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)|Alexander Campbell]] |pages=16–20 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
and also refers to the ''common era'' as a synonym for ''vulgar era'' with &quot;the fact that our Lord was born on the 4th year before the vulgar era, called Anno Domini, thus making (for example) the 42d year from his birth to correspond with the 38th of the common era...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' uses the sentence: &quot;Foremost among these [various eras] is that which is now adopted by all civilized peoples and known as the Christian, Vulgar or Common Era, in the twentieth century of which we are now living.&quot;&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron /&gt;
During the 19th century, &quot;Vulgar Era&quot; came to be contrasted with &quot;Christian Era&quot;, and &quot;vulgar&quot; came to mean &quot;crudely indecent&quot;, thus no longer a synonym for &quot;common&quot;.

The phrase &quot;common era&quot;, in [[lower case]], also appeared in the 19th century in a ''generic'' sense, not necessarily to refer to the Christian Era, but to any system of dates in common use throughout a civilization. Thus, &quot;the common era of the Jews&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

Some Jewish academics were already using the ''CE'' and ''BCE'' abbreviations by the mid-19th century, such as in 1856, when Rabbi and historian, [[Morris Jacob Raphall]] used the abbreviation in his book, [http://books.google.com/books?id=r7CbDH5hTe8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=CE+BCE ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews''].&lt;ref&gt;
The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.

&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1825, a different abbreviation, VE, had already been in use among Jews to denote years on the Western calendar.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/susser/plymouthinscriptions.htm |title=Plymouth, England Tombstone inscriptions |publisher=Jewish Communities &amp; Records |quote=Here is buried his honour Judah ben his honour Joseph, a prince and honoured amongst philanthropists, who executed good deeds, died in his house in the City of Bath, Tuesday, and was buried here on Sunday, 19 Sivan in the year 5585.

&lt;br/&gt;[19 Sivan 5585 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] is June 5, 1825. VE is likely an abbreviation for ''Vulgar Era''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Era Vulgaris===
An adapted translation of ''Common Era'' into Latin as ''Era Vulgaris'' was adopted in the 20th century by some followers of [[Aleister Crowley]], and thus the abbreviation &quot;e.v.&quot; or &quot;EV&quot; may sometimes be seen as a replacement for AD.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The terms &quot;Common Era&quot;, &quot;''Anno Domini''&quot;, &quot;Before the Common Era&quot; and &quot;Before Christ&quot; can be applied to dates that rely on either the [[Julian calendar]] or the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Modern dates are understood in the [[Western world]] to be in the Gregorian calendar, but for older dates writers should specify the calendar used. Dates in the Gregorian calendar in the Western world have always used the era designated in English as ''Anno Domini'' or ''Common Era'', but over the millennia a wide variety of eras have been used with the Julian calendar.

Although Jews have their own [[Hebrew calendar]], they often find it necessary to use the Gregorian Calendar as well. The reasons for some using Common Era notation are described below:{{Cquote |Jews do not generally use the words &quot;A.D.&quot; and &quot;B.C.&quot; to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. &quot;A.D.&quot; means &quot;the year of our [[L-rd]],&quot; &lt;!-- THIS IS NOT AN ERROR. This cited quote uses the expression &quot;L-rd&quot;. Wikipedia does not &quot;correct&quot; direct quotations. There is a tradition in Judaism to not write out the full name of God, so that it cannot be defaced. DO NOT EDIT THIS QUOTE --&gt; and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd.  Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). |author=Tracey R Rich|source=[http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years Judaism 101]|accessdate=2011-05-18}}

Common Era notation has also been in use for Hebrew lessons for &quot;more than a century&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt;

Some American academics in the fields of [[education]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide &quot;Do not use C.E. (current era) ... or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C.&quot; {{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/publications/style_guide.htm#V-d |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |month=December |year=2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070618004627/http://www.sha.org/publications/style_guide.htm#V-d &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 18 June 2007 |accessdate = 2011-05-18}}.

The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, which is the leading publishing body of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], has been using CE and BCE exclusively in its publications (except in quotations) since ''The Watchtower'' of 15 April 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower Library 2009, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.co.uk/search?as_q=BCE&amp;hl=en&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=watchtower.org%2F&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images BCE site:watchtower.org/] [http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=BC+site%3Awatchtower.org%2F&amp;meta= BC site:watchtower.org/] Also see, for example, comment &quot;In this publication, instead of the traditional 'AD' and 'BC', the more accurate 'CE' (Common Era) and 'BCE' (before the Common Era) are used.&quot; in ''The Bible — God's Word or Man's?'', p. 16 footnote, published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;
More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world: The [[Smithsonian Institution]] prefers Common Era usage, though individual museums are not required to use it.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/field_trips/standards/world_history_standards.html |title=World History Standards |accessdate=9 September 2006 |author=Smithsonian Institution |work=Smithsonian Education |archiveurl = http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070928000917/http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/field_trips/standards/world_history_standards.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 September 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.&lt;ref&gt;
- {{cite journal |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070612143226/http://www.egyptstudy.org/ostracon/guidelines.html |journal=The Ostracon &amp;mdash; Journal of the Egyptian Studies Society |title=Submission Guidelines for ''The Ostracon'' |quote=For dates, please use the now-standard &quot;BCE-CE&quot; notation, rather than &quot;BC-AD.&quot; Authors with strong religious preferences may use &quot;BC-AD,&quot; however. |accessdate=2011-05-18}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide &amp; Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s is growing.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt; Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]].
Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18}};{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2006, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision that would have included the designations BCE and CE as part of state law, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of usage of BCE to BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=BC,BCE&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3

&lt;/ref&gt;
and CE to AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=century+AD,century+CE&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3 |title=Google Ngram Viewer |accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in books has changed dramatically between the years 1800 and 2008, particularly since 1980.

====Usage in other languages====
Some German texts use ''v. u. Z.'' (''vor unserer Zeitrechnung'', before our chronology) and ''u. Z.'' (''unserer Zeitrechnung'', of our chronology) instead of ''v. Chr.'' (''vor Christus'', before Christ) and ''n. Chr.'' (''nach Christus/Christi Geburt'', after Christ/the Nativity of Christ). The use of the terms still differs regionally and ideologically.
In [[Hungary]], similarly to the Bulgarian case, ''i. e.'' (''időszámításunk előtt'', before our era) and ''i. sz.'' (''időszámításunk szerint'', according to our era) are still widely used instead of traditional ''Kr. e.'' (''Krisztus előtt'', Before Christ) and ''Kr. u.'' (''Krisztus után'', After Christ), which were unofficially reinstituted after the Communist period.
In [[Poland]] generally the only used term is ''naszej ery/przed naszą erą'' (''of our era/before our era''). The terms ''przed Chrystusem/po Chrystusie'' (''before Christ/after Christ'') are possible but nearly never used in contemporary Poland. In [[Italy]] and other Latin countries, the use of &quot;a.e.v.&quot; and &quot;e.v.&quot;, meaning &quot;Ante Era Vulgaris&quot; and &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; or &quot;Era Volgare&quot; (common era), is increasing. In Portuguese-speaking countries, such as [[Brazil]] and [[Angola]], the abbreviations &quot;E.C.&quot; (&quot;Era Comum&quot;, Common Era) and &quot;A.E.C.&quot; (&quot;Antes da Era Comum&quot;, Before Common Era) are generally used.

In Asia, the Chinese use the term &quot;[[Chinese era name#How the Era System worked|Common Era]] (公元)&quot;.{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}} &lt;ref&gt;China Internet Information Center. [http://www.china.org.cn/english/archiveen/27750.htm Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Process of Founding and Key Achievements in History]. National People's Congress. Retrieved on: 12 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Center for East Asian Studies. &quot;[http://www.international.ucla.edu/eas/web/chinaweb.htm Calendar Conversion Help].&quot; China Via the Web. Retrieved on: 2010-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese use ''seireki'' (西暦), which translates to &quot;Western Calendar&quot;. The Koreans use the word ''Seogi'' (서기, 西紀), which means &quot;Western Era&quot; for AD/CE and ''Kiwonjeon'' (기원전, 紀元前) which is an abbreviation of ''Seoryok Kiwonjeon'' (서력기원전, 西曆紀元前) which means &quot;Before the Origin of the Western Calendar&quot;.

==Rationale==

A range of arguments has been presented for the adoption of the Common Era notation. The label ''Anno Domini'' is arguably inaccurate; &quot;scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before A.D. 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doggett |first=L. |chapter=Calendars |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |year=1992 |publisher=University Science Books |location=Sausalito, CA |isbn=0-935702-68-7 |editor=P. Kenneth Seidelmann |page=579}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christian]]s, but who are not themselves Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelTolrnc
&quot;/&gt;
Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] argued, &quot;[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures - different civilizations, if you like - that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;
Thus, the current year is written as {{CURRENTYEAR}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{CURRENTYEAR}} CE, or as AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[full stops]] (e.g., &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:87%;&quot;&gt;BCE&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or &quot;C.E.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The common era year of [[copyright]] for films and other media is often expressed in [[Roman numerals]]; thus a film made in {{CURRENTYEAR}} might be marked as &quot;&amp;copy;{{Roman|{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&quot;.

==Opposition==
&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: While there are undoubtedly several better arguments than the ones that exist here, for entries to stay here they need to be properly sourced --&gt;

Astrobiologist [[Duncan Steel]] argues that if one is going to replace BC/AD with BCE/CE then one should reject all aspects of the dating system (including time of day, days of the week and months of the year) as they all have origins related to pagan, astrological, Jewish and Christian beliefs. Steel makes note of the consistency of the [[Quaker#Calendar and church holy days|Quaker system]] (now rarely used), which removed all such references, and rejects religious arguments against BC/AD as selective.&lt;ref name=RelTolrnc/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;

Anthropologist [[Carol Delaney]] argues that the substitution of BC/AD to BCE/CE is merely a [[euphemism]] that conceals the political implications without modifying the actual source of contention.&lt;ref name=Delaney2004&gt;

English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that &quot;if we do end by casting aside the A.D./B.C. convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;
In fact, the very short lived [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] did just that, making year one the first year of the [[First French Republic]], and rejecting the seven day week (with its connections to Genesis) for a ten day week.

Some critics assert that the use of identifiers which have common spellings is more ambiguous than the use of identifiers with divergent spellings. Both CE and BCE have in common the letters &quot;CE&quot;, which is more likely to cause confusion, they claim, than identifiers with clearly different spelling.&lt;ref name=RelTolrnc/&gt;

===Christian opposition===
Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], the removal of reference to him in era notation is perceived by some Christians as offensive.&lt;ref&gt;

Some groups oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons; for example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] supports retaining the BC/AD abbreviations as &quot;a reminder of the preeminence of Christ and His gospel in world history&quot;.&lt;ref name=SBC /&gt;  The Southern Baptist Convention has criticized the use of BCE and CE as being the result of &quot;secularization, anti-supernaturalism, religious pluralism, and political correctness&quot; and encourages its members to &quot;retain the traditional method of dating and avoid this revisionism&quot;.&lt;ref name=SBC /&gt;

[[Raimon Panikkar]] claims that using the designation BCE/CE is a &quot;return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism&quot;  towards non-Christians who have not been sharing the era.&lt;ref name=Panikkar&gt;

|quote=Here is an example of the incarnation's historical-sociological implications among those who feel themselves furthest from Christianity. In certain North American academic circles one can see a return-with repercussions elsewhere-to the most bigoted Christian colonialism, along with the good intention of overcoming it. It has been suggested that the terminology of the Western calendar, Christian in origin, be replaced by one that presumably would be neutral and universal. It is understandable that some would protest the use of A.D. (anno Domini), but by eliminating B.C. (before Christ) and substituting B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) scholars betray the depths of the cultural impact of the historico-Christian event. After all, Jesus was not born in the year 1. We select a single event but without any value judgment. To call our age &quot;the Common Era,&quot; even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.
|accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet reaction===
According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the history teacher [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
One of its &quot;Conservapedia Commandments&quot; is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to &quot;deny the historical basis&quot; of the dating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia

|quote=The influence of western culture and scholarship upon the rest of the world in turn led to this system of dating becoming the most widely used one across the globe today. Many scholars in historical and religious studies in the West in recent years have sought to lessen the explicitly Christian meaning of this system without abandoning the usefulness of a single, common, global form of dating. For this reason the terms ''common era'' and ''before the common era'', abbreviated as CE and BCE, have grown in popularity as designations. The terms are meant, in deference to non-Christians, to soften the explicit theological claims made by the older Latin terminology, while at the same time providing continuity with earlier generations of mostly western Christian historical research.

'''Charles Robert Malden''' (9 August 1797 &amp;ndash; 23 May 1855), was a nineteenth century [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy|naval]] officer, surveyor and educator. Discoverer of [[Malden Island]] in the central [[Pacific]], which is named in his honour. Founder of the [[Windlesham House School]] at [[Brighton]], [[England]].

Malden was born in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]], son of Jonas Malden, a surgeon. He entered British naval service at the age of 11 on 22 June 1809. He served nine years as a volunteer 1st class, [[midshipman]], and [[mate]], including one year in the [[English Channel]] and [[Bay of Biscay]] (1809), four years at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and in the [[East Indies]] (1809–14), two and a half years on the North American and West Indian stations (1814–16), and a year and a half in the [[Mediterranean]] (1817–18). He was present at the capture of [[Mauritius]] and [[Java (island)|Java]], and at the battles of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] and [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]].

He passed the examination in the elements of [[mathematics]] and the theory of [[navigation]] at the [[Royal Naval College]]{{dn}} on 2–4 September 1816, and became a 1st Lieutenant on 1 September 1818. In eight years of active service as an officer, he served two and a half years in a surveying ship in the Mediterranean (1818–21), one and a half years in a surveying sloop in the English Channel and off the coast of [[Ireland]] (1823–24), and one and a half years as Surveyor of the frigate {{HMS|Blonde|1819|6}} during a voyage (1824–26) to and from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then known as the &quot;Sandwich islands&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;macrae&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=6aYcAAAAMAAJ |title= With Lord Byron at the Sandwich Islands in 1825: Being Extracts from the MS Diary of James Macrae, scottish botanist |year=1922 |author= James Macrae |editor= William Frederick Wilson |isbn= 9780554605265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Hawaii he surveyed harbours which, he noted, were &quot;said not to exist by Captains Cook and Vancouver.&quot; On the return voyage he discovered and explored uninhabited Malden Island in the central Pacific on 30 July 1825. After his return he left active service but remained at half pay. He served for several years as [[hydrographer]] to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]].

Malden married Frances Cole, daughter of Rev. William Hodgson Cole, rector of [[West Clandon]] and Vicar of [[Wonersh]], near [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], on 8 April 1828. He became the father of seven sons and a daughter.

From 1830-36 he took pupils for the Royal Navy at [[Ryde]], [[Isle of Wight]]. He purchased the school of [[Henry Worsley]] at [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]], Isle of Wight, in December 1836, reopened it as a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] on 20 February 1837, and moved it to Montpelier Road in Brighton in December 1837. He built the [[Windlesham House School]] at Brighton in 1844, and conducted the school until his death there in 1855.

The '''Chechen Republic''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|tʃ|ɨ|n}}; {{lang-ru|Чече́нская Респу́блика}}, ''Chechenskaya Respublika''; {{lang-ce|Нохчийн Республика}}, ''Noxçiyn Respublika''), or, informally, '''Chechnya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|tʃ|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-ru|Чечня́}}, ''Chechnya''; {{lang-ce|Нохчийчоь}}, ''Noxçiyçö''), sometimes referred to as '''[[Ichkeria (Chechnya)|Ichkeria]]''', '''Chechenistan''', '''Chechnia''', '''Chechenia''', or '''Noxçiyn''', is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[republic of Russia|republic]]). It is located in the southeastern part of [[Europe]] in the [[Northern Caucasus]] mountains. The Chechen Republic has a population of almost 1.3 million (2010) and its capital is [[Grozny]].

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] was split into two: the [[Republic of Ingushetia]] and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], which sought independence. Following the [[First Chechen War]] with Russia, Chechnya gained ''de facto'' independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian federal control was restored during the [[Second Chechen War]]. Since then there has been a systematic reconstruction and rebuilding process, though [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus|sporadic fighting]] continues in the mountains and southern regions of the republic.

See &quot;[[Chechen people]]&quot; for etymology of the name. In 2006 the former president, [[Alu Alkhanov]], proposed changing the official name of the republic to ''Noxçiyn'' (or ''Nokhchiin'') which is a [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of the name in the [[Chechen language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = BBC News | title = New name for Chechnya suggested | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5313594.stm | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | date=2006-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Chechnya}}

===Prehistory===
The oldest settlement found in the region goes back to 125,000 BC. In these mountain cave settlements, people lived who used tools, mastered fire, and used animal skin for warmth and other purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;chechhand&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jaimoukha|first=Amjad M.|title=The Chechens: a handbook|publisher=Routledge|date=2005-03-01|edition=1st|page=110|isbn=978-0415323284|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PnjAlei9fe0C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=Deela-Malkh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cBbztAi8mC&amp;sig=29XfftH681vf6iFbZRGDHzt0UYU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BliFSoDDKtOQtgf5tJSwCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Deela-Malkh&amp;f=false|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://amina.com/article/br_hist.html history of chechnya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces of human settlement that date back to 40,000&amp;nbsp;BC were found near [[Lake Kezanoi]]. Cave paintings, artifacts and other [[archaeological]] evidence indicate that there has been continuous habitation for some 8,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;chechhand&quot; /&gt;

===Early history===
In classical times, the northern slopes of the [[Caucasus]] mountains were inhabited by the [[Circassians]] on the west and the [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]] on the east. In between them, the [[Zygians]] occupied [[Zyx]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, the areas of north [[Ossetia]], the [[Balkar]], the [[Ingush]] and the Chechen republics today. Chechnya is a region in the Northern Caucasus which has been in almost constant battle against foreign rule since the 15th century. Eventually the Chechens converted to Sunni [[Islam]], largely encouraged by the motive of receiving help from the Ottoman Empire against Russian encroachment. &lt;ref&gt;Anciennes Croyances des Ingouches et des Tchétchènes.Mariel Tsaroïeva ISBN 2-7068-1792-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecha Ilyasov. ''The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present.'' ISBN 5-264-00693-0
&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian [[Terek Cossack Host]] was secretly established in Chechnya in 1577 by free Cossacks resettled from the [[Volga]] to the [[Terek River]].

===Caucasian Wars===
{{Main|Caucasian War}}

In 1783, Russia and the eastern Georgian kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] (which was devastated by Turkish and Persian invasions) signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], according to which Kartl-Kakheti received protection by Russia. In order to secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus mountains. The current resistance to Russian rule has its roots in the late 18th century (1785–1791), a period when Russia expanded into territories formerly under the dominion of [[Turkey]] and [[Persia]] (see also the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]]), under [[Mansur Ushurma]]—a Chechen [[Naqshbandi]] ([[Sufi]]) Sheikh—with wavering support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish a [[Transcaucasus]] Islamic state under [[shari'a]] law, but was unable to fully complete, because in the course of the war he was wounded and he was captured, where, for unknown reasons, he died. Its banner was again picked up by the [[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] [[Dagestani Imam Shamil]], who fought against the Russian from 1834 until 1859.

===Soviet rule===
[[File:Map of Mountain ASSR.png|thumb|left|300px|The [[Mountain ASSR]] and the districts established after the [[Russian Civil War]] (Chechnya is located on the far right)]]

Chechen rebellion would characteristically flare up whenever the Russian state faced a period of internal uncertainty. Rebellions occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Russian Civil War]] (see [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]), and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]]. Under Soviet rule, Chechnya was combined with [[Ingushetia]] to form the autonomous republic of [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingushetia]] in the late 1930s.

The Chechens again [[1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya|rose up against Soviet rule]] during the 1940s, resulting in the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportation]] of the entire [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|ethnic Chechen and Ingush populations]] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] (later [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Siberia]] in 1944 near the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Kavkazcenter.com| title=European Parliament recognizes deportation of Chechens as act of genocide| url=http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2004/02/26/2469.shtml| accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3509933.stm Remembering Stalin's deportations]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] and others argued this was punishment to the Chechens for providing assistance to the German forces. Although the German front never made it to the border of Chechnya, an active [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement threatened to undermine the Soviet defenses of the [[Caucasus]] (noted writer [[Valentin Pikul]] claims that while the city of Grozny was preparing for a siege in 1942, all of the air bombers stationed on the Caucasian front had to be re-directed towards quelling the Chechen insurrection instead of fighting Germans at the [[Battle of Stalingrad|siege of Stalingrad]]). Chechen-Ingushetia was abolished and the Chechens were allowed to return to their &quot;own ethnic land&quot; after 1956 during [[de-Stalinization]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]].

The [[Russification]] policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with [[Russian language]] proficiency required in many aspects of life and for advancement in the Soviet system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Recent events===
With the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, initially known as the ''Chechen National Congress'', was formed and led by ex-[[Soviet Air Force]] general and new Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] that rallied for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was ultimately opposed by [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s [[Russia|Russian Federation]], which first argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian States had—but was part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede; second, that other [[republics of Russia]], such as [[Tatarstan]], would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right; and third, that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of the Federation and hence its secession would hurt the country's economy and energy access.

In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally and forgoing the position held by the several successive Russian governments through the current administration. Various demographic factors including religious ones have continued to keep the area in a near constant state of war.

====First Chechen War====
{{Main|First Chechen War}}

The First Chechen War occurred in a two year period lasting from 1994 to 1996, when Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, which had already established independence since November 1991 (generally falling in line with other entities seceding from the USSR, except that Checheno-Ingushetia had previously been a division within Russia). Despite overwhelming manpower, weaponry and [[air support]], the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to many successful [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] raids. The [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]] in 1995 shocked the Russian public and discredited Chechen guerrillas. Widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of the Russian forces in the area and a successful offensive on Grozny by Chechen resistance forces led by [[Aslan Maskhadov]] prompted [[Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to declare a ceasefire in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.

====Inter-war period====
{{Main|Chechen Republic of Ichkeria}}

After the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new President Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and [[Prime Minister of Chechnya|prime minister]] in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing [[Moscow]] to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2003&amp;country=2593 Chechnya, reference article by Freedom House publications. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals. Most of these funds were taken by Chechen authorities and divided between favoured warlords.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron. [http://www.aei.org/outlook/15848 Chechnya, New Dimensions of the Old Crisis].  [[American Enterprise Institute|AEI]], 01.02.2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly half a million people (40% of Chechnya's prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in [[refugee camps]] or overcrowded villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissident&quot;&gt;[[Alexander Goldfarb (author)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko.

Two Russian brigades were permanently stationed in Chechnya.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissident&quot;/&gt;

In lieu of the devastated economic structure, kidnapping emerged as the principal source of income countrywide, procuring over $200 million during the three year independence of the chaotic fledgling state,&lt;ref&gt;Tishkov, Valery.

President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on October 25, 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing.  Bargishev's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on &quot;[[Wahhabism]]&quot;, was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a [[state of emergency]]. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.

====Second Chechen War====
{{Main|Second Chechen War}}

In August 1999, the [[Islamic International Brigade]] (IIPB) began an unsuccessful incursion into the neighbouring Russian republic of [[Dagestan]] in favor of the [[Shura of Dagestan]] who sought independence from Russia. (see [[Dagestan War]]). In September, a series of [[Russian apartment bombings|apartment bombings]] that killed three hundred Russian civilians took place in several Russian cities, including Moscow, which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen]] separatists. However, many journalists as well as a famous Russian dissident [[Alexander Litvinenko|Litvinenko]], later poisoned through the use of a highly radioactive material in London, point a finger at the Russian Secret Service for blowing up the houses to initiate a new military campaign against Chechnya. A famous Russian journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]] and Head of the Defense Council of Russian Duma (Parliament) were also killed after making similar claims. In response, after a prolonged air campaign of retaliatory strikes against the Ichkerian regime, a ground offensive began in October 1999 which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. Much better organized and planned than the first Chechen War, the military actions by the Russian Federal forces enabled them to re-establish control over most regions.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Chechnya}}

Since 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Today, Chechnya is a relatively stable [[federal republic]], although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on April 2, 2003 after an all-Chechen referendum was held on March 23, 2003. The independent observers alleged that the officially reported voter turnout seemed to be much higher than the reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = ISHR Germany | title = Some thoughts about the referendum in Chechnya | url = http://www.ishr.org/chechnya.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Chechens were controlled by regional [[teip]]s, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.
[[Image:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|thumb|300px|Chechnya and Caucasus map]]

===Regional government===
The former separatist religious leader (mufti) [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], looked upon as a traitor by many separatists, was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on October 5, 2003. Incidents of [[ballot stuffing]] and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) monitors. On May 9, 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a [[land mine|landmine]] explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and [[Sergey Abramov]] was appointed to the position of acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed a new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia referred to as the ''[[Kadyrovtsy]]''. The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].

In 2009, the American organization [[Freedom House]] included Chechnya in the &quot;Worst of the Worst&quot; list of most repressive societies in the world, together with [[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf Worst of the Worst: The World's Most Repressive Societies] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), ''[[Freedom House]]'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separatist government===
In addition to the Russian regional government, there was a separatist Ichkeria government that was not recognized by any state (although members have been given political asylum in European and Arab countries, as well as the United States).

Ichkeria is/was a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]. Former president of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the [[Georgian Civil War]], recognised the independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://pirweli.com.ge/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3399&amp;Itemid=45 in 1993, ex –President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia recognized Chechnya ` s independence..],&lt;/ref&gt; This recognition is no longer in effect.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognized [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] under the [[Taliban]] government on January 16, 2000. This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5597-11.cfm Are Chechens in Afghanistan?] --By Nabi Abdullaev, Dec 14, 2001 Moscow Times&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria- Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kullberg&quot;&gt;Kullberg, Anssi. &quot;The Background of Chechen Independence Movement III: The Secular Movement&quot;. ''The Eurasian politician''. 1 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Ichkeria also received vocal support from the Baltic countries, a group of Ukrainian nationalists and Poland; Estonia once voted to recognize, but the act never was followed through due to pressure applied by both Russia and the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kullberg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kari Takamaa and Martti Koskenneimi.

''Central Asian Survey'', Volume 14, Issue 4 1995, pages 553-572&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of this government was Aslan Maskhadov, the Foreign Minister was [[Ilyas Akhmadov]], who was the spokesman for Maskhadov. Aslan Maskhadov had been elected in an internationally monitored election in 1997 for 4 years, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001 he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election, since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offences in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the [[Second Chechen War]]. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on March 8, 2005, and the assassination of Maskhadov was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader to conduct peace talks with. [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Deputy Prime Minister and a Foreign Minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in [[England]]. He and others chose [[Abdul Khalim Saidullayev]], a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On June 17, 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in a Chechen town Argun. The successor of Saidullayev became [[Doku Umarov]]. On October 31, 2007 Umarov abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the [[Caucasian Emirate]] with himself as its [[Emir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf What is Hidden Behind the Idea of the Caucasian Emirate?]&lt;/ref&gt; This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.

==Human rights==
In 2006 [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that pro-Moscow Chechen forces under the command, in effect, of President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], as well as federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. &quot;If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture. And there is little chance that your torturer will be held accountable,&quot; said Holly Cartner, Director Europe and Central Asia division of HRW.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]]:[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/12/chechnya-research-shows-widespread-and-systematic-use-torture Chechnya: Research Shows Widespread and Systematic Use of Torture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups criticized the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections as unfairly influenced by the central Russian government and military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5028949 Chechnya Holds Parliamentary Vote], Morning Edition, NPR, November 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that after hundreds of thousands fled their homes following inter-ethnic and separatist conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&amp;count=10000 Government efforts help only some IDPs rebuild their lives], IDMC, August 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1997, Criminal Code reportedly being implemented in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya, Article 148 punishes &quot;anal sexual intercourse between a man and a woman or a man and a man&quot;). For first- and second-time offenders, the punishment is caning. A third conviction leads to the death penalty, which can be carried out in a number of ways including stoning or beheading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]]:[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR040091997?open&amp;of=ENG-AZE  Amnesty International working against laws punishing sexual relations between men], 1 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2009, the New York Times released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government. The accusations were sparked by the assassination in Austria of a former Chechen rebel who had gained access to Kadyrov's inner circle, 27-year old Umar Israilov.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]]:[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/world/europe/01torture.html Slain Exile Detailed Chechen Ruler's Systematic Cruelty], February 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2009, [[Amnesty International]] released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the [[Russian Federation]] against Chechnyan citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable. This led to the conclusion that Chechnya was being ruled without law, being run into further devastating destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]]:[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR46/012/2009/en/66cda198-85c0-452c-a2c5-98cac593a990/eur460122009en.pdfl Russian Federation Rule Without Law: Human Rights violations in the North Caucasus], July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Chechnya}}

==Demographics==
{{Main|Chechen people}}

According to the Russian official estimates, the population of Chechnya as at 1 January 2010 is 1,267,740. As per 2002 [[Russian Census (2002)|Census]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]] at&amp;nbsp;1,031,647 make up 93.5% of the republic's population. Other groups include [[Russians]] (40,645, or 3.7%), [[Kumyks]] (8,883, or 0.8%), [[Ingush]] (2,914 or 0.3%) and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population. Birth rate was 25.41 in 2004. (25.7 in Achkhoi Martan, 19.8 in Groznyy, 17.5 in Kurchaloi, 28.3 in Urus Martan and 11.1 in Vedeno). According to the Chechen State Statistical Committee, Chechnya's population had grown to 1.205 million in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KHII-7BR2LM?OpenDocument Chechnya - The week in brief: 4 - Feb 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Soviet era, ethnic Russians (including Cossacks) comprised about 23% of the population (269,000 in 1989).
According to Russia, from 1991 to 1994 tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity left the [[republic]] amidst reports of violence and discrimination against the non-Chechen population (mostly Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians), which some Russian sources will call &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O.P. Orlov|coauthors=V.P. Cherkassov|url=http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/chechen/itogi/preface.htm#_VPID_2|title=Россия — Чечня: Цепь ошибок и преступлений|publisher=[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia and pro-Russian sources claim that due to widespread lawlessness and ethnic cleansing under the government of [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] most non-Chechens fled the country during the 1990s or were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolov-Mitrich, Dmitryi. [http://www.izvestia.ru/russia/article1092129 &quot;Забытый геноцид&quot;]. Izvestia. Retrieved on July 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, regarding this exodus, there are opposing views. The mass depopulation of Russians in ethnic republics occurred throughout virtually the whole Soviet Union (and prior to the two wars, the phenomenon in Chechnya was not uniquely high), and is not distinct for Chechnya/Ichkeria in any way. According to economists Boris Lvin and Andrei Iliaronov,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Chechen authorities are regularly accused of crimes against the population, especially the Russian-speaking people. However, before the current war the emigration of the Russian-speaking population from Chechnya was no more intense than that from Kalmykia, Tuva and Sakha-Yakutia. In Grozny itself there remained a 200,000 strong Russian-speaking population which did not hasten to leave it.&lt;ref&gt;Written by economists Boris Lvin and [[Andrei Illarionov]]. ''Moscow News''. Feb 24- March 2, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: This source is written in 1995; it should be noted that in the modern day, however, the Russian population is far less than 200000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view of the ethnic situation in Ichkeria, provided by notably even Russian sources, the real end of the presence of Russians occurred during the First Chechen War, when Grozny (where 4 out of 5 Russians in the Republic of Chechnya lived, mainly as oil workers{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}) was bombed extensively by [[Russian Federation]]. Other reasons for leaving may have been economic: the economy of Chechnya was always horrible, and was plummeting even further starting in the Gorbachev era and continuing through the two wars.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The languages used in the Republic are [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Chechen belongs to the Vaynakh or [[North-central Caucasian languages|North-central Caucasian]] language family, which also includes [[Ingush language|Ingush]] and [[Batsb language|Batsb]]. Some scholars place it in a wider [[Iberian-Caucasian languages|Iberian-Caucasian super-family]].

Chechnya has one of the youngest populations in the generally ageing Russian Federation; in the early 1990s, it was among the few regions experiencing natural population growth. Since 2002, Chechnya has experienced a classic post-conflict baby-boom.&lt;ref name=Fuller&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Preliminary_Chechen_Census_Findings_Unveiled/2209723.html |title=Preliminary Chechen Census Findings Unveiled |author= Liz Fuller |date=3 November 2010 |work= |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chechen demographers in 2008 termed highly implausible the reported overall population growth as infant mortality in Chechnya was said to be 60 percent higher than the Russian average in 2007 and to have risen by 3.9 percent compared with 2006.&lt;ref name=Fuller/&gt; Many experts have expressed doubts about the increase from 1.1 million in the 1990 to an estimated nearly 1.3 million in 2010 following two devastating wars that displaced hundreds of thousands people and virtually eliminated the large ethnic Russian minority in the republic.&lt;ref name=Dzutsev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzutsev |first1=Valery |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |title=2010 Census Data is Adjusted to Meet Kremlin Priorities in the North Caucasus |journal= |volume=7 |issue=207 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37171 |accessdate= 12 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian demographer Dmitry Bogoyavlensky, the 2002 census results were clearly manipulated in the North Caucasus: an estimated 800,000 to 1 million non-existent people were added to the actual population of the region.&lt;ref name=Dzutsev/&gt; Another Russian demographer, Anatoly Vishnevsky, pointed out that according to the 2002 census, some age groups, like those born in 1950, appeared to be larger in 2002 than in 1989.&lt;ref name=Dzutsev/&gt; With the 2002 census, Moscow wanted to show there were not too many casualties and that the refugees had returned to Chechnya, while the local authorities wanted to receive more funds and thus needed a higher population to justify their demands.&lt;ref name=Dzutsev/&gt; Also, in the multiethnic republics of North Caucasus normally unlike in other parts of Russia, government positions are distributed among the ethnicities according to their ratio in the general population.&lt;ref name=Dzutsev/&gt; So ethnicities are zealously guarding their numbers in order not to be outnumbered by others and thereby left with less representation in the government and the local economy.&lt;ref name=Dzutsev/&gt; Some 40 percent of newborns had some kind of genetic defect.&lt;ref name=Fuller/&gt;

===Religion===
Islam is the traditional Religion in Chechnya. 94 % of the Chechens are [[Sunnite|Sunni]] [[Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/ponars/pm_0388.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the country having converted to Islam between the 16th and the 19th centuries. Most of the population follows either the [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanafi]], or [[Maliki]] schools of jurisprudence, [[fiqh]]. The Shafi'i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue4/jv9no4a4.html] Chechnya, Wahhabism and the invasion of Dagestan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kavkazcenter.com/russ/islam/jihad_in_ncaucasus/chap3.shtml] Djihad in the Northern Caucus Ch3&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it remains the most practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2372572 |title=The Kremlin's War on Islamic Education in the North Caucasus |author=Mairbek Vatchagaev |date=September 8, 2006  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011204749/http://jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2372572 |archivedate=2007-10-11}} Chechnya Weekly, Volume 7, Issue 34 (September 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The once-strong Russian minority in Chechnya, mostly [[Terek Cossacks]], are predominately [[Russian Orthodox]], although presently only one church exists in Grozny. The [[Armenians|Armenian]] community, which used to number around 20,000 in Grozny alone, has dwindled to a couple of families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ishkhanyan, Vahan, ArmeniaNow.com | title = The case for Chechnya | url=http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=2638 | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
During the war, the Chechen economy fell apart. [[Gross domestic product]], if reliably calculable, would be only a fraction of the prewar level. Problems with the Chechen economy had an effect on the federal Russian economy—a number of financial crimes during the 1990s were committed using Chechen financial organizations. Chechnya has the highest ratio within Russian Federation of financial operations made in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] to operations in [[Russian ruble]]s. There are many [[counterfeit]] U.S. dollars printed there. In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but that did not happen due to Russian troops re-taking Chechnya in the [[Second Chechen War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  As an effect of the war, approximately 80% of the economic potential of Chechnya was destroyed. Much of the money spent by the Russian federal government to rebuild Chechnya has been wasted.  According to the Russian government, over $2 billion was spent on the reconstruction of the Chechen economy since 2000. However, according to the Russian central economic control agency (''Schyotnaya Palata''), not more than $350 million was spent as intended.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  That being said, the economic situation in Chechnya has improved considerably since 2000. According to the ''New York Times'', major efforts to rebuild Grozny have been made, and improvements in the political situation have led some officials to consider setting up a tourism industry, though there are claims that construction workers are being irregularly paid and that poor people have been displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/world/europe/30grozny.html | work=The New York Times | title=Chechnya's Capital Rises From the Ashes, Atop Hidden Horrors | first=Andrew E. | last=Kramer | date=April 30, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See the main article [[Grozny#Today|Grozny]].

[[Image:stcyprian.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[St. Cyprian of Carthage]], who urged diligence in the process of canonization.]]   

'''Canonization''' (or '''canonisation''') is the act by which a [[Christianity|Christian]] church declares a deceased person to be a [[saint]], upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, individuals were recognized as saints without any formal process. The process is most commonly used in, although not limited to, the [[Catholic Church]].

Canonization, whether formal or informal, does not ''make'' someone a saint: it is only a declaration that the person ''is'' a saint and ''was'' a saint even before canonization.

==Historical development of the process==
{{Main|Historical process of beatification and canonization}}
The first persons whom the Christian Church honored as saints were the [[martyr]]s. Pious legends of their deaths were considered to affirm the truth of their faith in Christ, and formalization and celebration of these legends served to legitimize and propagate the doctrines of the Church and serve as examples.

The [[Latin Rite]] Canon of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] contains the names only of martyrs, along with that of  the [[Virgin Mary]] and, since 1962, that of [[Saint Joseph]].

By the fourth century, however, &quot;[[confessor]]s&quot; — people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life — began to be venerated publicly. Examples of such people are Saint [[Hilarion]] and Saint [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in the East, and Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] in the West. Their names were inserted in the [[diptych]]s, the lists of saints explicitly venerated in the [[liturgy]], and their tombs were honoured like those of the martyrs. Since the witness of their lives was not as unequivocal as that of the martyrs, they were venerated publicly only with the approval by the local [[bishop]]. 

This approval was required even for veneration of a reputed martyr. In his history of the [[Donatism|Donatist]] [[heresy]], [[Saint Optatus]] recounts that at [[Carthage]] a Catholic matron, named Lucilla, incurred the censures of the Church for having kissed the [[relic]]s of a reputed martyr whose claims to martyrdom had not been juridically proved. And Saint [[Cyprian]] (died 258) recommended that the utmost diligence be observed in investigating the claims of those who were said to have died for the faith. All the circumstances accompanying the martyrdom were to be inquired into; the faith of those who suffered, and the motives that animated them were to be rigorously examined, in order to prevent the recognition of undeserving persons. Evidence was sought from the court records of the trials or from people who had been present at the trials.

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] (died 430) tells of the procedure which obtained in his day for the recognition of a martyr. The bishop of the diocese in which the martyrdom took place set up a canonical process for conducting the inquiry with the utmost severity.  The acts of the process were sent either to the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] or [[Primate (religion)|primate]], who carefully examined the cause, and, after consultation with the [[suffragan]] bishops, declared whether the defunct was worthy of the name of 'martyr' and public veneration. 

Acts of formal recognition, such as the erection of an [[altar]] over the saint's tomb or transferring the saint's relics to a church, were preceded by formal inquiries into the sanctity of the person's life and the miracles attributed to that person's intercession.

Such acts of recognition of a saint  were authoritative, in the strict sense, only for the [[diocese]] or [[ecclesiastical province]] for which they were issued, but with the spread of the fame of a saint, were often accepted elsewhere also.

==Catholic Church==
In the [[Catholic Church]] (both the [[Latin Catholic Church|Western]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Churches]]) the act of canonization is reserved to the [[Holy See]] and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the person proposed for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he or she is worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the persons are now in heavenly glory, that they may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the [[liturgy]] of the Church, most especially in the [[Litany of the Saints]].  Other Catholic churches still follow the older practice (see, for instance, [[Canonization#Eastern Orthodox Practice—Glorification|below]] on the practice of the Orthodox Church).

In the Catholic Church, canonization involves a decree that allows veneration of the saint in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Rite]] throughout the world. For permission to venerate on a local level, only [[beatification]] is needed, not canonization.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept&quot; ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Beccari, Camillo. &quot;Beatification and Canonization&quot;] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Retrieved 27 May 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval procedure===
In the Medieval West, the [[Holy See]] began to be asked to intervene in the question of canonizations, so as to ensure a more authoritative decision. The canonization of [[Saint Udalric, Bishop of Augsburg]], by [[Pope John XV]] in 993 is the first undoubted example of a papal canonization of a saint from outside Rome. (Some historians maintain that the first such canonization was that of Saint Swibert by [[Pope Leo III]] in 804.) Thereafter recourse was had with greater frequency to the judgment of the popes.  [[Walter of Pontoise]] was canonized by [[Hugh de Boves]], the [[Archbishop of Rouen]] in [[1153]]; Walter was the last saint in [[Western Europe]] to have been canonized by an authority other than the pope.&lt;ref name = &quot;ofsnlu&quot;&gt;William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'' (Murray, 1875), 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saint-mike.org/library/papal_library/AlexanderIII/biography.html Alexander III]&lt;/ref&gt; “The last case of canonization by a metropolitan is said to have been that of St. Gaultier, or Gaucher, abbot of Pontoise, by the Archbishop of Rouen.  A decree of [[Pope Alexander III]], 1170, gave the prerogative to the pope thenceforth, so far as the Western Church was concerned.”&lt;ref name = &quot;ofsnlu&quot;/&gt;

In 1173 [[Pope Alexander III]], after reprimanding certain bishops for having permitted veneration of a man who was far from being a saint, decreed: &quot;You shall not therefore presume to honour him in the future; for, even if miracles were worked through him, it is not lawful for you to venerate him as a saint without the authority of the Catholic Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory IX, ''Decretales'', III, &quot;De reliquiis et veneratione sanctorum&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure initiated by the text of Alexander III, confirmed by a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Innocent III]] in the year 1200, issued on the occasion of the canonization of Saint Cunegunde, led to increasingly elaborate inquiries.

===Roman Catholic procedure since 1983===
{{Main|Congregation for the Causes of Saints}}
[[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul II's]] [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Divinus Perfectionis Magister]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_divinus-perfectionis-magister_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; of 25 January 1983, and the norms issued by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] on 7 February 1983, for its implementation on diocesan level continued the work of simplification already initiated by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_divinus-perfectionis-magister_en.html Divinus Perfectionis Magister]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the reforms eliminated the office of  the Promoter of the Faith (Latin: promotor fidei), popularly known as the [[Devil's advocate]], who was required to present a case against canonization. Possibly as a result, the rate of canonization increased markedly after 1983.

'''&quot;Servant of God&quot;''' The process leading towards canonization begins at the diocesan level. A [[bishop]] with jurisdiction—usually the bishop of the place where the candidate died or is buried, although another ordinary can be given this authority—gives permission to open an investigation into the virtues of the individual, responding to a petition by members of the faithful, either actually or [[pro forma]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]], 1983, [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_divinus-perfectionis-magister_en.html ''Divinus Perfectionis Magister''], Art I, Sec 1&lt;/ref&gt; This investigation may open no sooner than five years after the death of the person being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Pietro Cardinal Palazzini, 1983, [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_07021983_norme_en.html ''Norms to be observed in inquiries made by bishops in the causes of saints''], § 9 a&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pope has the authority to waive this five year waiting period, as was done for [[Mother Teresa]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html '' Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1910-1997), biography''], Office of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, Internet Office of the Holy See&lt;/ref&gt;, and for [[Lúcia Santos]] and for John Paul II himself by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-21764?l=english]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[José Saraiva Martins]], [[Claretians|C.M.F.]]; 2005; [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html ''Response of His Holiness Benedict XVI for the examination of the cause for beatification and canonization of the Servant of God John Paul II'']&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, a guild or organization to promote the cause of the candidate's sainthood is created, an exhaustive search of the candidate's writings, speeches and sermons is undertaken, a detailed biography is written and eyewitness accounts are gathered. When sufficient information has been gathered, the investigation of the candidate, who is called '''&quot;Servant of God&quot;''', is presented by the local bishop to the [[Roman Curia]]&amp;mdash;the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints&amp;mdash;where it is assigned a [[postulator]], whose task is to gather further information about the life of the Servant of God. Religious orders who regularly deal with the congregation often have their own designated postulator generals.

'''&quot;Declaration 'Non Cultus'&quot;''' At some point, permission is then granted for the body of the Servant of God to be exhumed and examined, a certification (&quot;non cultus&quot;)  is made that no superstitious or heretical worship or improper cult has grown up around the servant or his or her tomb, and relics are taken. 

'''&quot;Venerable/Heroic in Virtue&quot;''' When enough information has been gathered, the congregation will recommend to the [[pope]] that he make a proclamation of the Servant of God's [[heroic virtue]] (that is, that the servant exhibited the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, and the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, to a heroic degree). From this point the one said to be &quot;heroic in virtue&quot; is referred to by the title '''&quot;[[Venerable]]&quot;'''. A Venerable has as of yet no [[feast day]], no churches may be built in his or her honor, and the church has made no statement on the person's probable or certain presence in heaven, but [[prayer card]]s and other materials may be printed to encourage the faithful to pray for a [[miracle]] wrought by his or her intercession as a sign of God's will that the person be canonized.

'''&quot;Blessed&quot;''' Beatification is a statement by the church that it is &quot;worthy of belief&quot; that the person is in heaven, having come to salvation. This step depends on whether the Venerable is a [[martyr]] or a &quot;confessor&quot;. 

* For a martyr, the Pope has only to make a declaration of martyrdom, a certification that the venerable gave his or her life voluntarily as a witness for the faith and/or in an act of heroic charity for others.

* If the Venerable was not a martyr – all non-martyrs are &quot;confessors&quot; as they &quot;confessed&quot; or bore witness to their faith by how they lived their lives – it must be proven that a [[miracle]] has taken place by his or her intercession: that is, that God has shown a sign that the person is enjoying the Beatific Vision by God performing a miracle in response to the Blessed's prayers.  Today, these miracles are almost always miraculous cures, as these are the easiest to establish based on the Catholic Church's requirements for a &quot;miracle.&quot; (The patient was sick, there was no known cure for the ailment, prayers were directed to the Venerable, the patient was cured, the cure was spontaneous, instantaneous, complete and lasting, and doctors cannot find any natural explanation.)

This allows [[beatification]], giving the venerable the new title '''&quot;Blessed&quot;''' (abbreviated &quot;Bl.&quot;) or, in Latin, Beatus or Beata. A feast day will be designated, but its observance is normally restricted to the Blessed's home diocese, to certain locations associated with him or her, and/or to the churches or houses of the blessed's religious order, if they belonged to one. Parishes may not normally be named in honor of a Blessed.

'''&quot;Saint&quot;''' (contracted &quot;St&quot; or &quot;S.&quot;) To be canonized a saint, at least two miracles must have been performed after death. Canonization is a statement by the church that the person certainly enjoys the [[Beatific Vision]]. The saint is assigned a feast day which ''may'' be celebrated anywhere within the Catholic Church, although it may or may not appear on the general calendar or local calendars as an ''obligatory'' feast, parish churches may be built in his or her honor, and the faithful may freely and without restriction celebrate and honor the saint.

In the case of persons that common usage has called saints from &quot;time immemorial&quot; (in practice, since before 1500 or so), the Church may carry out a &quot;confirmation of [[cultus]]&quot;, which is much simpler. For example, Saint [[Hermann Joseph]] had his veneration confirmed by [[Pope Pius XII]].

In the case of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], individual churches ''sui juris'' retain, in theory, the right to glorify (see next section on Eastern Orthodox practice) saints for their own jurisdictions, though this has rarely happened in practice.

Although a recognition of sainthood by the Pope does not directly concern a fact of divine revelation, it must still be &quot;definitively held&quot; by the faithful as infallible under (at the very least) the [[Infallibility of the Church|Universal Magisterium of the Church]] since it is a truth connected to revelation by historical necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFADTU.HTM Doctrinal Commentary on the Concluding Formula of the ''Professio Fidei''], by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm &quot;Beatification and Canonization&quot;], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox==
{{Main|Glorification#In Orthodox Christianity}}

The [[glorification]] of saints in the [[Orthodox Church]] differs from Roman Catholic tradition in practice. The official recognition of saints grows from the [[consensus]] of the church.

It is believed that when an individual who has been sanctified by the grace of the [[Holy Spirit]] &quot;falls asleep in the Lord&quot;, God may or may not choose to glorify the individual through the manifestation of [[miracle]]s. If so, the devotion to the saint will normally grow from the &quot;grass roots&quot; level. 
Eventually, miracles will have grown to such a degree that a formal Service of Glorification will be scheduled. A glorification may be performed by any [[bishop]] within his [[diocese]].  Often there will be a formal investigation to be sure that the individual is Orthodox in their faith, has led a life worthy of emulation, and that the reports of miracles attributed to their intercessions are verifiable. The glorification service does not &quot;make&quot; the individual a saint; rather, the Church is simply making a formal acknowledgement of what God has already manifested. 

[[Martyr]]s need no formal glorification; the witness of their self-sacrifice is considered sufficient.

[[Timothy Ware]] (Bishop Kallistos of Diokleia) has written about canonization in Orthodoxy: &quot;In private an Orthodox Christian is free to ask for the prayers of any member of the Church, whether canonized or not. It would be perfectly normal for an Orthodox child, if orphaned, to end his evening prayers by asking for the intercession not only of the Mother of God and the saints, but of his own mother and father. In its public worship, however, the Church usually asks the prayers only of those whom it has officially proclaimed as saints; but in exceptional circumstances a public cult may become established without any formal act of canonization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Ware ''The Orthodox Church'' (Oxford: Penguin Book, 1993), 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarely, the Orthodox Church adopts a Roman Catholic saint who was canonized after the [[East–West_Schism|Great Schism of 1054]], as it did Hungary's King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] in 2000, who had been previously canonized by [[Pope Gregory VII]] in 1083.

==Anglicanism==
Since the [[English Reformation]], only [[Charles I of England|Saint Charles Stuart]] has been canonized in the [[Church of England]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].  National [[Anglican]] churches have their own [[calendar of saints|calendars]] of saints and other holy men and women. Some more recent people, while not officially declared saints, have been added to certain [[List of Anglican Church Calendars|Anglican national calendars]] for commemoration; for example, [[C. S. Lewis]] (November 22) and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (April 4).

Independant and [[Continuing Anglican]] churches also have their own calendars of saints. The [[African Orthodox Church]], and independant African-American Anglican denomination, is well known for having canonized [[St. John Coltrane]]. Since then the [[Episcopal Church USA|Episcopal Church]] has also added him to their list of &quot;historic black saints&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-06-16/music/17722625_1_saint-john-coltrane-patron-saint-black-jesus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran practice==
{{further|[[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)]] and [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)]]}}
As stated in the [[Augsburg Confession]] article 21 (1530), [[Lutherans]], while including many traditional saints days on their [[lectionary]] and respecting them as examples of faith, do not accept the concept of canonization or the Roman Catholic concept of sainthood. However, the Lutheran church does celebrate saints with different feast days according to their [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]].

'''Carboxylic acids''' ({{IPA-en|ˌkɑrbɒkˈsɪlɪk ...|pron}}) are [[organic acid]]s characterized by the presence of at least one carboxyl group.&lt;ref&gt;[[Compendium of Chemical Terminology]], [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C00852.html carboxylic acids], accessed 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The general formula of a carboxylic acid is R-COOH, where R is some [[valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[functional group]].  A '''carboxyl group''' (or '''carboxy''') is a [[functional group]] consisting of a [[carbonyl]] (RR'C=O) and a [[hydroxyl]] (R-O-H), which has the [[Chemical formula|formula]] -C(=O)OH, usually written as -COOH or -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H.&lt;ref&gt;March, J. “Advanced Organic Chemistry” 4th Ed.  J. Wiley and Sons, 1992: New York.  ISBN 0-471-60180-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carboxylic acids are [[Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory|Brønsted-Lowry acids]], they are proton donors. They are the most common type of [[organic acid]]. Among the simplest examples are [[formic acid]] H-COOH, that occurs in [[ant]]s, and [[acetic acid]] [[methyl|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]-COOH, that gives [[vinegar]] its sour taste. Acids with two or more carboxyl groups are called '''dicarboxylic''', '''tricarboxylic''', etc. The simplest dicarboxylic example is [[oxalic acid]] (COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is just two connected carboxyls. [[Mellitic acid]] is an example of a hexacarboxylic acid. Other important natural examples are [[citric acid]] (in [[lemon]]s) and [[tartaric acid]] (in [[tamarind]]s).

[[Salt (chemistry)|Salts]] and [[ester]]s of carboxylic acids are called [[carboxylate]]s. When a carboxyl group is [[deprotonate]]d, its [[conjugate base]], a carboxylate anion is formed. Carboxylate ions are [[resonance stabilized]] and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than [[alcohol]]s. Carboxylic acids can be seen as reduced or alkylated forms of the [[Lewis acid]] [[carbon dioxide]]; under some circumstances they can be [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] to yield carbon dioxide.

==Physical properties==
===Solubility===
[[Image:Carboxylic acid dimers.png|thumb|right|Carboxylic acid [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s]]
Carboxylic acids are [[polarity (chemistry)|polar]].  Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl), they also participate in [[hydrogen bond]]ing. Together the hydroxyl and carbonyl group forms the functional group carboxyl.  Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimeric pairs in nonpolar media due to their tendency to “self-associate.” Smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble with water, whereas higher carboxylic acids are less soluble due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain.  These longer chain acids tend to be rather soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols.&lt;ref name=M&amp;B&gt;R.T. Morrison, R.N. Boyd. ''Organic Chemistry'', 6th Ed. (1992) ISBN 0-13-643669-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boiling points===
Carboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, not only because of their increased surface area, but because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers. Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken, or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase [[enthalpy of vaporisation]] requirements significantly.

===Acidity===
Carboxylic acids are typically [[weak acid]]s, meaning that they only partially [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[cation]]s and RCOO&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt; [[anion]]s in neutral [[Water (molecule)|aqueous]] solution.  For example, at room temperature, only 0.4% of all [[acetic acid]] molecules are dissociated.  Electronegative substituents give stronger acids.

|}
[[Deprotonation]] of a carboxylic acid gives a carboxylate anion, which is [[resonance stabilized]] because the negative charge is shared (delocalized) between the two oxygen atoms increasing its stability. Each of the carbon-oxygen bonds in a carboxylate anion has partial double-bond character.

===Odor===
Carboxylic acids often have strong odors, especially the volatile derivatives.  Most common are acetic acid (vinegar) and butyric acid (rancid butter).  On the other hand, esters of carboxylic acids tend to have pleasant odors and many are used in [[perfume]]s.

==Characterization==
Carboxylic acids are most readily identified as such by [[infrared spectroscopy]]. They exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the C-O vibration bond (ν&lt;sub&gt;C=O&lt;/sub&gt;) between 1680 and 1725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  A characteristic ν&lt;sub&gt;O-H&lt;/sub&gt; band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; region.&lt;ref name=M&amp;B/&gt;  By &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrometry, the [[hydroxyl]] hydrogen appears in the 10-13 ppm region, although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.

==Occurrence and applications==
Many carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale.  They are also pervasive in nature.  Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins.

Carboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives.  Industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), [[acrylic acid|acrylic and methacrylic acids]] (precursors to polymers, adhesives), adipic acid (polymers), citric acid (beverages), [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (chelating agent), fatty acids (coatings), [[maleic acid]] (polymers), propionic acid (food preservative), [[terephthalic acid]] (polymers).

==Synthesis==
===Industrial routes===
Industrial routes to carboxylic acids generally differ from those used on smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.
*Oxidation of aldehydes with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts.  The required [[aldehyde]]s are readily obtained from alkenes by [[hydroformylation]].
*Oxidation of hydrocarbons using air.  For simple alkanes, the method is nonselective but so inexpensive to be useful.  Allylic and benzylic compounds undergo more selective oxidations. Alkyl groups on a benzene ring oxidized to the carboxylic acid, regardless of its chain length. [[Benzoic acid]] from [[toluene]] and [[terephthalic acid]] from para-[[xylene]], and [[phthalic acid]] from ortho-[[xylene]] are illustrative large-scale conversions.  [[Acrylic acid]] is generated from propene.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Riemenschneider “Carboxylic Acids, Aliphatic” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a05_235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols.
*Carbonylation is versatile method when coupled to the addition of water.  This method is effective for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary [[carbocation]]s, e.g. [[isobutylene]] to [[pivalic acid]]. In the [[Koch reaction]], the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong acids.  Acetic acid and formic acid are produced by the [[carbonylation]] of methanol, conducted with [[iodide]] and alkoxide promoters, respectively and often with high pressures of carbon monoxide, usually involving additional hydrolytic steps.  Hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and CO.  Such reactions are sometimes called &quot;[[Walter Reppe|Reppe chemistry]]&quot;:
:HCCH  +  CO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H

*Some long chain carboxylic acids are obtained by the hydrolysis of [[triglyceride]]s obtained from plant or animal oils.  These methods are related to [[soap making]].
*[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of ethanol is used in the production of [[vinegar]].

===Laboratory methods===
Preparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.
*[[Oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids|oxidation of primary alcohols]] or  [[aldehyde]]s with strong [[oxidants]] such as [[potassium dichromate]], [[Jones reagent]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[sodium chlorite]].  The method is amenable to laboratory conditions compared to the industrial use of air, which is “greener” since it yields less inorganic side products such as chromium or manganese oxides.
* Oxidative cleavage of [[olefin]]s by [[ozonolysis]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[potassium dichromate]].
*Carboxylic acids can also be obtained by the hydrolysis of [[nitrile]]s, [[ester]]s, or [[amide]]s, generally with acid- or base-catalysis.
*Carbonation of a [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]] and [[organolithium]] reagents:
:RLi  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li
:RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li  +  HCl   RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  LiCl
* Halogenation followed by hydrolysis of methyl ketones in the [[haloform reaction]]
*The [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] provides a route to [[salicylic acid]], precursor to [[aspirin]].

===Less-common reactions===
Many reactions afford carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or are mainly of academic interest:
* Disproportionation of an [[aldehyde]] in the [[Cannizzaro reaction]]
* Rearrangement of diketones in the [[benzilic acid rearrangement]] involving the generation of benzoic acids are the [[von Richter reaction]] from nitrobenzenes and the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] from [[phenol]]s.

==Reactions==
The most widely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters, amides, carboxylate salts, acid chlorides, and alcohols.  Carboxylic acids react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced with a metal [[cation]]. Thus, acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) to form sodium acetate, [[carbon dioxide]], and water:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Carboxylic acids also react with [[alcohol]]s to give [[ester]]s.  This process is heavily used in the production of [[polyesters]]. Similarly carboxylic acids are converted into [[amide]]s, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine.  Instead esters are typical precursors to amides.  The conversion of [[amino acid]]s into [[peptide]]s is a major biochemical process that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

The hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using [[thionyl chloride]] to give [[acyl chloride]]s.  In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to [[thioester]]s.

Carboxylic acid can be [[carboxylic acid reduction|reduced]] to the alcohol by [[hydrogenation]] or using stoichiometric hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]]. 

N,N-dimethylchloromethylenammonium chloride is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activate the carboxylic acid and is known to tolerate active functionalities such as ketone as well as the moderate ester, olefin, nitrile and halide moeties.&lt;ref&gt;Tamotsu Fujisawa and Toshio Sato, Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 8, p.498 (1993); Vol. 66, p.121 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Barbier-Wieland degradation}}
===Specialized reactions===
*As with all carbonyl compounds, the protons on the [[alpha-carbon|α-carbon]] are labile due to keto-enol tautomerization. Thus the α-carbon is easily halogenated in the [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation]].
*The [[Schmidt reaction]] converts carboxylic acids to [[amine]]s.
*Carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the [[Hunsdiecker reaction]].
* The [[Dakin-West reaction]] converts an amino acid to the corresponding amino ketone.
* In the '''Barbier-Wieland degradation''', the alpha-methylene group in an aliphatic carboxylic acid is removed in a sequence of reaction steps, effectively a chain-shortening.&lt;ref&gt;[[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 3, p.234 (1955); Vol. 24, p.38 (1944) [http://www.orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV3P0234.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 3, p.237 (1955); Vol. 24, p.41 (1944) [http://www.orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV3P0237.pdf Link].&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse procedure is the [[Arndt-Eistert synthesis]], where an acid is converted into acyl halide and reacts with [[diazomethane]] to give the highest homolog. 
* Many acids undergo decarboxylation. [[Enzyme]]s that catalyze these reactions are known as [[carboxylase]]s ([[EC number|EC]] 6.4.1) and [[decarboxylase]]s (EC 4.1.1).
* Carboxylic acids are reduced to [[aldehydes]] via the [[ester]] and [[Diisobutylaluminium hydride|DIBAL]], via the acid chloride in the [[Rosenmund reduction]] and via the thioester in the [[Fukuyama reduction]].

==Nomenclature and examples==
Carboxylic acids are commonly named as indicated in the table below.  Although rarely used, [[IUPAC]]-recommended names also exist.  For example, [[butyric acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) is, according to IUPAC guidelines, also known as butanoic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-4 Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives. http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_24.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carboxylate|carboxylate anion]] R-COO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is usually named with the suffix ''-ate'', so acetic acid, for example, becomes acetate ion.  In [[IUPAC nomenclature]], carboxylic acids have an ''-oic acid'' suffix (e.g., octadecanoic acid).  In [[common nomenclature]], the suffix is usually ''-ic acid'' (e.g., [[stearic acid]]).

'''Chernobyl''' or '''Chornobyl''' ({{lang-uk|Чорнобиль}}, {{IPA-uk|tʃɔrˈnɔbɪlʲ|pron}}), ({{IPA-en|tʃərˈnoʊbɨl}}; {{lang-ru|Чернобыль}}, {{IPA-ru|tɕɪrˈnobɨlʲ|pron}}) is an [[Ghost town|abandoned city]] in northern [[Ukraine]], in [[Kiev Oblast]], near the border with [[Belarus]]. The city had been the administrative centre of the Chernobyl [[Raion]] since 1932.

The city was evacuated in 1986 due to the [[Chernobyl disaster]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], located 14.5 kilometres (9 miles) north-northwest. The power plant was within Chernobyl [[Raion]] (District), but the city was not the residence of the power plant workers. When the power plant was under construction, [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]], a city larger and closer to the power plant, had been built as home for the power plant workers. After the accident the Chernobyl Raion administration was transferred to the neighboring [[Kiev Raion]].

Though the city today is mostly uninhabited, a small number of people reside in houses marked with signs stating that the &quot;Owner of this house lives here&quot;. Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone|Zone of Alienation]] are stationed in the city on a long term basis. Prior to its evacuation, the city was inhabited by about 14,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mould|first=Richard  |title=Chernobyl Record|publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]|location=Bristol, England|page=105|chapter=Evacuation zones and populations|isbn=0-7503-0670-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Slavutych]] was built specifically for the evacuated population of Chernobyl.

==Name origin==
The city is named after the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] word for [[Artemisia vulgaris|mugwort]] or wormwood (''Artemisia vulgaris''), which is чорнобиль &quot;chornobyl&quot;. An alternative etymology holds that it is a combination of the words ''chornyi'' (чорний, black) and ''byllia'' (билля, grass blades or stalks), hence it would literally mean black grass or black stalks.

==History==
Chernobyl first appeared in a charter of 1193, described as a hunting-lodge of [[Knyaz]] [[Rostislavich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[Europe: A History]]'', Oxford University Press, 1996, ISBN 0198201710&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chornobyl.in.ua/en/chornobyl.htm Chernobyl ancient history and maps].&lt;/ref&gt; It was a crown village of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 13th century. The village was granted as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Filon Kmita]], a captain of the royal [[cavalry]], in 1566. The province containing Chernobyl was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1569, and then annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND2&quot;&gt;Davies, Norman (1995) &quot;Chernobyl&quot;, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/195/index.html ''The Sarmatian Review, vol. 15'', No. 1].&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 20th century, Chernobyl was inhabited by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and some [[Poles|Polish]] [[peasant]]s, and a relatively large number of [[Jew]]s.

Chernobyl had a rich religious history. The Jews were brought by [[Filon Kmita]], during the Polish campaign of colonization. The traditionally Christian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Ukrainian peasantry of the district was largely forced, by Poland, to convert to the [[Greek Catholic]] Uniate religion after 1596, and then forceably returned to [[Eastern Orthodox]]y by the Tsar only after the Partitions of Poland. 
The [[Dominican order|Dominican]] church and [[monastery]] were founded in 1626 by Lukasz Sapieha, at the height of the [[Counter-reformation]]. There was a group of [[Old Catholics]], who opposed the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. The Dominican monastery was sequestrated in 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, and the church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;/&gt;

In the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became one of the major centers of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. The [[Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)|Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty]] had been founded by Rabbi [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]]. The Jewish population suffered greatly from [[pogrom]]s in October 1905 and in March–April 1919, when many Jews were killed and others were robbed, at the instigation of the Russian nationalist [[Black Hundreds]]. In 1920, the Twersky dynasty left Chernobyl, and it ceased to exist as a Hasidic centre.

Since the 1880s, Chernobyl has seen many changes of fortune. In 1898 Chernobyl had a population of 10,800, including 7,200 [[Jews]]. In [[World War I]] the village was occupied, and in the ensuing [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Civil War]], Chernobyl was fought over by [[Bolshevik]]s and Ukrainians. In the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919–20, it was taken first by the Polish Army and then by cavalry of the [[Red Army]]. From 1921, it was incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;/&gt;

During the period 1929–33, Chernobyl suffered greatly from mass killings during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[collectivization]] campaign, and in the [[Holodomor]] (famine) that followed. The Polish community of Chernobyl was deported to [[Kazakhstan]] in 1936 during the [[Frontier Clearances]]. The Jewish community was murdered during the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|German occupation of 1941–44]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;/&gt; Twenty years later, the area was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power station on Ukrainian soil.

The Duga-3 [[over-the-horizon radar]] array several miles out of Chernobyl was the origin of the infamous [[Russian Woodpecker]], designed as part of Russia's [[anti-ballistic missile]] [[early warning radar]] network.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of [[Ukraine]], now an independent nation.

However, in 2011 there continue to live a small number of people; those who refused to leave their native city after the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986.

==Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster==
&lt;!------
This article describes the city of Chernobyl. Please include information on the Chernobyl accident in [[Chernobyl disaster]].
--------&gt;
{{Main|Chernobyl disaster}}

On April 26, 1986, Reactor #4 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] near the town of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]], Ukraine, exploded. The explosion took place at 1:23am while the neighboring town of Pripyat slept. Two workers were killed instantly. 40 hours later, the residents of Pripyat were ordered to evacuate, and most never returned; by that time, many of the residents had suffered varying degrees of [[radiation poisoning]].

In 2003, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] launched a project called the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP)]] for the recovery of the affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&amp;projects=14 CRDP: Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (United Nations Development Program)]&lt;/ref&gt; The program launched its activities based on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations and was initiated in February 2002. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the [[Government of Ukraine]] to mitigate long-term social, economic and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe, among others. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: [[Kiev Oblast]], [[Zhytomyrska Oblast]], partially [[Kiev]], [[Chernihivska Oblast]] and [[Rivne Oblast]].

{{color swatch|#00FFFF|Cyan (&lt;tt&gt;#00FFFF&lt;/tt&gt;)|right}}
[[File:Cyan in Dictionary 1889.png|thumb|200px|In this 1889 dictionary, ''cyan-blue'' is defined as the blue-green color corresponding to wavelengths from 487 to 505 nm, corresponding to what is today called ''cyan.'']]

'''Cyan''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|aɪ|æ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cyan ''Cyan'' definition on dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
from {{lang-el|κύανoς}}, [[Romanization of Greek|transliterated]]: ''kýanos'', meaning &quot;dark blue substance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Fanos κύανος], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) may be used as the name of any of a number of colors in the blue/green range of the [[spectrum]]. In reference to the [[visible spectrum]] cyan is used to refer to the [[color]] obtained by mixing equal amounts of [[green]] and [[blue]] [[light]] or the removal of red from white light. As such, cyan is the [[complementary color|complement]] of [[red]] in [[RGB color model|RGB]] and [[CMYK color model]]s: cyan [[pigment]]s absorb red light.

''Cyan'' is also called [[aqua (color)|aqua]] or blue-green, and was previously known as &quot;cyan blue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Colorist: Designed to Correct the Commonly Held Theory that Red, Yellow, and Blue are the Primary Colors and to Supply the Much Needed Easy Method of Determining Color Harmony|author = J. Arthur H. Hatt|publisher = D. Van Nostrand Company|year = 1908|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qFa_qP780RQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22cyan+blue%22+%22three+color+printing%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=pxItSKTOGaectAPy3OnvAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tones of color close to cyan in the cyan color range are [[teal (color)|teal]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[Electric blue (color)|electric blue]] and [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]].

==Electric cyan vs. process cyan==
===Electric cyan (web color aqua)===
{{infobox color
|title= Cyan (additive secondary)
|hex= 00FFFF
|r = 0|g = 255|b = 255
|c = 100|m = 0|y = 0|k = 0
|h = 180|s = 100|v = 100
|source = [[Web colors#X11 color names|X11]]}}
The vivid cyan that is seen on an [[electronics|electronic]] [[display device]] (shown at right) is also referred to as '''electric cyan''' to distinguish it from the less vivid turquoise blue-like ''process cyan'' used in [[CMYK]] [[color printing]] (shown below). (Note: while the color is defined by definite [[RGB]] values, the display of the color will vary depending on the [[absolute color space]] used and the nature of the physical display device, e.g. computer monitor, and if this page is printed it is likely that the color shown will be far from representative.)

The [[web color]] aqua is an alias for electric cyan, that is, it is exactly the same color shown here as electric cyan.

To reproduce electric cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer's cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color. It is called '''aqua''' (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with [[water]], such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul ''The Dictionary of Color'' 1930 (see under Aqua in Index, Page 189)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

===Process cyan (pigment cyan) (printer's cyan)===
{{infobox color
|title= Cyan (subtractive primary)
|hex = 00B7EB
|r=  0|g=183|b=235
|c=100|m= 22|y=0  |k=8

Cyan is also one of the common inks used in [[four-color printing]], along with [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK as in spectrum(s).

While both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called ''cyan'', they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink can be more saturated or less saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what [[RGB color space]] and ink are considered.

Process cyan is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. A typical formulation of ''process cyan'' is shown in the color box at right.

==In nature==
===[[Molecule]]s===
*Pure water is nearly colorless. However, it does [[water absorption|absorb]] slightly more red light than blue, giving large volumes of water a bluish tint; increased scattering of blue light due to fine particles in the water shifts the blue color toward green, for a typically cyan net color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Clouds in a Glass of Beer: Simple Experiments in Atmospheric Physics|author = Craig F.

*[[Cyanide]] derives its name from [[Prussian blue]], a blue pigment containing the cyanide ion.

===[[Bacteria]]===
*[[Cyanobacteria]] (sometimes called blue-green algae) are an important link in the [[food chain]].

==In human culture==
===[[Architecture]]===
*Cyan colored [[tile]]s are often used to pave [[swimming pool]]s to make the water within them seem more intensely colored, and therefore more inviting.

===[[Astronomy]]===
*The [[planet]] [[Uranus]] is colored cyan because of the abundance of [[methane]] in its [[atmosphere]].

===[[Computer|Computers]]===
*[[CyanogenMod]] alternative firmware for the android OS.

===[[Personal computer game|Computer games]]/[[video game]]s===
*There is a [[computer game]] company called [[Cyan Worlds]] (a.k.a., [[Cyan, Inc.]]).
*There is a ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' character named [[Cyan Garamonde]].

===[[Energy]]===
*[[Natural gas]] (methane), used by many for [[home cooking]] on [[gas stove]]s, has a cyan colored [[flame]] when burned.

===[[Medicine]]===
*[[Cyanosis]] is an abnormal blueness of the skin, usually a sign of poor oxygen intake. i.e. the patient is &quot;cyanotic&quot;.

===[[Music]]===
*There is a band called [[Cyan (band)|Cyan]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[progressive rock]] band from the 1980s and 1990s.

===[[Photography]]===
*[[Cyanotype]], or [[blueprint]], a [[monochrome]] [[List of photographic processes|photographic printing process]] that predates the use of the word ''cyan'' as a color, yields a deep ''cyan-blue'' colored print based on the Prussian blue pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Cyanotype: the history, science and art of photographic printing in Prussian blue|author = Mike Ware|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=C-7I69gFIbMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;ots=alsMw9t0Kr&amp;dq=cyanotype+prussian-blue+color&amp;sig=s12O6C39teka_vg41EDxbflKMI4#PPA40,M1|publisher = NMSI Trading Ltd|year = 1999|isbn = 1900747073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conventional insulinotherapy''' is a therapeutic regimen for treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]] which contrasts with the newer [[intensive insulinotherapy]].

This older method (prior to the development home [[blood glucose monitoring]]) is still in use in a proportion of cases.

Conventional insulin therapy has these characteristics:
*Insulin injections of a mixture of rapid and intermediate acting insulin are performed two or three times daily.
*Meals are scheduled to match the anticipated peaks in the insulin profiles.
*The target range for blood glucose levels is higher than is desired in the intensive regimen.
*Frequent measurements of blood glucose levels were not used.

The down side of this method is that it is difficult to achieve as good results of [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|glycemic control]] as with intensive insulinotherapy.  The advantage is that, for diabetics with a regular lifestyle, the regime is less intrusive than the intensive therapy.

[[File:Milk-bottle.jpg|thumb|275px|A milk bottle showing cream risen to the top]]

'''Cream''' is a [[dairy product]] that is composed of the higher-[[butterfat]] layer skimmed from the top of [[milk]] before [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]]. In un-homogenized milk, over time, the lighter fat rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using [[centrifuge]]s called &quot;separators&quot;. In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.

Cream skimmed from milk may be called &quot;sweet cream&quot; to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from [[whey]], a [[by-product]] of [[cheese]]-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and &quot;cheesy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/ Article on sweet cream, whey cream, and the butters they produce]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cream produced by [[cows]] (particularly [[Jersey cattle]]) grazing on natural [[pasture]] often contains some natural [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the [[plant]]s they eat; this gives the cream a slight yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color, [[cream (color)|cream]]. Cream from goat's milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

==Types ==

{{globalize/Eng|date=November 2010}}

[[File:Stewed nectarines.JPG|thumb|right|Stewed [[nectarine]]s and heavy cream]]

Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions there are regulations for each type.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], cream is usually sold as:
*[[Half and half]] (10.5–18% fat)
*Light, coffee, or table cream (18–30% fat)
*Medium cream (25% fat)
*Whipping or light Whipping cream (30–36% fat)
*Heavy Whipping cream (36% or more)
*Extra-heavy, double, or manufacturer's cream (38–40% or more), generally not available at retail except at some warehouse and specialty stores.

Not all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content ranges vary. The above figures are based on the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Title 21, Part 131&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=131 FDA &gt; CDRH &gt; CFR Title 21 Database Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/21cfr131_05.html 2005 CFR Title 21, Volume 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a small sample{{Which?|date=February 2011}} of state regulations.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], levels of fat in cream are not regulated, therefore labels are only under the control of the manufacturers. A general guideline is as follows:

Extra light (or 'lite'): 12–12.5% fat.

Light (or 'lite'): 18–20% fat.

Pure cream: 35–56% fat, without artificial thickeners.

Thickened cream: 35–36.5% fat, with added gelatine and/or other thickeners to give the cream a creamier texture, also possibly with stabilisers to aid the consistency of whipped cream (this would be the cream to use for whipped cream, not necessarily for cooking)

Single cream: Recipes calling for 'single cream' are referring to pure or thickened cream with about 35% fat.

Double cream: 48–60% fat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=105898&amp;catId=100286&amp;tid=100008&amp;p=6&amp;title=Cream+and+sour+cream&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the [[United Kingdom]], the types of cream are legally defined&lt;ref&gt;Food Labelling Regulations 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

=== Canada ===

Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for that of &quot;light cream.&quot; In Canada, &quot;light cream&quot; is low-fat cream, with [http://www.dairygoodness.ca/cream/types-of-cream/5-or-6-light-cream-or-cream-and-milk-blend-for-coffee 5% or 6% fat]. Another form of cream available in Canada is &quot;cereal cream&quot;, which is approximately mid-way between 5% cream and coffee cream in fat content.

=== Japan ===

In Japan, cream sold in supermarkets is usually between 46% and 48% butterfat.

==Processing and additives==
Cream may have [[thickening agent]]s and [[Food additive|stabiliser]]s added. Thickeners include [[sodium alginate]], [[carrageenan]], [[gelatine]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[tetrasodium pyrophosphate]], and [[alginic acid]]&lt;ref name=DairyFats&gt;Dairy Fats and Related Products, edited by Adnan Tamime. This book has a great deal of technical information on cream and other dairy fat products. Extracts available on Google books [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9h9dnGz7aP0C&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=6Z3uB_hYUD&amp;dq=cream%20alginate%20carrageenan%20-ice&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q=cream%20alginate%20carrageenan%20-ice&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanagar.com/carrageenan.htm Carrageenan]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called &quot;feathering&quot;) when added to [[coffee]]. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of [[sodium caseinate]], although this is expensive.&lt;ref name=DairyFats/&gt;{{rp|297}}

==Other cream products==

[[File:Milkproducts v2.svg|thumb|275px|Chart of 50 types of milk products and relationships, including cream (click on image to enlarge).]]

{{nowrap|'''[[Butter]]''' is made}} by [[Churning (butter)|churning]] cream to separate the [[butterfat]] and [[buttermilk]]. This can be done by hand or by machine.

'''[[Whipped cream]]''' is made by [[whisk]]ing or [[mixer (cooking)|mixing]] [[air]] into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. [[Nitrous oxide]] may also be used to make whipped cream.

'''[[Sour cream]]''', common in many countries including the U.S. and Australia, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a [[bacteria]]l culture that produces [[lactic acid]] (0.5%+), which [[souring|sours]] and thickens it.

'''[[Crème fraîche]]''' (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican '''crema''' (or '''cream espesa''') is similar to crème fraîche.

'''[[Smetana (cream)|Smetana]]''' is a heavy cream product (35-40% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream.

'''Rjome''' or '''rømme''' is [[Norway|Norwegian]] sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] '''rjómi'''.

'''[[Clotted cream]]''', common in the United Kingdom, is cream that has been slowly heated to dry and thicken it, producing a very high-fat (55%) product. This is similar to Indian '''[[malai]]'''.

== Cream as an ingredient ==

Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including [[ice cream]], many [[sauce]]s, [[soup]]s, stews, puddings, and some [[custard]] bases, and is also used for cakes. [[Irish cream]] is an alcoholic liqueur which blends cream with [[whiskey]], and often [[honey]], [[wine]], or coffee. Cream is also used in curries such as masala dishes.

Cream (usually light/single cream or [[half and half]]) is often added to [[coffee]].

For cooking purposes, both single and double cream can be used in cooking, although the former can separate when heated, usually if there is a high acid content. Most UK chefs always use double cream or full-fat crème fraîche when cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent any problem with it separating or &quot;splitting&quot;. In sweet and savoury [[custard]]s such as those found in flan fillings, [[crème brûlée]]s and crème caramels, both types of cream are called for in different recipes depending on how rich a result is called for. It is useful to note that double cream can also be thinned down with water to make an approximation of single cream if necessary.

==Other items called &quot;cream&quot;==
Many non-edible substances are called creams due merely to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike waxy shoe polish; face cream is a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]]. There is generally no restriction on describing non-edible products as creams.

Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word ''cream'' for foods. Words such as ''creme'', ''kreme'', ''creame'', or ''whipped topping'' are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream. In some cases foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example in Britain &quot;[[ice cream]]&quot; does not have to be a dairy product (although it must be labelled &quot;contains non-milk fat&quot;), and [[salad cream]] is the customary name for a condiment that has been produced since the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=AN9457000306&amp;JournalCode=AN UK Ministry of food orders, 1945]&lt;/ref&gt; and need contain no cream.

'''Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)''' is a [[chemical process]] used to produce high-purity, high-performance solid materials. The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s. In a typical CVD process, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]], [[carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers]], [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[carbon nanotube]]s, [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[silicon-germanium]], [[tungsten]], [[silicon carbide]], [[silicon nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride]], [[titanium nitride]], and various [[high-k dielectric]]s. The CVD process is also used to produce [[synthetic diamond]]s.

==Types of chemical vapor deposition==
[[Image:ThermalCVD.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Hot-wall thermal CVD (batch operation type)]]
[[Image:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Plasma assisted CVD]]

A number of forms of CVD are in wide use and are frequently referenced in the literature. These processes differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated (e.g., activation process) and process conditions.

*Classified by operating pressure
**''Atmospheric pressure CVD'' (APCVD) – CVD processes at atmospheric pressure.
**''Low-pressure CVD'' (LPCVD) – CVD processes at subatmospheric pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.crystec.com/klllpcvde.htm|title=Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer. Most modern CVD processes are either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
**''Ultrahigh vacuum CVD'' (UHVCVD) – CVD processes at a very low pressure, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and [[ultra-high vacuum]] is common, often 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.
*Classified by physical characteristics of vapor
**''Aerosol assisted CVD'' (AACVD) – A CVD process in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
**''Direct liquid injection CVD'' (DLICVD) – A CVD process in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). Then the precursor vapors are transported to the substrate as in classical CVD process. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
*Plasma methods (see also [[Plasma processing]])
**''Microwave plasma-assisted CVD'' (MPCVD)
**''[[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma-Enhanced CVD]]'' (PECVD) – CVD processes that utilize [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.crystec.com/tridepe.htm|title=Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors.
**''Remote plasma-enhanced CVD'' (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
*''Atomic layer CVD'' ([[ALCVD]]) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, [[crystal]]line films. See [[Atomic layer epitaxy]].
*''[[Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (CCVD) – nGimat's proprietary Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition process is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.
*''Hot wire CVD'' (HWCVD) – also known as catalytic CVD (Cat-CVD) or hot filament CVD (HFCVD). Uses a hot filament to chemically decompose the source gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=R.E.I. | last=Schropp | coauthors=B. Stannowski, A.M. Brockhoff, P.A.T.T. van Veenendaal and J.K.

*''[[Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition]]'' (MOCVD) – CVD processes based on [[metalorganic]] precursors.
*''[[Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (HPCVD) – Vapor deposition processes that involve both chemical decomposition of precursor gas and [[vaporization]] of a solid source.
*''Rapid thermal CVD'' (RTCVD) – CVD processes that use heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas phase reactions that can lead to [[particle (ecology)|particle]] formation.

==Substances commonly deposited for ICs==
This section discusses the CVD processes often used for [[integrated circuits]] (ICs). Particular materials are deposited best under particular conditions.

===Polysilicon===
Polycrystalline silicon is deposited from [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following reaction:

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% [[nitrogen]]. Temperatures between 600 and 650 [[Celsius|°C]] and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050 °C to compensate.

Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

===Silicon dioxide===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply &quot;oxide&quot; in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include silane and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The reactions are as follows:

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

:Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500 °C, dichlorosilane at around 900 °C, and TEOS between 650 and 750 °C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or &quot;[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]&quot;). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] (&quot;P-glass&quot;) can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000 °C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850 °C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition process. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500 °C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

===Silicon nitride===
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[ohm|Ω]]·cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = S.M. Sze| publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =812651681X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals===
Some metals (notably aluminium and [[copper]]) are seldom or never deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, a commercially, cost effective, viable CVD process for copper did not exist, though copper formate, copper(hfac)2, Cu(II) ethyl acetoacetate, and other precursors have been used. Copper deposition of the metal has been done mostly by [[electroplating]], in order to reduce the cost. Aluminum can be deposited from tri-[[isobutyl]] aluminium (TIBAL), tri ethyl/methyl aluminum (TEA,TMA), or dimethylaluminum hydride (DMAH), but [[physical vapor deposition]] methods are usually preferred.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

However, CVD processes for [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], nickel, and tungsten are widely used{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. These metals can form useful [[silicide]]s when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal ''M'', the reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 M + 10 HCl

The usual source for tungsten is [[tungsten hexafluoride]], which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

The '''CN Tower''', sometimes formally referred to as '''Canada's National Tower''', is a communications and observation [[tower]] in [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Standing {{convert|553.3|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNTower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cntower.ca/portal/GetPage.aspx?at=848|title=CN Tower web site|accessdate=2007-09-26| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070723015815/http://www.cntower.ca/portal/GetPage.aspx?at=848| archivedate = July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was completed in 1976, becoming the [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world|world's tallest free-standing structure]] and [[List of tallest towers in the world|world's tallest tower]]. It held both records for 34 years until the completion of [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]] and [[Canton Tower]] in [[Guangzhou]]. It remains the tallest free-standing structure in the [[Western Hemisphere]], a signature icon of Toronto's skyline, and a symbol of Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2007/09/the_cn_tower_is.php The CN Tower is Dead.

Its name &quot;CN&quot; originally referred to [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]], the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to [[Divestment|divest]] non-core freight railway assets, prior to the company's [[privatization]] in 1995, it transferred the tower to the [[Canada Lands Company]], a federal [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]] responsible for [[real estate]] development. Since local residents wished to retain the name ''CN Tower'', the abbreviation is now said to expand to ''Canada's National Tower'', rather than the original ''Canadian National Tower''; however, neither of these names are commonly used.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven [[Wonders of the World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. It also belongs to the [[World Federation of Great Towers]], where it holds second-place ranking.

==History==
[[File:Toronto-view-from-cn-tower.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View from CN Tower at night]]
[[File:Gardiner Expressway Downtown Toronto.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east at the CN Tower from the [[Gardiner Expressway]].]]
The idea of the CN Tower originated when the 1968 [[Canadian National Railway]] had a desire to build a large TV and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, as well as demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972. The tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).

At the time, Toronto was a boom town, and the late 1960s and early 1970s had seen the construction of numerous large [[skyscraper]]s in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]]. This made broadcasting into the downtown area very difficult due to reflections off the buildings. The only solution was to raise the antennas above the buildings, demanding a tower over {{convert|300|m|ft|0}} tall. Additionally, at the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent &quot;hub&quot; space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area. The CN Tower can be seen from at least as far away as Kennedy Street in [[Aurora, Ontario]], approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} to the north, 60&amp;nbsp;km east of Toronto, in [[Oshawa]], and from several points on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]], {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} to the south in New York state in the United States.{{Or|date=July 2009}}

The original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical &quot;pillars&quot; linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the Sky Pod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the Sky Pod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.

The idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Sky Pod was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.

On June 26, 1986, the ten-year anniversary of the tower's opening, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate [[Dan Goodwin]], in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day.  Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyscraperdefense.com/building_climbs.html SkyscraperDefense.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CNtowerView.ogv|thumb|Southward view from the tower]]

On September 12, 2007, the CN Tower was surpassed by [[Burj Khalifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBCSurpassed&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= CN Tower dethroned by Dubai building|url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/09/12/cntower-surpassed.html|work= [[CBC News]]|publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date= 2007-09-12|accessdate=2008-04-09 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjGjwQa |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:Downtown Toronto from CN Tower1.jpg|thumb|left|350px|View of downtown Toronto from the CN Tower]]
Construction on the CN Tower began on February 6, 1973 with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|dirt]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|0}} of [[concrete]] with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|0}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|1}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.

To build the main support pillar, a hydraulically-raised [[slipform]] was built at the base. This was a fairly impressive engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured continuously by a team of 1,532 people until February 22, 1974, during which it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]], which was built using similar methods. In total, the tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|0}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb-bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1}}.

[[File:Cntower1974.jpg|thumb|Brackets being raised, August 1974]]
[[File:CNTowerLong.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The CN Tower as seen from its base]]
[[File:CNTowerNastyFall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The CN glass floor view]]
In August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Sky Pod was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.

The antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold off theirs to civilian operators. The helicopter, named &quot;Olga&quot;, was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections. The flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped off on April 2, 1975 after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from Moscow's [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|0|lk=on}}.

Two years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that &quot;All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,&quot; and that &quot;Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Robert (1995). ''Accidental city: the transformation of Toronto.'' MacFarlane, Walter &amp; Ross. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening===
The CN Tower opened to the public on June 26, 1976, although the official opening date was October 1, 1976. The construction costs of approximately [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]63 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|63000000|1976}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars){{inflation-fn|CA}} were repaid in fifteen years. [[Canadian National Railway]] sold the tower prior to taking the company private in 1995, when they decided to divest themselves of all operations not directly related to their core freight shipping businesses.

As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the introduction of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] in 1984 and [[Rogers Centre]] (known as the SkyDome before 2005) in 1989, the former Railway Lands were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the SkyWalk in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby railway and subway station, [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a boom in [[condominium]] construction in the 2000s and the 2010s.

From 1997 to January 2004, [[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn Corporation]] managed the tower and instituted several expansion projects including a $26 million entertainment expansion and revitalization that included the addition of two new elevators (to a total of six) and the relocation of the staircase from the north side leg to inside the core of the building, a conversion that also added nine stairs to the climb.

The CN Tower was closed during the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit|G-20 summit]] on June 26–27, 2010, for security reasons, given its proximity to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.

==Structure==
[[File:Toronto - ON - CN Tower Turmkorb.jpg|thumb|Main Pod]]
[[File:CN Tower Turmkorb-Modell-blau.png|thumb|Cross-section of the Main Pod]]
The CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the  six [[elevator]]s, [[Stairway|stairwells]], and power and plumbing connections. On top of this is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying TV and radio signals.  There are two visitor areas: the main deck level (formerly known as ''SkyPod'') located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher Sky Pod (formerly known as &quot;Space Deck&quot;) at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21|title= CN Tower|accessdate=2008-04-09|work= SkyscraperPage.com|publisher= Skyscraper Source Media|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjHU5r3 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The hexagonal shape can be seen between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large [[tripod]].

The main level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas&amp;nbsp;— at {{convert|338|m|ft|1}}&amp;nbsp;— is a large white donut-shaped [[radome]] containing the structure's microwave receivers. The [[glass floor]] and outdoor observation deck are at {{convert|342|m|ft|1}}. The glass floor has an area of {{convert|24|m2|sqft|0}} and can withstand a pressure of {{convert|4100|kPa|psi|0|lk=on}}. The floor's thermal glass units are {{convert|64|mm|in|1}} thick, consisting of a pane of {{convert|25|mm|in|1|adj=on}} laminated glass, {{convert|25|mm|in|1}} airspace and a pane of {{convert|13|mm|in|1|adj=on}} laminated glass. Some people experience [[acrophobia]] when standing on the glass floor and looking down at the ground {{convert|342|m|ft|1}} below. In 2008, one elevator was upgraded to add a glass floor panel, believed to have the highest vertical rise of any elevator equipped with this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Canadian Press|authorlink= Canadian Press|coauthors= |title= CN Tower's glass-floor elevator aims for record|url= http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/412944|work= [[Toronto Star]]|publisher= [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]]|date= 2008-04-09|accessdate=2008-04-09 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjI6ZFB |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}} {{cite news |last= Loriggio|first=Paola|title= CN Tower unveils glass-floor elevator|url= http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/413153|work= [[Toronto Star]]|publisher= [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]]|date= 2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-09 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjI6ZFB |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}} Both linked pages include a video of the elevator with glass floor in operation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Horizons Cafe and the lookout level are at {{convert|346|m|ft|1}}.

==Falling ice danger==
[[File:CN Tower seen from its base.jpg|thumb|left|CN Tower as seen from its base.]]
A [[freezing rain]] storm on March 2, 2007 resulted in a layer of ice several centimetres thick forming on the side of the tower and other downtown buildings. The sun thawed the ice, and winds of up to {{convert|90|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} blew some of it away from the structure. There were fears that cars and windows of nearby buildings would be smashed by large chunks of ice. In response, police closed some streets surrounding the tower. During morning rush hour on March 5, police expanded the area of closed streets to include the [[Gardiner Expressway]] {{convert|310|m|ft|0}} away from the tower, as increased winds blew the ice farther away, as far north as [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]], {{convert|490|m|ft|0}} away, where a [[taxicab]] window was shattered.

On March 6, the Gardiner Expressway was reopened after winds died down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citynews.ca/news/features_8415.aspx|title=Video: Falling CN Tower Ice|publisher=[[CITY-TV]] |date=2007-03-02|accessdate=2007-06-26|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjOujAX |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time such an event had posed a threat to public safety.

==Safety features==
[[File:insidecntower360.JPG|thumb|Inside the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower]]
In August 2000, a fire broke out at the [[Ostankino Tower]] in Moscow. It killed three people and caused extensive damage. The fire was blamed on poor maintenance and outdated equipment. The failure of the fire-suppression systems and the lack of proper equipment for firefighters allowed the fire to destroy most of the interior and spark fears the tower might even collapse.

The Ostankino Tower was completed only nine years before the CN Tower, and is only 13&amp;nbsp;metres (44&amp;nbsp;ft) shorter.&lt;ref name=doom&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/fire-in-1800ft-tv-tower-adds-to-russians-feeling-of-doom-711667.html Fire in 1,800ft TV tower adds to Russians' feeling of doom] by Helen Womackin, The Independent, August 29, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The parallels between the towers led to some concern that the CN Tower could be at risk of a similar tragedy. However, Canadian officials subsequently stated that it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that a similar disaster could occur at the CN Tower as it has important safeguards that were not present in the Ostankino Tower. Specifically, officials cited:

* the fireproof building materials used in the tower's construction,
* frequent and stringent safety inspections,
* an extensive sprinkler system,
* a 24-hour emergency monitoring operation,
* two 68,160-litre (15,000-imperial gallon) water reservoirs at the top, which are automatically replenished,
* a fire hose at the base of the structure capable of sending 2725 litres (600 imperial gallons) a minute to any location in the tower,
* a ban on gas appliances anywhere in the tower (including the restaurant in the main pod),
* an elevator that can be used during a fire as it runs up the outside of the building and can be powered by three emergency generators at the base of the structure (unlike the elevator at the Ostankino tower, which seriously malfunctioned).&lt;ref name=safety&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/08/28/CN000828.html|date=2000-11-10|title=What if the CN Tower Caught Fire?|work= [[CBC News]]|publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2007-06-26|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjP5iwp |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials also noted that the CN Tower has an excellent safety record and that there has never been an accidental fire in the tower since it was opened in 1976.&lt;ref name=safety /&gt; Moreover, other supertall structures built between 1967–1976&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Willis Tower]] (formerly the Sears Tower), the [[World Trade Center]] (until its [[September 11 attacks|destruction on September 11, 2001]]), the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]], the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]], the [[John Hancock Center]], and [[First Canadian Place]]&amp;nbsp;– also have excellent safety records, which suggests that the [[Ostankino Tower]] accident was a rare safety failure, and that the likelihood of similar events occurring at other supertall structures is extremely low.

==Lighting==
[[File:Toronto - ON - CN Tower bei Nacht2.jpg|thumb|left|The CN Tower illuminated, as seen from Toronto Islands]]
The CN Tower was once lit at night with [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] lights, but they were removed in 1997, because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright [[light-emitting diode|LED]] lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting up over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower's mast to light the tower from dusk until 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28 before the [[Canada Day]] holiday weekend.  The tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events.  After the [[95th Grey Cup]] in Toronto, the tower was lit up in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LED&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title= Highlighting the CN Tower&amp;nbsp;— Testing of Innovative Illumination Technology Begins Early June 2007|publisher= CN Tower|date= 2007-05-28|url= http://www.cntower.ca/portal/SmartDefault.aspx?at=1577|accessdate= 2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmed from a [[desktop computer]] with a [[wireless network interface controller]], the LEDs use less energy to light than the previously used incandescent lights (10% less energy than the dimly lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.

During the spring and autumn [[bird migration]] seasons, the lights will be turned off to comply with the voluntary Fatal Light Awareness Program, which &quot;encourages buildings to dim unnecessary exterior lighting to mitigate bird mortality during spring and summer migration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnw.pondeserver.com/story_details.asp?fn=115 CN Tower – Lighting Canada’s National Tower (includes video)]{{Dead link|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size comparisons==
[[File:Dubai-CN-Sears-towers.svg|thumb|• [[Burj Khalifa]], Dubai&lt;br /&gt;• CN Tower, Toronto&lt;br /&gt;• [[Willis Tower]] (formerly known as Sears Tower), Chicago]]
[[File:Tallest towers in the world.PNG|thumb|260px|Diagram of the tallest TV-Towers]]

===Willis Tower/One World Trade Center/Chicago Spire===
The CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the [[Americas]]. Currently, the only other [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world|freestanding structure in the Americas]] to exceed {{convert|500|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in height is the [[Willis Tower]] (formerly known as Sears Tower) in [[Chicago]], which stands at {{convert|527|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} when measured to its pinnacle. [[One World Trade Center]], currently under construction in [[New York City]], is expected to have a pinnacle height of {{convert|1776|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}, or approximately {{convert|12|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]), the height of One World Trade Center is unlikely to be increased. The [[Chicago Spire]] was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but it was cancelled in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/next/archives/2010/02/calatrava_dances_onto_a_new_stage.html Calatrava dances onto a new stage|Business Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future structures===
Between 2010 and 2013, the rank of the CN Tower in the list of the world tallest structures is expected to drop considerably. At least seven structures currently under construction, all of which are scheduled to be completed by 2013, are expected to exceed the CN Tower's height of 553.33&amp;nbsp;metres once completed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Controversy over the &quot;world's tallest&quot; title==
[[File:CN Tower as seen at night from its base.jpg|thumb|left|CN Tower as seen from its base at night.]]
[[Guinness World Records]] has called the CN Tower &quot;the world's tallest self-supporting tower&quot; and &quot;the world's tallest free-standing tower&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness 1982&quot;&gt;
{{Cite book |last=McWhirter|first=Norris| authorlink= Norris McWhirter| coauthors= | title=Guinness Book of World Records 1982 | year= 1981| publisher=[[Sterling Publishing|Sterling Publishing Co., Inc.]]| location= New York| isbn=978-0-8069-0225-8|oclc=7902975| page=704}} Reference is on page 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness 2005&quot;&gt;{{waybackdate |site= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record_subcategory.asp?txtDirection=right&amp;;txtButtonWasHit=true&amp;txtPage=4&amp;subcategoryid=37 |date= 20040925071143| title= Guinness Book of World Records 2005 - Science and Technology &lt;&lt; Buildings }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Guinness did list this description of the CN Tower under the heading &quot;tallest building&quot; at least once,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness 2005&quot;/&gt; it has also listed it under &quot;tallest tower&quot;, omitting it from its list of &quot;tallest buildings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness 1982&quot;/&gt; In 1996, Guinness changed the tower's classification to &quot;World's Tallest Building and Freestanding Structure&quot;. [[Emporis]] and the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] both list the CN Tower as the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|world's tallest free-standing structure on land]], and specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building, thereby awarding the title of [[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]] to [[Taipei 101]], which is {{convert|44|m|ft|0}} shorter than the CN Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0886190.html|title= World's Tallest Towers|accessdate=2008-04-10 |work= infoplease|publisher= [[Pearson Education]]|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjQPsd8 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CTBUH&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ctbuh.org/Resources/TallestDatabase/tabid/123/Default.aspx|title= CTBUH Tall Building Database|accessdate=2008-04-10 |date= |work= |publisher= [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]]|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjQeDX6 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower's official web site, however, still claims it is the &quot;world's tallest building&quot; as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CNCA&gt;

Although the CN Tower contains a restaurant, a gift shop, and multiple observation levels, it does not have floors continuously from the ground, and therefore [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|it is not considered a building]] by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) or Emporis. CTBUH defines a [[building]] as &quot;a structure that is designed for residential, business, or manufacturing purposes. An essential characteristic of a building is that it has floors.&quot;&lt;ref name=CTBUH/&gt; The CN Tower and other similar structures&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Ostankino Tower]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]; the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]; the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere Tower]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]; and the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]&amp;nbsp;— are categorized as &quot;towers&quot;, which are free-standing structures that may have observation decks and a few other habitable levels, but do not have floors from the ground up. The CN Tower is the tallest tower by this definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;info&quot;/&gt;

Taller than the CN Tower are numerous [[radio masts and towers]] which are held in place by [[guy-wire]]s, the tallest being the [[KVLY-TV mast]] in [[North Dakota]] at {{convert|628|m|ft|0}} tall, leading to [[List of masts|a distinction]] between these and &quot;free-standing&quot; structures. Additionally, the [[Petronius (oil platform)|Petronius Platform]] stands {{convert|610|m|ft|0}} above its base on the bottom of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but only the top {{convert|75|m|ft|0}} of this [[oil platform|oil and natural gas platform]] are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its [[buoyancy]].  Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings.

On September 12, 2007, [[Burj Khalifa]], which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and was formerly known as Burj Dubai, passed the CN Tower's 553.33&amp;nbsp;metre&lt;ref name=&quot;CNTower&quot;/&gt; height. The CN Tower held the record of tallest free-standing structure on land for over 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBCSurpassed&quot; /&gt;

After Burj Khalifa had been formally recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's tallest freestanding structure, Guinness re-certified CN Tower as the world's tallest freestanding tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/698891|title=CN tower now the 'world's tallest freestanding tower'|last=Daubs|first=Katie|date=2009-09-22|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=2009-09-22|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjR2lUu |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower definition used by Guinness was defined by [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] as 'a building in which less than 50% of the construction is usable floor space'. Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday announced Burj Khalifa was not classified as tower because it has too much usable floor space to be considered to be a tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2009/09/18/326566.aspx CN Tower remains world's tallest tower, Guinness says]&lt;/ref&gt; CN Tower still held world records for highest above ground wine cellar (in 360 Restaurant) at 351&amp;nbsp;metres, highest above ground restaurant at 346&amp;nbsp;metres (Horizons Restaurant),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/09/18/cn-tower-tallest-guiness523.html CN Tower still world's tallest: Guinness]&lt;/ref&gt; and tallest free-standing concrete tower during Guinness's recertification. The CN Tower was surpassed by the [[Canton Tower]] in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]], which stand at 600 m tall, as the world's tallest tower, in 2010.  The tower, as of 2010, stands as the third-tallest free-standing structure on land in the world and the second-tallest free-standing tower.

===Other height records===
Since the construction of the tower had been completed, it has gained following world height records:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cntower.ca/about_us/awards_and_records/records/ Let's Set the Record Straight The Tower, according to Guinness]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bobbie Rosenfeld Park==

The open space between [[Rogers Centre]] and CN Tower was renamed as '''Bobbie Rosenfeld Park''' in 1991 following the completion of the Rogers Centre (known as SkyDome at the time). The city-owned park is mainly an open space covered by paving stone and planters. There are some trees and concession stands selling food and other items to tourists and visitors in the area. 

There is a piece of artwork located along the south end facing Bremner Avenue by artist Susan Schelle called '''Salmon Run'''. The water fountain piece was not functional for many years, until it was restored in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/culture/public_art/ongoing.htm Ongoing Public Art - Toronto.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Calculus|cTopic=Differentiation}}
In [[calculus]], the '''chain rule''' is a [[formula]] for computing the [[derivative]] of the [[functional composition|composition]] of two or more [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. That is, if ''f'' is a function and ''g'' is a function, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of the composite function {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} in terms of the derivatives of ''f'' and ''g''.

In [[integral|integration]], the counterpart to the chain rule is the [[substitution rule]].

==History==
The chain rule seems to have first been used by [[Leibniz]]. He used it to calculate the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a + bz + cz^2}&lt;/math&gt; as the composite of the square root function and the function &lt;math&gt;a + bz + cz^2&lt;/math&gt;.  However, he did not state it as a separate rule, nor did anyone else for a long time.  [[L'Hopital]] uses the chain rule implicitly in his ''[[Analyse des infiniment petits]]'' but also does not state it explicitly.  The chain rule does not appear in any of [[Leonhard Euler]]'s analysis books, even though they were written over a hundred years after Leibniz's discovery.  The first explicit and modern statement of the chain rule was in [[Lagrange]]'s 1797 ''Théorie des fonctions analytiques''.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez Rodriguez and Lopez Fernandez, ''A Semiotic Reflection on the Didactics of the Chain Rule'', The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast, ISSN 1551-3440, Vol. 7, nos.2&amp;3, pp.321–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The chain rule in one dimension==
: ''For an explanation of notation used in this section, see [[Function composition]].''

===First example===
Suppose that a skydiver jumps from an aircraft.  Assume that ''t'' seconds after his jump, his height above sea level in meters is given by {{nowrap begin}}''g''(''t'') = 4000 &amp;minus; 4.9''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  One model for the [[atmospheric pressure]] at a height ''h'' is {{nowrap begin}}''f''(''h'') = 101325''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;0.0001''h''&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  These two equations can be differentiated and combined in various ways to produce the following data:
*{{nowrap begin}}''g''&amp;prime;(''t'') = &amp;minus;9.8''t''{{nowrap end}} is the velocity of the skydiver at time ''t''.
*{{nowrap begin}}''f''&amp;prime;(''h'') = 10.1325''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;0.0001''h''&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}} is the rate of change in atmospheric pressure with respect to height at the height ''h'' and is proportional to the [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] on the skydiver at ''h'' meters above sea level.  (The true buoyant force depends on the volume of the skydiver.)
*{{nowrap|(''f'' ∘ ''g'')(''t'')}} is the atmospheric pressure the skydiver experiences ''t'' seconds after his jump.
*{{nowrap|(''f'' ∘ ''g'')&amp;prime;(''t'')}} is the rate of change in atmospheric pressure with respect to time at ''t'' seconds after the skydiver's jump and is proportional to the buoyant force on the skydiver at ''t'' seconds after his jump.
The chain rule gives a method for computing {{nowrap|(''f'' ∘ ''g'')&amp;prime;(''t'')}} in terms of {{nowrap|''f''&amp;prime;}} and {{nowrap|''g''&amp;prime;}}.  While it is always possible to directly apply the definition of the derivative to compute the derivative of a composite function, this is usually very difficult.  The utility of the chain rule is that it turns a complicated derivative into several easy derivatives.

The chain rule states that, under appropriate conditions,
:&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)'(t) = f'(g(t))g'(t).&lt;/math&gt;
In this example, this equals
:&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)'(t) = \big(10.1325e^{-0.0001(4000 - 4.9t^2)}\big)\cdot\big(\mathbin{-}9.8t\big).&lt;/math&gt;

In the statement of the chain rule, ''f'' and ''g'' play slightly different roles because ''f''&amp;prime; is evaluated at ''g''(''t'') whereas ''g''&amp;prime; is evaluated at ''t''.  This is necessary to make the units work out correctly.  For example, suppose that we want to compute the rate of change in atmospheric pressure ten seconds after the skydiver jumps.  This is {{nowrap|(''f'' ∘ ''g'')&amp;prime;(10)}} and has units of [[Pascal (unit)|Pascal]]s per second.  The factor ''g''&amp;prime;(10) in the chain rule is the velocity of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump, and it is expressed in meters per second.  ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(10)) is the change in pressure with respect to height at the height ''g''(10) and is expressed in Pascals per meter.  The product of ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(10)) and ''g''&amp;prime;(10) therefore has the correct units of Pascals per second.  It is not possible to evaluate ''f'' anywhere else.  For instance, because the 10 in the problem represents ten seconds, the expression ''f''&amp;prime;(10) represents the change in pressure at a height of ten seconds, which is nonsense.  Similarly, because {{nowrap|''g''&amp;prime;(10) {{=}} &amp;minus;98}} meters per second, the expression ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''&amp;prime;(10)) represents the change in pressure at a height of &amp;minus;98 meters per second, which is also nonsense.  However, ''g''(10) is 3020 meters above sea level, the height of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump.  This has the correct units for an input to ''f''.

===Statement of the rule===

The simplest form of the chain rule is for real-valued functions of one [[real number|real]] variable.  It says that if ''g'' is a function that is differentiable at a point ''c'' (i.e.&amp;nbsp;the derivative ''g''&amp;prime;(''c'') exists) and ''f'' is a function that is differentiable at ''g''(''c''), then the composite function ''f''&amp;nbsp;∘&amp;nbsp;''g'' is differentiable at ''c'', and the derivative is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|authorlink=Tom Apostol|first=Tom|last=Apostol|year=1974|edition=2nd ed.|publisher=Addison Wesley|page=Theorem 5.5|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (f\circ g)'(c) = f'(g(c))\cdot g'(c). &lt;/math&gt;

The rule is sometimes abbreviated as

:&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)' = (f'\circ g) \cdot g'.\, &lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap begin}}''y'' = ''f''(''u''){{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''u'' = ''g''(''x''){{nowrap end}}, then this abbreviated form is written in [[Leibniz notation]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

The points where the derivatives are evaluated may also be stated explicitly:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=c} = \left.\frac{dy}{du}\right|_{u = g(c)} \cdot \left.\frac{du}{dx}\right|_{x=c}.\, &lt;/math&gt;

===Further examples===
====The chain rule in the absence of formulas====
It may be possible to apply the chain rule even when there are no formulas for the functions which are being differentiated.  This can happen when the derivatives are measured directly.  For example, suppose that a car is driving up a tall mountain.  The car's speedometer measures its velocity directly.  If the [[grade (slope)|grade]] is known, then the rate of ascent can be calculated using [[trigonometry]].  Suppose that the car is ascending at 2.5&amp;nbsp;km/h.  Standard models for the Earth's atmosphere imply that the temperature drops about 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer ascended (see [[lapse rate]]).  To find the temperature drop per hour, we apply the chain rule.  Let the function ''g''(''t'') be the altitude of the car at time ''t'', and let the function ''f''(''h'') be the temperature ''h'' kilometers above sea level.  ''f'' and ''g'' are not known exactly: For example, the altitude where the car starts is not known and the temperature on the mountain is not known.  However, their derivatives are known: ''f''&amp;prime; is &amp;minus;6.5&amp;nbsp;°C/km , and ''g''&amp;prime; is 2.5&amp;nbsp;km/h.  The chain rule says that the derivative of the composite function is the product of the derivative of ''f'' and the derivative of ''g''.  This is {{nowrap begin}}&amp;minus;6.5 °C/km · 2.5 km/h = &amp;minus;16.25 °C/h{{nowrap end}}.

One of the reasons why this computation is possible is because ''f''&amp;prime; is a constant function.  This is because the above model is very simple.  A more accurate description of how the temperature near the car varies over time would require an accurate model of how the temperature varies at different altitudes.  This model may not have a constant derivative.  To compute the temperature change in such a model, it would be necessary to know ''g'' and not just ''g''&amp;prime;, because without knowing ''g'' it is not possible to know where to evaluate ''f''&amp;prime;.

====Composites of more than two functions====
The chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions.  To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of ''f'', ''g'', and ''h'' (in that order) is the composite of ''f'' with {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''h''}}.  The chain rule says that to compute the derivative of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g'' ∘ ''h''}}, it is sufficient to compute the derivative of ''f'' and the derivative of {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''h''}}.  The derivative of ''f'' can be calculated directly, and the derivative of {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''h''}} can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.

For concreteness, consider the function
:&lt;math&gt;y = e^{\sin {x^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y &amp;= f(u) = e^u, \\
u &amp;= g(v) = \sin v, \\
v &amp;= h(x) = x^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Their derivatives are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{du} &amp;= f'(u) = e^u, \\
\frac{du}{dv} &amp;= g'(v) = \cos v, \\
\frac{dv}{dx} &amp;= h'(x) = 2x.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The chain rule says that the derivative of their composite at the point {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = ''a''{{nowrap end}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g \circ h)'(a) = f'((g \circ h)(a))(g \circ h)'(a) = f'((g \circ h)(a))g'(h(a))h'(a).&lt;/math&gt;
In Leibniz notation, this is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \left.\frac{dy}{du}\right|_{u=g(h(a))}\cdot\left.\frac{du}{dv}\right|_{v=h(a)}\cdot\left.\frac{dv}{dx}\right|_{x=a},&lt;/math&gt;
or for short,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dv}\cdot\frac{dv}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;
The derivative function is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{\sin {x^2}}\cdot\cos{x^2}\cdot 2x.&lt;/math&gt;

Another way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g'' ∘ ''h''}} as the composite of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} and ''h''.  Applying the chain rule to this situation gives:
:&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g \circ h)'(a) = (f \circ g)'(h(a))h'(a) = f'(g(h(a))g'(h(a))h'(a).&lt;/math&gt;
This is the same as what was computed above.  This should be expected because {{nowrap|(''f'' ∘ ''g'') ∘ ''h'' {{=}} ''f'' ∘ (''g'' ∘ ''h'')}}.

====The quotient rule====
{{see also|Quotient rule}}
The chain rule can be used to derive some well-known differentiation rules.  For example, the quotient rule is a consequence of the chain rule and the product rule.  To see this, write the function ''f''(''x'')/''g''(''x'') as the product {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') &amp;middot; 1/''g''(''x'')}}.  First apply the product rule:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)
&amp;= \frac{d}{dx}\left(f(x)\cdot\frac{1}{g(x)}\right) \\
&amp;= f'(x)\cdot\frac{1}{g(x)} + f(x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{g(x)}\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
To compute the derivative of 1/''g''(''x''), notice that it is the composite of ''g'' with the reciprocal function, that is, the function that sends ''x'' to 1/''x''.  The derivative of the reciprocal function is &amp;minus;1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  By applying the chain rule, the last expression becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)\cdot\frac{1}{g(x)} + f(x)\cdot\left(-\frac{1}{g(x)^2}\cdot g'(x)\right)
= \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2},&lt;/math&gt;
which is the usual formula for the quotient rule.

====Derivatives of inverse functions====
Suppose that {{nowrap begin}}''y'' = ''g''(''x''){{nowrap end}} has an [[inverse function]].  Call its inverse function ''f'' so that we have {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = ''f''(''y''){{nowrap end}}.  There is a formula for the derivative of ''f'' in terms of the derivative of ''g''.  To see this, note that ''f'' and ''g'' satisfy the formula
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(x)) = x.&lt;/math&gt;
Because the functions ''f''(''g''(''x'')) and ''x'' are equal, their derivatives must be equal.  The derivative of ''x'' is the constant function with value 1, and the derivative of ''f''(''g''(''x'')) is determined by the chain rule.  Therefore we have:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
To express ''f''&amp;prime; as a function of an independent variable ''y'', we substitute ''f''(''y'') for ''x'' wherever it appears.  Then we can solve for ''f''&amp;prime;.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f'(g(f(y)))g'(f(y)) &amp;= 1 \\
f'(y)g'(f(y)) &amp;= 1 \\
f'(y) = \frac{1}{g'(f(y))}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the function {{nowrap begin}}''g''(''x'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  It has an inverse which is denoted {{nowrap begin}}''f''(''y'') = ln ''y''{{nowrap end}}.  Because {{nowrap begin}}''g''&amp;prime;(''x'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}, the above formula says that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dy}\ln y = \frac{1}{e^{\ln y}} = \frac{1}{y}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is true whenever ''g'' is differentiable and its inverse ''f'' is also differentiable.  This formula can fail when one of these conditions is not true.  For example, consider {{nowrap begin}}''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Its inverse is {{nowrap begin}}''f''(''y'') = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}, which is not differentiable at zero.  If we attempt to use the above formula to compute the derivative of ''f'' at zero, then we must evaluate 1/''g''&amp;prime;(''f''(0)).  {{nowrap begin}}''f''(0) = 0{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''g''&amp;prime;(0) = 0{{nowrap end}}, so we must evaluate 1/0, which is undefined.  Therefore the formula fails in this case.  This is not surprising because ''f'' is not differentiable at zero.

===Higher derivatives===
[[Faà di Bruno's formula]] generalizes the chain rule to higher derivatives.  The first few derivatives are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d (f \circ g) }{dx} = \frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d^2 (f \circ g) }{d x^2}
  = \frac{d^2 f}{d g^2}\left(\frac{dg}{dx}\right)^2
    + \frac{df}{dg}\frac{d^2 g}{dx^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d^3 (f \circ g) }{d x^3}
  = \frac{d^3 f}{d g^3} \left(\frac{dg}{dx}\right)^3 
    + 3 \frac{d^2 f}{d g^2} \frac{dg}{dx} \frac{d^2 g}{d x^2}
    + \frac{df}{dg} \frac{d^3 g}{d x^3} 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d^4 (f \circ g) }{d x^4}
  =\frac{d^4 f}{dg^4} \left(\frac{dg}{dx}\right)^4 
    + 6 \frac{d^3 f}{d g^3} \left(\frac{dg}{dx}\right)^2 \frac{d^2 g}{d x^2} 
    + \frac{d^2 f}{d g^2} \left\{ 4 \frac{dg}{dx} \frac{d^3 g}{dx^3} + 3\left(\frac{d^2 g}{dx^2}\right)^2\right\}
    + \frac{df}{dg}\frac{d^4 g}{dx^4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Proofs of the chain rule===
====First proof====
One proof of the chain rule begins with the definition of the derivative:
:&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x - a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Assume for the moment that ''g''(''x'') does not equal ''g''(''a'') for any ''x'' near ''a''.  Then the previous expression is equal to the product of two factors:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x - a}.&lt;/math&gt;
When ''g'' oscillates near ''a'', then it might happen that no matter how close one gets to ''a'', there is always an even closer ''x'' such that ''g''(''x'') which equals ''g''(''a'').  For example, this happens for {{nowrap|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin(1 / ''x'')}} near the point {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} 0}}.  Whenever this happens, the above expression is undefined because it involves [[division by zero]].  To work around this, introduce a function ''Q'' as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;Q(y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{f(y) - f(g(a))}{y - g(a)}, &amp; y \neq g(a), \\
f'(g(a)), &amp; y = g(a).
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
We will show that the difference quotient for {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is always equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;Q(g(x)) \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x - a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Whenever ''g''(''x'') is not equal to ''g''(''a''), this is clear because the factors of {{nowrap|''g''(''x'') - ''g''(''a'')}} cancel.  When ''g''(''x'') equals ''g''(''a''), then the difference quotient for {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is zero because ''f''(''g''(''x'')) equals ''f''(''g''(''a'')), and the above product is zero because it equals ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(''a'')) times zero.  So the above product is always equal to the difference quotient, and to show that the derivative of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} at ''a'' exists and to determine its value, we need only show that the limit as ''x'' goes to ''a'' of the above product exists and determine its value.

To do this, recall that the limit of a product exists if the limits of its factors exist.  When this happens, the limit of the product of these two factors will equal the product of the limits of the factors.  The two factors are ''Q''(''g''(''x'')) and {{nowrap|(''g''(''x'') - ''g''(''a'')) / (''x'' - ''a'')}}.  The latter is the difference quotient for ''g'' at ''a'', and because ''g'' is differentiable at ''a'' by assumption, its limit as ''x'' tends to ''a'' exists and equals ''g''&amp;prime;(''a'').

It remains to study ''Q''(''g''(''x'')).  ''Q'' is defined wherever ''f'' is.  Furthermore, because ''f'' is differentiable at ''g''(''a'') by assumption, ''Q'' is continuous at ''g''(''a'').  ''g'' is continuous at ''a'' because it is differentiable at ''a'', and therefore {{nowrap|''Q'' ∘ ''g''}} is continuous at ''a''.  So its limit as ''x'' goes to ''a'' exists and equals ''Q''(''g''(''a'')), which is ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(''a'')).

This shows that the limits of both factors exist and that they equal ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(''a'')) and ''g''&amp;prime;(''a''), respectively.  Therefore the derivative of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} at ''a'' exists and equals ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(''a''))''g''&amp;prime;(''a'').

====Second proof====
Another way of proving the chain rule is to measure the error in the linear approximation determined by the derivative.  This proof has the advantage that it generalizes to several variables.  It relies on the following equivalent definition of differentiability at a point: A function ''g'' is differentiable at ''a'' if there exists a real number ''g''&amp;prime;(''a'') and a function &amp;epsilon;(''h'') such that as ''h'' tends to zero, &amp;epsilon;(''h'') tends to 0, and furthermore
:&lt;math&gt;g(a + h) - g(a) = g'(a)h + \varepsilon(h)h.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Here the left-hand side represents the true difference between the value of ''g'' at ''a'' and at {{nowrap|''a'' + ''h''}}, whereas the right-hand side represents the approximation determined by the derivative plus an error term.

In the situation of the chain rule, such a function &amp;epsilon; exists because ''g'' is assumed to be differentiable at ''a''.  Again by assumption, a similar function also exists for ''f'' at ''g''(''a'').  Calling this function &amp;eta;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(a) + k) - f(g(a)) = f'(g(a))k + \eta(k)k.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The above definition imposes no constraints on &amp;eta;(0), even though it is assumed that &amp;eta;(''k'') tends to zero as ''k'' tends to zero.  If we set {{nowrap|&amp;eta;(0) {{=}} 0}}, then &amp;eta; is continuous at 0.

To prove the theorem, first apply the definition of differentiability of ''g'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')):
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a)) = f(g(a) + g'(a)h + \varepsilon(h)h) - f(g(a)).&lt;/math&gt;
Set {{nowrap|''k''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''g''&amp;prime;(''a'')''h'' + &amp;epsilon;(''h'')''h''}} and apply the definition of differentiability of ''f'' to get:
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(a) + k_h) - f(g(a)) = f'(g(a))k_h + \eta(k_h)k_h. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the right-hand side of this equation, expanding ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, and grouping the terms yields:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(g(a))g'(a)h + [f'(g(a))\varepsilon(h) + \eta(k_h)g'(a) + \eta(k_h)\varepsilon(h)]h. \,&lt;/math&gt;
As ''h'' tends to zero, the bracketed terms tend to zero.  Consequently, the derivative of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} at ''a'' exists and equals ''f''&amp;prime;(''g''(''a''))''g''&amp;prime;(''a'').

The role of ''Q'' in the first proof is played by &amp;eta; in this proof.  They are related by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;Q(y) = f'(g(a)) + \eta(y - g(a)). \,&lt;/math&gt;
The need to define ''Q'' at ''g''(''a'') is analogous to the need to define &amp;eta; at zero.  However, the proofs are not exactly equivalent.  The first proof relies on a theorem about products of limits to show that the derivative exists.  The second proof does not need this because showing that the error terms vanish proves the existence of the limit directly.

==The chain rule in higher dimensions==
The simplest generalization of the chain rule to higher dimensions uses the [[total derivative]].  The total derivative is a linear transformation that captures how the function changes in all directions.  Let {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} be differentiable functions, and let ''D'' be the total derivative operator.  If '''a''' is a point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the higher dimensional chain rule says that:
:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathbf{a}}(f \circ g) = D_{g(\mathbf{a})}f \circ D_{\mathbf{a}}g,&lt;/math&gt;
or for short,
:&lt;math&gt;D(f \circ g) = Df \circ Dg.&lt;/math&gt;
The higher-dimensional chain rule can be proved using a technique similar to the second proof given above.

In terms of [[Jacobian matrix|Jacobian matrices]], the rule says
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\mathbf{a}}(f \circ g) = J_{g(\mathbf{a})}(f)J_{\mathbf{a}}(g),&lt;/math&gt;
That is, the Jacobian of the composite function is the product of the Jacobians of the composed functions.  In one dimension, the Jacobian matrix has a single entry, the ordinary derivative.  Therefore this form of the higher dimensional chain rule recovers the one dimensional chain rule.

Another way of writing the chain rule is used when ''f'' and ''g'' are expressed in terms of their components as {{nowrap begin}}'''y''' = ''f''('''u''') = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''u'''), ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')){{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}'''u''' = ''g''('''x''') = (''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x'''), ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''')){{nowrap end}}.  In this case, the above rule for Jacobian matrices is usually written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(f_1, \ldots, f_k)}{\partial(x_1, \ldots, x_n)} = \frac{\partial(f_1, \ldots, f_k)}{\partial(u_1, \ldots, u_m)}\frac{\partial(g_1, \ldots, g_m)}{\partial(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The chain rule for total derivatives implies a chain rule for partial derivatives.  Recall that when the total derivative exists, the partial derivative in the ''i''th coordinate direction is found by multiplying the Jacobian matrix by the ''i''th basis vector.  By doing this to the formula above, we find:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(f_1, \ldots, f_k)}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial(f_1, \ldots, f_k)}{\partial(u_1, \ldots, u_m)}\frac{\partial(g_1, \ldots, g_m)}{\partial x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the entries of the Jacobian matrix are partial derivatives, we may simplify the above formula to get:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(f_1, \ldots, f_k)}{\partial x_i} = \sum_{\ell = 1}^m \frac{\partial(f_1, \ldots, f_k)}{\partial u_\ell}\frac{\partial g_\ell}{\partial x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;
More conceptually, this rule expresses the fact that a change in the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; direction may change all of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and any of these changes may affect ''f''.

In the special case where {{nowrap begin}}''k'' = 1{{nowrap end}}, so that ''f'' is a real-valued function, then this formula simplifies even further:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \sum_{\ell = 1}^m \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_\ell}\frac{\partial g_\ell}{\partial x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
Given &lt;math&gt;\,u = x^2 + 2y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\,x = r\sin(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,y = \sin^2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, determine the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; using the chain rule.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial r} = \left(2x\right)\left(\sin(t)\right)+\left(2\right)\left(0\right)=2r\sin^2(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \left(2x\right)\left(r\cos(t)\right)+\left(2\right)\left(2\sin(t)\cos(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = 2\left(r\sin(t)\right)r\cos(t)+4\sin(t)\cos(t) = 2\left(r^2+2\right)\sin(t)\cos(t).&lt;/math&gt;

==Further generalizations==
All extensions of calculus have a chain rule.  In most of these, the formula remains the same, though the meaning of that formula may be vastly different.

One generalization is to [[manifold]]s.  In this situation, the chain rule represents the fact that the derivative of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is the composite of the derivative of ''f'' and the derivative of ''g''.  This theorem is an immediate consequence of the higher dimensional chain rule given above, and it has exactly the same formula.

The chain rule is also valid for [[Fréchet derivative]]s in [[Banach space]]s.  The same formula holds as before.  This case and the previous one admit a simultaneous generalization to [[Banach manifold]]s.

In [[abstract algebra]], the derivative is interpreted as a morphism of modules of [[Kähler differential]]s.  A [[ring homomorphism]] of [[commutative ring]]s {{nowrap|''f'' : ''R'' &amp;rarr; ''S''}} determines a morphism of Kähler differentials {{nowrap|''Df'' : &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} which sends an element ''dr'' to ''d''(''f''(''r'')), the exterior differential of ''f''(''r'').  The formula {{nowrap begin}}''D''(''f'' ∘ ''g'') = ''Df'' ∘ ''Dg''{{nowrap end}} holds in this context as well.

The common feature of these examples is that they are expressions of the idea that the derivative is part of a [[functor]].  A functor is an operation on spaces and functions between them.  It associates to each space a new space and to each function between two spaces a new function between the corresponding new spaces.  In each of the above cases, the functor sends each space to its [[tangent bundle]] and it sends each function to its derivative.  There is one requirement for such an operation to be a functor, namely that the derivative of a composite is the composite of the derivatives.  This is exactly the formula {{nowrap begin}}''D''(''f'' ∘ ''g'') = ''Df'' ∘ ''Dg''{{nowrap end}}.

There are also chain rules in [[stochastic calculus]].  One of these, [[Itō's lemma]], expresses the composite of an Itō process (or more generally a [[semimartingale]]) ''dX''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; with a twice-differentiable function ''f''.  In Itō's lemma, the derivative of the composite function depends not only on ''dX''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; and the derivative of ''f'' but also on the second derivative of ''f''.  The dependence on the second derivative is a consequence of the non-zero [[quadratic variation]] of the stochastic process, which broadly speaking means that the process can move up and down in a very rough way.  This variant of the chain rule is not an example 
of a functor because the two functions being composed are of different types.

[[File:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that '''P''' ≠ '''NP'''.

The '''P versus NP problem''' is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]].  Informally, it asks whether every  problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a computer can also be efficiently ''solved'' by a computer.   It was introduced in 1971 by [[Stephen Cook]] in his paper &quot;The complexity of theorem proving procedures&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]], [http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/pnp-cacm.pdf ''The status of the P versus NP problem''], Communications of the ACM 52 (2009), no.&amp;nbsp;9, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–86. {{doi|10.1145/1562164.1562186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] selected by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] to carry a US$ 1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.

In essence, the question '''P''' = '''NP'''? asks:

{{quote|Suppose that solutions to a problem can be verified quickly.  Then, can the solutions themselves also be computed quickly?}}

The theoretical notion of ''quick'' used here is an algorithm that runs in [[polynomial time]]. The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called &quot;class P&quot; or just &quot;'''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''&quot;.

For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it may be possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be verified in polynomial time is called '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]'''.

Consider the [[subset sum problem]], an example of a problem that is easy to verify, but whose answer may be difficult to compute. Given a set of [[integer]]s, does some nonempty [[subset]] of them sum to 0? For instance, does a subset of the set {{nowrap| {−2, −3, 15, 14, 7, −10} }} add up to 0? The answer &quot;yes, because {{nowrap| {−2, −3, −10, 15} }} add up to zero&quot; can be quickly verified with three additions.  However, there is no known algorithm to find such a subset in polynomial time (there is, however, in [[exponential time]], which consists of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 tries), and indeed such an algorithm cannot exist if the two complexity classes are not the same; hence this problem is in '''NP''' (quickly checkable) but not necessarily in '''P''' (quickly solvable).

An answer to the '''P'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP''' question would determine whether problems like the subset-sum problem that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that '''P''' does not equal '''NP''', it would mean that there are problems in '''NP''' (such as [[NP-complete]] problems) that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.

==Context==
The relation between the [[complexity class]]es '''P''' and '''NP''' is studied in [[computational complexity theory]], the part of the [[theory of computation]] dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).

In such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is [[Deterministic computation|''deterministic'']] (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and ''sequential'' (it performs actions one after the other).

In this theory, the class '''P''' consists of all those ''[[decision problem]]s'' (defined [[#Formal definitions for P and NP|below]]) that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is [[polynomial]] in the size of the input; the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in [[polynomial time]] given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser, Michael: ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Second Edition, International Edition'', page 270. Thomson Course Technology, 2006. Definition 7.19 and Theorem 7.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, '''P''' ⊆ '''NP'''. Arguably the biggest open question in [[theoretical computer science]] concerns the relationship between those two classes:
:Is '''P''' equal to '''NP'''?
In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 believed the answer to be no, 9 believed the answer is yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 believed the question may be [[independent (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the currently accepted axioms and so impossible to prove or disprove.&lt;ref name=&quot;poll&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=William I. Gasarch|title=The P=?NP poll.|journal=SIGACT News|volume=33|issue=2|pages=34–47|month=June | year=2002|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll.pdf|doi=10.1145/1052796.1052804|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NP-complete==
[[File:P np np-complete np-hard.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Euler diagram]] for [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], NP-complete, and NP-hard set of problems]]
{{Main|NP-complete}}
To attack the '''P''' = '''NP''' question the concept of '''NP'''-completeness is very useful. Informally the '''NP'''-complete problems are the &quot;toughest&quot; problems in '''NP''' in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in '''P'''. '''NP'''-complete problems are a set of problems that any other '''NP'''-problem can be reduced to in polynomial time, but retain the ability to have their solution verified in polynomial time. In comparison, [[NP-hard|'''NP'''-hard]] problems are those at least as hard as '''NP'''-complete problems, meaning all '''NP'''-problems can be reduced to them, but not all '''NP'''-hard problems are in '''NP''', meaning not all of them have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.

For instance, the decision problem version of the [[travelling salesman problem]] is '''NP'''-complete, so ''any'' instance of ''any'' problem in '''NP''' can be transformed mechanically into an instance of the traveling salesman problem, in polynomial time. The traveling salesman problem is one of many such '''NP'''-complete problems. If any '''NP'''-complete problem is in '''P''', then it would follow that '''P''' = '''NP'''. Unfortunately, many important problems have been shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and as of 2011 not a single fast algorithm for any of them is known.

Based on the definition alone it's not obvious that '''NP'''-complete problems exist. A trivial and contrived '''NP'''-complete problem can be formulated as: given a description of a Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept?&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=Scott Aaronson|title=PHYS771 Lecture 6: P, NP, and Friends|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec6.html |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in '''NP''' because (given an input) it is simple to check whether or not M accepts the input by simulating M; it is '''NP'''-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in '''NP''' can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.

The first natural problem proven to be '''NP'''-complete was the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. This result
came to be known as [[Cook–Levin theorem]]; its
proof that satisfiability is NP-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of '''NP'''. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, [[reduction (complexity)|proof by reduction]] provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are in this class. Thus, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense &quot;the same problem&quot;.

==Harder problems==
{{See also|Complexity class}}

Although it is unknown whether '''P''' = '''NP''', problems outside of '''P''' are known. A number of succinct problems (problems that operate not on normal input, but on a computational description of the input) are known to be [[EXPTIME#EXPTIME-complete|'''EXPTIME'''-complete]]. Because it can be shown that '''P''' &lt;math&gt;\subsetneq&lt;/math&gt; '''[[EXPTIME]]''', these problems are outside '''P''', and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the [[time hierarchy theorem]], they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for chess (on an N×N board)&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraenkel1981&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D. Lichtenstein| title = Computing a perfect strategy for n×n chess requires time exponential in n| journal = J. Comb. Th. A| issue = 31| year = 1981| pages = 199–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other board games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Computational Complexity of Games and Puzzles |url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/hard.html |author=David Eppstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of deciding the truth of a statement in [[Presburger arithmetic]] requires even more time. Fischer and [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin]] proved in 1974 that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements has a runtime of at least &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{cn}}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''c''. Here, ''n'' is the length of the Presburger statement. Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the [[List of undecidable problems|undecidable problems]], such as the [[halting problem]]. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.

==Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete==

It was shown by Ladner that if P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladner75&quot; /&gt; Such problems are called [[NP-intermediate]] problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.

The [[graph isomorphism problem]] is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[Laszlo Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]] has run time 2&lt;sup&gt;O(√(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''))&lt;/sup&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices.

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes expected time O(e&lt;sup&gt;(64/9)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''.log 2)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;(log (''n''.log 2))&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to factor an ''n''-bit integer. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

==Does P mean &quot;easy&quot;?==

All of the above discussion has assumed that '''P''' means &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;not in '''P'''&quot; means &quot;hard&quot;. This assumption, known as ''[[Cobham's thesis]]'', though a common and reasonably accurate assumption in complexity theory, is not always true in practice; the size of constant factors or exponents may have practical importance, or there may be solutions that work for situations encountered in practice despite having poor worst-case performance in theory (this is the case for instance for the [[simplex algorithm]] in [[linear programming]]). Other solutions violate the Turing machine model on which '''P''' and '''NP''' are defined by introducing concepts like randomness and [[quantum computation]].

Because of these factors, even if a problem is shown to be NP-complete, and even if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''', there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the [[knapsack problem]], the [[travelling salesman problem]] and the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical [[average-case complexity]] (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low.

==Reasons to believe P ≠ NP==
According to a poll,&lt;ref name=&quot;poll&quot;/&gt; many computer scientists believe that '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known '''NP'''-complete problems (see [[List of NP-complete problems]]). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of '''NP'''-completeness was even defined ([[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]], among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result '''P''' = '''NP''' would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as '''NP''' = '''[[co-NP]]''' and '''P''' = [[PH (complexity)|'''PH''']].

It is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but for which the solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=122 |author=Scott Aaronson |title=Reasons to believe}}, point 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss...| [[Scott Aaronson]], [[MIT]]}}

On the other hand, some researchers believe that there is overconfidence in believing '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' and that researchers should explore proofs of '''P''' = '''NP''' as well. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:&lt;ref name=&quot;poll&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|The main argument in favor of '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''' is the total lack of fundamental progress in the area of exhaustive search. This is, in my opinion, a very weak argument.

[. . .] The resolution of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] also shows that very simple questions may be settled only by very deep theories.|[[Moshe Y. Vardi]], [[Rice University]]}}
{{quote|Being attached to a speculation is not a good guide to research planning. One should always try both directions of every problem. Prejudice has caused famous mathematicians to fail to solve famous problems whose solution was opposite to their expectations, even though they had developed all the methods required.|[[Anil Nerode]], [[Cornell University]]}}

==Consequences of proof==
One of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the answer. A proof that '''P''' = '''NP''' could have stunning practical consequences, if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in NP. It is also possible that a proof would not lead directly to efficient methods, perhaps if the proof is non-constructive, or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be efficient in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.

Cryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution to an NP-complete problem such as [[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] would break most existing cryptosystems including [[public-key cryptography]], a foundation for many modern security applications such as secure economic transactions over the Internet, and [[symmetric cipher]]s such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[Triple DES|3DES]], used for the encryption of communications data. These would need to be modified or replaced by [[information-theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] solutions.

On the other hand, there are enormous positive consequences that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in [[operations research]] are NP-complete, such as some types of [[integer programming]], and the [[travelling salesman problem]], to name two of the most famous examples. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for [[logistics]]. Many other important problems, such as some problems in [[protein structure prediction]], are also '''NP'''-complete;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Berger B, Leighton T |title=Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is NP-complete |journal=J. Comput. Biol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=27–40 |year=1998 |pmid=9541869 |doi=10.1089/cmb.1998.5.27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; if these problems were efficiently solvable it could spur considerable advances in biology.

But such changes may pale in significance compared to the revolution an efficient method for solving NP-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. According to [[Stephen Cook]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Problem Description&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|title=The P versus NP Problem|publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]]|year=2000|month=April|url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...it would transform mathematics by allowing a computer to find a formal proof of any theorem which has a proof of a reasonable length, since formal proofs can easily be recognized in polynomial time. Example problems may well include all of the [[Clay Math Institute#Millennium Prize Problems|CMI prize problems]].}}

Research mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated—for instance, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] took over three centuries to prove. A method that is guaranteed to find proofs to theorems, should one exist of a &quot;reasonable&quot; size, would essentially end this struggle.

A proof that showed that '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that '''P''' = '''NP''', but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in '''P''' ≠ '''NP''', much of this focusing of research has already taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Heuristic Problem-Solving Approach |author=L. R. Foulds |journal=The Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=34 |issue=10 |month=October | year=1983 |pages=927–934 |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2580891 |doi=10.2307/2580891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;not equal&quot; resolution to the P versus NP problem still leaves open the [[average-case complexity]] of hard problems in NP.  For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable.  [[Russell Impagliazzo]] has described five hypothetical &quot;worlds&quot; that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question.&lt;ref&gt;R. Impagliazzo, [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/average.ps &quot;A personal view of average-case complexity,&quot;] sct, pp.134, 10th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference (SCT'95), 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  These range from &quot;Algorithmica&quot;, where P=NP and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to &quot;Cryptomania&quot;, where P≠NP and generating hard instances of problems outside P is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of NP-hard problems.  The &quot;world&quot; where P≠NP but all problems in NP are tractable in the average case is called &quot;Heuristica&quot; in the paper.   A [[Princeton University]] workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2009/05/program-for-workshop-on-impagliazzos-worlds/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results about difficulty of proof==
Although the '''P''' = '''NP'''? problem itself remains open, despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques.  In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are not powerful enough to answer the question, thus suggesting that novel technical approaches are required.

As additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in [[computational complexity]] theory fall into one of the following classifications, each of which is known to be insufficient to prove that '''P''' ≠ '''NP''':
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Classification
!Definition
|-
|Relativizing proofs
|Imagine a world where every algorithm is allowed to make queries to some fixed subroutine called an [[oracle machine|oracle]], and the running time of the oracle is not counted against the running time of the algorithm. Most proofs (especially classical ones) apply uniformly in a world with oracles regardless of what the oracle does. These proofs are called ''relativizing''. In 1975, Baker, Gill, and [[Robert M. Solovay|Solovay]] showed that '''P''' = '''NP''' with respect to some oracles, while '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' for other oracles.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Baker, J. Gill, R. Solovay. ''Relativizations of the P =? NP Question''. [[SIAM Journal on Computing]], 4(4): 431–442 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Since relativizing proofs can only prove statements that are uniformly true with respect to all possible oracles, this showed that relativizing techniques cannot resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.
|-
|Natural proofs
|In 1993, [[Alexander Razborov]] and [[Steven Rudich]] defined a general class of proof techniques for circuit complexity lower bounds, called ''[[natural proof]]s''. At the time all previously known circuit lower bounds were natural, and circuit complexity was considered a very promising approach for resolving '''P''' = '''NP'''. However, Razborov and Rudich showed that, if [[one-way functions]] exist, then no natural proof method can distinguish between '''P''' and '''NP'''. Although one-way functions have never been formally proven to exist, most mathematicians believe that they do, and a proof or disproof of their existence would be a much stronger statement than the quantification of '''P''' relative to '''NP'''. Thus it is unlikely that natural proofs alone can resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.
|-
|Algebrizing proofs
|After the Baker-Gill-Solovay result, new non-relativizing proof techniques were successfully used to prove that [[IP (complexity)|IP]] = [[PSPACE]]. However, in 2008, [[Scott Aaronson]] and [[Avi Wigderson]] showed that the main technical tool used in the '''IP''' = '''PSPACE''' proof, known as ''arithmetization'', was also insufficient to resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Aaronson and A. Wigderson. Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory, in Proceedings of ACM STOC'2008, pp. 731–740.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These barriers are another reason why '''NP'''-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an '''NP'''-complete problem, this would solve the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem in a way not excluded by the above results.

These barriers have also led some computer scientists to suggest that the P versus NP problem may be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of standard axiom systems like [[ZFC]] (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it's impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf|first=Scott|last=Aaronson|authorlink=Scott Aaronson|title=Is P Versus NP Formally Independent?|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the [[Peano axioms]] (PA) for integer arithmetic, then
there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=On the independence of P versus NP|first1=Shai|last1=Ben-David|first2=Shai|last2=Halevi|series=Technical Report|volume=714|publisher=Technion|year=1992|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shai/ph.ps.gz|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in NP.

==Logical characterizations==
The '''P''' = '''NP''' problem can be restated in terms of expressible certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in [[descriptive complexity]]. All languages (of finite structures with a fixed [[signature (logic)|signature]] including a [[linear order]] relation) in '''P''' can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] with the addition of a suitable least [[fixed point combinator]] (effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions); indeed, (as long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation [so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure]), this precisely characterizes '''P'''. Similarly, '''NP''' is the set of languages expressible in existential [[second-order logic]]—that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude [[universal quantification]] over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the [[polynomial hierarchy]], '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]''', correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question &quot;is '''P''' a proper subset of '''NP'''&quot; can be reformulated as &quot;is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?&quot;. The word &quot;existential&quot; can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since '''P''' = '''NP''' if and only if '''P''' = '''PH''' (as the former would establish that '''NP''' = '''co-NP''', which in turn implies that '''NP''' = '''PH'''). [[PSPACE]] = [[NPSPACE]] as established [[Savitch's theorem]], this follows directly from the fact that the square of a polynomial function is still a polynomial function. However, it is believed, but not proven, a similar relationship may not exist between the polynomial time complexity classes, [[P (complexity)|P]] and [[NP (complexity)|NP]] so the question is still open.

==Polynomial-time algorithms==
No algorithm for any '''NP'''-complete problem is known to run in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms for '''NP'''-complete problems with the property that if '''P''' = '''NP''', then the algorithm runs in polynomial time (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). The following algorithm, due to [[Leonid Levin|Levin]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} is such an example. It correctly accepts the '''NP'''-complete language [[subset sum problem|SUBSET-SUM]], and runs in polynomial time if and only if '''P''' = '''NP''':

 // Algorithm that accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM.
 //
 // This is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if '''P'''='''NP'''.
 //
 // &quot;Polynomial-time&quot; means it returns &quot;yes&quot; in polynomial time when
 // the answer should be &quot;yes&quot;, and runs forever when it is &quot;no&quot;.
 //
 // Input: S = a finite set of integers
 // Output: &quot;yes&quot; if any subset of S adds up to 0.
 // Runs forever with no output otherwise.
 // Note: &quot;Program number P&quot; is the program obtained by
 // writing the integer P in binary, then
 // considering that string of bits to be a
 // program. Every possible program can be
 // generated this way, though most do nothing
 // because of syntax errors.&lt;br /&gt;
 FOR N = 1...infinity
   FOR P = 1...N
     Run program number P for N steps with input S
     IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers
       AND the integers are all in S
       AND the integers sum to 0&lt;br /&gt;
     THEN
       OUTPUT &quot;yes&quot; and HALT

If, and only if, '''P''' = '''NP''', then this is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an '''NP'''-complete language. &quot;Accepting&quot; means it gives &quot;yes&quot; answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is &quot;no&quot;.

This algorithm is enormously impractical, even if '''P''' = '''NP'''. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is ''b'' bits long, the above algorithm will try at least 2&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;−1 other programs first.

==Formal definitions for P and NP==
Conceptually a ''decision problem'' is a problem that takes as input some [[String (computer science)|string]] ''w'' over an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and outputs &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If there is an [[algorithm]] (say a [[Turing machine]], or a [[Computer programming|computer program]] with unbounded memory) that can produce the correct answer for any input string of length ''n'' in at most &lt;math&gt;c \cdot n^k + c&lt;/math&gt; steps, where ''k'' and ''c'' are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in ''polynomial time'' and we place it in the class '''P'''. Formally, '''P''' is defined as the set of all languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. That is,

'''P''' = &lt;math&gt;\{ L : L=L(M) \text{ for some deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine } M \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(M) = \{ w\in\Sigma^{*}: M \text{ accepts } w \}&lt;/math&gt;

and a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' that satisfies the following two conditions:

# &lt;math&gt;M \text{ halts on all input } w&lt;/math&gt;; and
# there exists &lt;math&gt;k \in N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T_M(n)\in O(n^{k})&lt;/math&gt; (where O refers to the [[Big O notation#Formal definition|big O notation]]),
::where &lt;math&gt;T_M(n) = \max\{ t_M(w) : w\in\Sigma^{*}, \left|w\right| = n \}&lt;/math&gt;
::and &lt;math&gt;t_M(w) = \text{ number of steps }M\text{ takes to halt on input }w.&lt;/math&gt;

'''NP''' can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach to define '''NP''' is to use the concept of ''[[Certificate (complexity)|certificate]]'' and ''verifier''. Formally, '''NP''' is defined as the set of languages over a finite alphabet that have a verifier that runs in polynomial time, where the notion of &quot;verifier&quot; is defined as follows.

Let ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbf{NP}&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, there exists a binary relation &lt;math&gt;R\subset\Sigma^{*}\times\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and a positive integer ''k'' such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

# For all &lt;math&gt;x\in\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in L \Leftrightarrow\exists y\in\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left|y\right|\in O(\left|x\right|^{k})&lt;/math&gt;; and
# the language &lt;math&gt;L_{R} = \{ x\# y:(x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\cup\{\#\}&lt;/math&gt; is decidable by a Turing machine in polynomial time.

A Turing machine that decides &lt;math&gt;L_{R}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''verifier'' for ''L'' and a ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''certificate of membership'' of ''x'' in ''L''.

In general, a verifier does not have to be polynomial-time. However, for ''L'' to be in '''NP''', there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.

===Example===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathit{COMPOSITE} = \{x\in\mathbb N:x=pq \;\text{for integers}\; p, q &gt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb N\times\mathbb N: 1&lt;y \leq \sqrt x\; ; \;y\; \text{divides}\; x\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, the question of whether a given ''x'' is a [[Composite number|composite]] is equivalent to the question of whether ''x'' is a member of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{COMPOSITE}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\mathit{COMPOSITE}\in\mathbf{NP}&lt;/math&gt; by verifying that &lt;math&gt;\mathit{COMPOSITE}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{COMPOSITE}&lt;/math&gt; also happens to be in '''P'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agrawal&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=M. Agrawal, N. Kayal, N. Saxena|title=Primes is in P|url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[AKS primality test]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition for NP-completeness==
There are many equivalent ways of describing '''NP'''-completeness.

Let &lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt; be a language over a finite alphabet &lt;math&gt;\ \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt; is '''NP'''-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:

# &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbf{NP}&lt;/math&gt;; and
# any &lt;math&gt;L^{'}\in\mathbf{NP}&lt;/math&gt; is polynomial-time-reducible to &lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt; (written as &lt;math&gt;L^{'}\leq_{p} L&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;L^{'}\leq_{p} L&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:
## There exists &lt;math&gt;f : \Sigma^{*}\rightarrow\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
\forall w\in\Sigma^{*}(w\in L^{'}\Leftrightarrow f(w)\in L)&lt;/math&gt;; and
## there exists a polynomial-time Turing machine that halts with &lt;math&gt;\ f(w)&lt;/math&gt; on its tape on any input &lt;math&gt;\ w&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Charles Sanders Peirce''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|p|ɜr|s}} like &quot;purse&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Peirce&quot;, in the case of C.S. Peirce, always rhymes with the English-language word &quot;terse&quot; and so, in most dialects, is pronounced exactly like the English-language word &quot;purse&quot;: {{audio|en-us-purse.ogg|Audio (US)}}. See &quot;[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/news/1_3/13_4x.htm#pronunciation Note on the Pronunciation of 'Peirce']&quot;, ''Peirce Project Newsletter'', v. 1, nos. 3/4, Dec. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
September 10, 1839 – April 19, 1914) was an [[American philosopher]], [[logic]]ian, [[mathematics|mathematician]], and [[science|scientist]], born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Peirce was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, and [[semiotics]], and for his founding of [[pragmatism]]. In 1934, the philosopher [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]] called Peirce &quot;the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logician&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Weiss, Paul]] (1934), &quot;Peirce, Charles Sanders&quot; in the ''Dictionary of American Biography''. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/weissbio.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

An innovator in mathematics, [[statistics]], philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself a [[logic]]ian first and foremost. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of [[semiotics]], of which he is a founder. As early as 1886 he saw that [[logic gate|logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits]], the same idea as was used decades later to produce digital computers.&lt;ref name=P2M&gt;Peirce, C.

==Life==
[[Image:Charles Peirce birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Peirce's birthplace near Harvard Yard.]]
Charles Sanders Peirce was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and [[Benjamin Peirce]], himself a professor of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Harvard University]], perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America. At 12 years of age, Charles read an older brother's copy of [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Logic'', then the leading English-language text on the subject. Thus began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max, &quot;[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v1/v1intro.htm Introduction]&quot;, W 1:xvii, find phrase &quot;One episode&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to obtain the BA and MA from Harvard; in 1863 the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] awarded him a B.Sc. that was Harvard's first ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/span&gt;'' [[chemistry]] degree;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Peirce, Charles Sanders&quot; (1898), ''The National Cyclopedia of American Biography'', v. 8, [http://books.google.com/books?id=1uI-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=%22Peirce%2C%20Charles%22 p. 409].&lt;/ref&gt; and otherwise his academic record was undistinguished (B:54–6). At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Chauncey Wright]], and [[William James]] (B:363–4). One of his Harvard instructors, [[Charles William Eliot]], formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Harvard's employing Peirce in any capacity (B:19-20, 53, 75, 245).

Peirce suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous facial condition then known as &quot;facial neuralgia&quot;, which would today be diagnosed as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. Brent says that when in the throes of its pain &quot;he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper&quot; (B:40). Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic.

===United States Coast Survey===
[[image:ProperfrontPM.JPG|thumb|left|'''[[Peirce Geodetic Monument]]''']] Between 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]],&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), &quot;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]&quot;, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection (B:139) until the latter's death in 1880. That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the [[Boston Brahmin]] Peirces sympathized with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] (B:61-2). At the Survey, he worked mainly in [[geodesy]] and [[gravimetry]], refining the use of [[pendulum]]s to determine small local variations in the strength of [[Earth]]'s [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt;  He was elected a resident fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in January 1867 (B:69). The Survey sent him to Europe five times (B:368), first in 1871, as part of a group sent to observe a [[solar eclipse]]; while there, he sought out [[Augustus De Morgan]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] (B:79-81), British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of [[star]]s and the shape of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=SP2&gt;Moore, Edward C., and Robin, Richard S., eds., (1964), ''Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series'', Amherst: U. of Massachusetts Press. On Peirce the astronomer, see Lenzen's chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1877 he was elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (B:367). Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the [[meter]] as so many [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] of a certain [[frequency]],&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max (1983), &quot;Peirce as Scientist, Mathematician, Historian, Logician, and Philosopher&quot;, ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (new edition), see p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; the kind of definition employed [[Metre#Standard wavelength of krypton-86 emission|from 1960 to 1983]].

During the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic ''[[Century Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep Peirce Edition Project (UQÀM) - in short]&quot; from [[#PEP|PEP-UQÀM]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, an investigation by the [[William B. Allison|Allison]] Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent [[Julius Hilgard]] and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Nathan, &quot;[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v5/v5intro.htm Introduction]&quot;, W 5:xxviii-xxix, find &quot;Allison&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]]'s request (B:202). He never again held regular employment.

===Johns Hopkins University===
In 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at the new [[Johns Hopkins University]], which was strong in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy ([[Josiah Royce|Royce]] and [[John Dewey|Dewey]] did their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by [[G. Stanley Hall]] and studied by [[Joseph Jastrow]], who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by [[J. J. Sylvester]], who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). &lt;span id=GS&gt;1883&lt;/span&gt; saw publication of his &lt;span id=SIL&gt;''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University]]''&lt;/span&gt; containing works by himself and [[Allan Marquand]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin|Christine Ladd]], [[Benjamin Ives Gilman]], and [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]]. They were among his graduate students.&lt;ref name=grads&gt;Houser, Nathan (1989), &quot;[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v4/v4intro.htm Introduction]&quot;, W 4:xxxviii, find &quot;Eighty-nine&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This nontenured position proved to be the only academic appointment Peirce ever held.

Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major American scientist of the day, [[Simon Newcomb]] (B:150–4, 195, 279–80, 289). Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by a difficult personality; Brent conjectures as to further psychological difficulty (B:xv).

Peirce's personal life also handicapped him. His first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (&quot;Zina&quot;), left him in 1875 (B:98–101). He soon took up with a woman, [[Juliette Peirce|Juliette]], whose maiden name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai (B:141) and nationality (she spoke French, B:148) remain uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Nathan, &quot;[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v6/v6intro.htm Introduction]&quot;, W 6, first paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; but his divorce from Zina became final only in 1883, whereupon he married Juliette (B:123, 368). That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884 (B:150–1, 368). Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success.&lt;ref&gt;In 1885 (B:369); in 1890 and 1900 (B:215, 273); in 1891 (B:215–16); and in 1892 (B:151–2, 222).&lt;/ref&gt; He had no children by either marriage (B:77).

===Poverty===
[[image:Milford and NYC and Cambridge.GIF|frame|Cambridge, where Peirce was born and raised, New York City, where he often visited and sometimes lived, and Milford, where he spent the later years of his life with his second wife Juliette.]] [[image:JulietteAndCharles.JPG|frame|Juliette and Charles by the well at their home, Arisbe, in 1907.]] In 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of rural land near [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], which never yielded an economic return.&lt;ref&gt;B:191-2, 217, 270, 318, 321, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; There he had a 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design (B:13). The Peirces named the property &quot;[[Juliette Peirce#Arisbe|Arisbe]]&quot;. There they lived with a few interruptions for the rest of their lives (B:369–74), Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see [[#Works|Works]]). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties (B:191). He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the [[verso]] side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while (B:246). Several people, including his brother [[James Mills Peirce]] (B:242) and his neighbors, relatives of [[Gifford Pinchot]], settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage (B:271).

Peirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' (with whose editor, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]], he became friendly). He did translations for the [[Smithsonian Institution]], at its director [[Samuel Langley]]'s instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing (B:249–55). He began but did not complete a number of books (B:371). In 1888, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed him to the [[Assay Commission]] (B:189). From 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge [[Francis C. Russell]] of Chicago (B:370), who introduced Peirce to editor [[Paul Carus]] and owner [[Open Court Publishing Company|Edward Hegeler]] of the pioneering American philosophy journal ''[[The Monist]]'', which eventually published articles by Peirce (B:205–6), at least 14. He applied to the newly formed [[Carnegie Institution]] for a grant to write a systematic book of his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis Newcomb served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal (B:279–89).

The one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend [[William James]], dedicating his ''Will to Believe'' (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903) (B:261–4, 290–2, 324). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him (B:306–7 &amp; 315–6). It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used &quot;Santiago&quot; (&quot;St. James&quot; in Spanish) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See [[Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce]] for discussion and references).

Peirce died destitute in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], twenty years before his widow.

==Reception==
[[Bertrand Russell]] (1959) wrote,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1959), ''Wisdom of the West'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century, and certainly the greatest American thinker ever.&quot; (His ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' does not mention Peirce; Peirce's work was not widely known till later.&lt;ref name=Anellis&gt;Anellis, Irving H. (1995), &quot;Peirce Rustled, Russell Pierced: How Charles Peirce and Bertrand Russell Viewed Each Other's Work in Logic, and an Assessment of Russell's Accuracy and Role in the Historiography of Logic&quot;, ''Modern Logic'' 5, 270–328. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/anellis/csp&amp;br.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;) [[A. N. Whitehead]], while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own &quot;process&quot; thinking. (On Peirce and [[process metaphysics]], see Lowe 1964.&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt;) [[Karl Popper]] viewed Peirce as &quot;one of the greatest philosophers of all times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (1972), ''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]&lt;ref&gt;See Royce, Josiah, and Kernan, W. Fergus (1916), &quot;Charles Sanders Peirce&quot;, ''The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method'' v. 13, pp. 701–9. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/royce/cspobit.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; admired him, and [[Cassius Jackson Keyser]] at Columbia and [[C. K. Ogden]] wrote about Peirce with respect, but to no immediate effect.

The first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], the editor of a 1923 anthology of Peirce's writings titled ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love, and Logic]]'' and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings.&lt;ref&gt;Ketner ''et al.'' (1986), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#cb|Comprehensive Bibliography]]'', see p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dewey]] studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins&lt;ref name=grads/&gt; and, from 1916 onwards, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' is much influenced by Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Hookway, Christopher (2008), &quot;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/ Pragmatism]&quot;, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the first six volumes of the ''Collected Papers'' (1931–35), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds (B:8) did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and [[T. A. Goudge|Goudge]] (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by [[Arthur W. Burks]] (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The [[#CSPS|Charles S. Peirce Society]] was founded in 1946. Its ''Transactions'', an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965.

In 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics [[Carolyn Eisele]] (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her 40 years of research on Peirce the mathematician and scientist, culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]] [[Max Fisch]] (1900–1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce; Fisch (1986)&lt;ref name=Fisch&gt;Fisch, Max (1986), ''Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism'', Kenneth Laine Ketner and Christian J. W. Kloesel, eds., Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana U. Pr.&lt;/ref&gt; includes many of his relevant articles, including a wide-ranging survey (Fisch 1986: 422–48) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.

Peirce has gained a significant international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and [[pragmatism]] in Brazil ([[#CIEP|CeneP/CIEP]]), Finland ([[#CDPT|HPRC, including Commens]]), Germany ([[#IRGAI|Wirth's group]], [[#RGSEME|Hoffman's and Otte's group]], and Deuser's and Härle's group&lt;ref&gt;Theological Research Group in C.S. Peirce's Philosophy (&lt;span lang=de&gt;Hermann Deuser, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen; Wilfred Härle, Philipps-Universität Marburg&lt;/span&gt;, Germany).&lt;/ref&gt;), France ([[#LIRSCE|L'I.R.S.C.E.]]), Spain ([[#GEP|GEP]]), and Italy ([[#CSPI|CSP]]). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirceans of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the [[University of Toronto]]'s, thanks in good part to the leadership of [[T. A. Goudge|Thomas Goudge]] and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at [[IUPUI|Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis]], home of the [[#PEP|Peirce Edition Project]] (PEP), and the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

{{quote|Currently, considerable interest is being taken in Peirce's ideas by researchers wholly outside the arena of academic philosophy. The interest comes from industry, business, technology, intelligence organizations, and the military; and it has resulted in the existence of a substantial number of agencies, institutes, businesses, and laboratories in which ongoing research into and development of Peircean concepts are being vigorously undertaken.|Robert Burch, 2001, updated 2010&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt;}}

==Works==
Peirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as ''Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'', the ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', ''[[The Monist]]'', ''[[Popular Science]] Monthly'', the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', ''Memoirs of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and others. See [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime|Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime]] for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Burks|Burks, Arthur]], Introduction, CP 7, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; was ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PR|Photometric Researches]]'' (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (1883), containing chapters by himself and his [[#GS|graduate students]]. Besides lectures during his years (1879–1884) as Lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Lectures by Peirce|Lectures by Peirce]].

[[Harvard University]] bought from Peirce's widow soon after his death the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Robin, Richard S. (1967), ''[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/robin/robin.htm Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of Charles S. Peirce]''. Amherst MA: University of Massachusetts Press.&lt;/ref&gt; catalogued this ''[[Nachlass]]'' did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000 pages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The manuscript material now (1997) comes to more than a hundred thousand pages. These contain many pages of no philosophical interest, but the number of pages on philosophy certainly number much more than half of that. Also, a significant but unknown number of manuscripts have been lost.&quot; — Joseph Ransdell (1997), &quot;Some Leading Ideas of Peirce's Semiotic&quot;, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/ransdell/leading.htm#note2 end note 2], 1997 light revision of 1977 version in ''Semiotica'' 19:157–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of it remains unpublished, except [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#mf|on microfilm]].

The first published anthology of Peirce's articles was the one-volume ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays]]'', edited by [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], 1923, still in print. [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Other collections|Other one-volume anthologies]] were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions&lt;ref&gt;See for example &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/collections.html Collections of Peirce's Writings]&quot; at ''Commens'', U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; of Peirce's works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:

&lt;span id=CP&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1931–58: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce's work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce's development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors' notes.&lt;ref&gt;See 1987 review by B.

==Mathematics==
[[Image:Peirce-quincuncial-bright-lines.gif|thumb|The [[Peirce quincuncial projection]] of a sphere [[conformal map|keeps angles true]] except at several isolated points and results in less distortion of area than in other projections.]]Peirce's most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on [[linear algebra]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], various geometries, [[topology]] and [[Listing number]]s, [[Bell number]]s, [[Graph theory|graph]]s, the [[four-color problem]], and the nature of continuity. 

He worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections (such as the [[Peirce quincuncial projection]]), and was especially active in [[probability]] and [[statistics]].&lt;ref name=Burks&gt;[[Arthur W.

;Discoveries

Peirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:

In 1860&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1860 MS), &quot;Orders of Infinity&quot;, [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/PEP_news_Sept2010.pdf ''News from the Peirce Edition Project'', September 2010] (PDF), p. 6, with the manuscript's text.

In 1880–81&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (MS, winter of 1880–81), &quot;A Boolean Algebra with One Constant&quot;, CP 4.12–20, W 4:218-21.

Peirce'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; he showed how [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could be done via a [[Functional completeness|repeated sufficient single binary operation]] ([[logical NOR]]), anticipating [[Henry M. Sheffer]] by 33 years. (See also [[De Morgan's Laws]]).

In 1881&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1881), &quot;On the Logic of Number&quot;, ''American Journal of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=LQgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85 85]-95.

Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; he set out the [[Peano axioms|axiomatization of natural number arithmetic]], a few years before [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]]. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as &quot;[[Dedekind-finite]]&quot;, and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an [[infinite set]] (Dedekind-infinite), as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that can be put into a [[one-to-one correspondence]] with one of its proper [[subsets]].

In 1886 he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches,&lt;ref name=P2M/&gt; anticipating [[Claude Shannon]] by more than 50 years. [[Image:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg|thumb|300px|[[Existential graph]]s: Alpha graphs]]

Based on them are [[John F. Sowa]]'s [[conceptual graph]]s and Sun-Joo Shin's [[diagrammatic reasoning]].

;''The New Elements of Mathematics''

Peirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title ''The New Elements of Mathematics'', that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared&lt;ref name=Burks /&gt; in ''The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce'' (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele.

;Nature of mathematics

Peirce agreed with [[Auguste Comte]] in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|classified]] mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the [[real numbers]]) and continua. Influenced by his father [[Benjamin Peirce|Benjamin]], Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science ''about'' drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1898), &quot;The Logic of Mathematics in Relation to Education&quot; in ''Educational Review'' v. 15, pp. [http://www.archive.org/stream/educationalrevie15newyuoft#page/209/mode/1up 209–16] (via ''Internet Archive''). Reprinted CP 3.553–62. See also his &quot;The Simplest Mathematics&quot; (1902 MS), CP 4.227–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics of logic===

&lt;/div&gt; Beginning with his first paper on the [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#LOR1870|&quot;Logic of Relatives&quot; (1870)]], Peirce extended the [[theory of relations]] that [[Augustus De Morgan]] had just recently awakened from its Cinderella slumbers. Much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was &quot;borrowed&quot; from Peirce, not always with all due credit; on that and on how the young [[Bertrand Russell]], especially his ''Principles of Mathematics'' and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995).&lt;ref name=Anellis/&gt; In 1918 the logician [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C.&amp;nbsp;I. Lewis]] wrote, &quot;The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer — at least in the nineteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Clarence Irving (1918), ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'', see ch. 1, §7 &quot;Peirce&quot;, pp. 79–106, see [http://www.archive.org/stream/surveyofsymbolic00lewiiala#page/79/mode/1up p. 79] (''Internet Archive''). Note that Lewis's bibliography lists works by Frege, tagged with asterisks as important.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1940, [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of [[relational algebra]].

Relational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of [[E. H. Moore]] and the [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] of [[Garrett Birkhoff]]. In computer science, the [[relational model]] for [[database]]s was developed with Peircean ideas in work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who was a doctoral student&lt;ref&gt;Avery, John (2003) ''Information theory and evolution'', p. 167; also Mitchell, Melanie, &quot;[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/MMScientificAncestry.html My Scientific Ancestry]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Arthur W. Burks]], a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[John von Neumann]], and [[Paul Samuelson]] to study preferences and utility and by [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] in ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'', following Arrow's association with Tarski at [[City College of New York]].

On Peirce and his contemporaries [[Ernst Schröder]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Hilary Putnam]] (1982)&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;Putnam, Hilary (1982), &quot;Peirce the Logician&quot;, ''Historia Mathematica'' 9, 290–301. Reprinted, pp. 252–60 in Putnam (1990), ''Realism with a Human Face'', Harvard. [http://www.jfsowa.com/peirce/putnam.htm Excerpt with article's last five pages].&lt;/ref&gt; documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]]. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's &quot;On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation&quot;&lt;ref name=CSP1885/&gt; (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by [[Peano]] and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, [[philosophy of language]], and the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Peirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides [[Ernst Schröder]]:
*Philosophical algebraist [[William Kingdon Clifford]]&lt;ref&gt;Beil, Ralph G. and Ketner, Kenneth (2003), &quot;Peirce, Clifford, and Quantum Theory&quot;, ''International Journal of Theoretical Physics'' v. 42, n. 9, pp. 1957-1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and logician [[William Ernest Johnson]], both British;
*The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including [[Alfred Tarski]];
*[[Arthur Prior]], who praised and studied Peirce's logical work in a 1964 paper&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt; and in ''Formal Logic'' (saying on page 4 that Peirce &quot;perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since.&quot;).

S. Peirce in the History of Logical Theory&quot; in Brunning and Forster (1997), ''The Rule of Reason: The Philosophy of C. S. Peirce'', U. of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; and Geraldine Brady (2000)&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt; divide those who study formal (and natural) languages into two camps: the [[model theory|model-theorists]] / [[semantics|semanticists]], and the [[proof theory|proof theorists]] / universalists. Hintikka and Brady view Peirce as a pioneer model theorist.

A philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982);&lt;ref name=Putnam /&gt; the Introduction in Nathan Houser ''et al.'' (1997);&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Roberts, and Van Evra, eds.

===Continua===
Continuity and [[synechism]] are central in Peirce's philosophy. He embraced [[infinitesimal]]s and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903 MS), CP 6.176: &quot;But I now define a ''pseudo-continuum'' as that which modern writers on the theory of functions call a ''continuum''. But this is fully represented by [...] the totality of real values, rational and irrational [...].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of ''analysis situs'' ([[topology]]); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any [[Aleph number]] (any infinite ''multitude'' as he called it) of instants.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902 MS) and [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Ransdell, Joseph]], ed. (1998), &quot;Analysis of the Methods of Mathematical Demonstration&quot;, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm#m4 Memoir 4], Draft C, MS L75.90–102, see 99–100. (Once there, scroll down).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. Jérôme Havenel (2008): &quot;It is on May 26, 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Probability and statistics===
Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see [[Tychism]] on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce condemned the use of &quot;certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]&quot; (EP 2:108–9) even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used a bit of [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology (W 6:76).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his [[possible world semantics]] introduced the [[propensity probability|&quot;propensity&quot; theory of probability]] before [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Richard W. (1975), &quot;Propensity: Popper or Peirce?&quot;, ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'' ([http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org site]), v. 26, n. 2, pp. 123–32. {{doi|10.1093/bjps/26.2.123}}.

Peirce was one of the [[founders of statistics]]. He formulated modern statistics in &quot;[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]&quot; (1877–8) and &quot;[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]&quot; (1883). With a [[repeated measures design]], he introduced [[Blind experiment|blinded]], [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled randomized experiments]] in 1884 (Hacking 1990:205)&lt;ref name=Hacking/&gt; (before [[Ronald A. Fisher]]).&lt;ref name=Stigler78/&gt; He invented [[optimal design]] for experiments on gravity, in which he &quot;[[analysis of variance|corrected the means]]&quot;. He used [[logistic regression]], [[correlation]], and [[smoothing]]. Peirce extended the work on [[Peirce's criterion|outliers]] by [[Benjamin Peirce]], his father.&lt;ref name=Stigler78/&gt; He introduced terms &quot;[[Confidence interval|confidence]]&quot; and &quot;[[Likelihood function|likelihood]]&quot; (before [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). (See [[Stephen Stigler]]'s historical books and [[Ian Hacking]] 1990&lt;ref name=Hacking/&gt;).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|It is not sufficiently recognized that Peirce’s career was that of a scientist, not a philosopher; and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist, only secondarily as a logician, and scarcely at all as a philosopher. Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircean studies.|Max Fisch 1964, p. 486.&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt;}}

Peirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of [[Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], [[statistics]], [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt; [[metrology]],&lt;ref name=metr/&gt; [[geodesy]], [[experimental psychology]],&lt;ref name=psych/&gt; [[economics]],&lt;ref name=econom/&gt; [[linguistics]],&lt;ref name=ling/&gt; and the [[history and philosophy of science]]. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.

Peirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion ([[fallibilism]]) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways—including philosophical [[pragmatism]] (which he founded), [[#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]], and [[scientific method]]—and, in metaphysics: [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], belief in God, feedom, and immortality, [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love. In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like [[skepticism]] and [[positivism]], respectively, in others' work. However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skepticism]] and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,&lt;ref name=FCE&gt;Peirce (1897) &quot;Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution&quot;, CP 1.141–75 ([http://www.textlog.de/4248.html Eprint]), placed by the CP editors directly after &quot;F.R.L.&quot; (1899, CP 1.135–40).&lt;/ref&gt; and pragmatism commits one to anti-[[nominalist]] belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–7).

For Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;Peirce (1903), CP 1.180-202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] and (1906) &quot;The Basis of Pragmaticism&quot;, EP 2:372–3, see &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]&quot; at CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.

===Theory of categories===
{{Main|Categories (Peirce)}}

On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled &quot;[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm On a New List of Categories]&quot; to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories which Peirce developed in response to reading [[Aristotle]], [[Kant]], and [[Hegel]], categories which Peirce applied throughout philosophy and elsewhere for the rest of his life. Most students of Peirce will readily agree on their prevalence in his philosophical work. Peirce scholars generally regard the &quot;New List&quot; as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's &quot;architectonic&quot;, his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern which one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in &quot;[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How To Make Our Ideas Clear]]&quot; (1878 foundational paper for pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.

===Esthetics and ethics===
Peirce did not write extensively in esthetics and ethics,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://agora.phi.gvsu.edu/kap/CSP_Bibliography/CSP_norm_bib.pdf Charles S. Peirce on Esthetics and Ethics: A Bibliography]&quot; (PDF) by Kelly A. Parker in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but came by 1902 to hold that esthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902 MS), Carnegie Application, edited by Joseph Ransdell, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Memoir 2], see table.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined esthetics as the study of good and bad, and thus of the ends governing all conduct.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/esthetics.html Esthetics] at CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy: Logic, or semiotic==
{{Semiotics}}

===Logic as philosophical===
Peirce regarded logic ''per se'' as a division of philosophy, as a normative science after esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref name=FRL&gt;Peirce (1899 MS), &quot;F.R.L.&quot; [First Rule of Logic], CP 1.135–40, [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;the art of devising methods of research&quot;.&lt;ref name=ars&gt;Peirce (1882), &quot;Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic&quot; delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 11]–12 (via Google), November 1882. Reprinted (EP 1:210–14; W 4:378–82; CP 7.59–76). The definition of logic quoted by Peirce is by [[Peter of Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, as inference, &quot;logic is rooted in the social principle&quot;, since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1878), &quot;The Doctrine of Chances&quot;, ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–15 (CP 2.645–68, W 3:276–90, EP 1:142–54). {{quote|...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall ''not'' be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) &quot;mathematics of logic&quot; much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply &quot;logic&quot;. He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.

Peirce argued that [[#fs|logic is formal semiotic]], the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that &quot;all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, CP 5.448 footnote, from &quot;The Basis of Pragmaticism&quot; in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs&lt;ref name=QFM&gt;Peirce, (1868), &quot;Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man&quot;, ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 2, [http://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA103 pp. 103]-14. On thought in signs, see p. 112. Reprinted CP 5.213-63 (on thought in signs, see 253), W 2:193-211, EP 2:11-27. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes (&quot;semiosis&quot;) such as the inquiry process. He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.

====Presuppositions of logic====
In his &quot;F.R.L.&quot; [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and &quot;in one sense, this sole&quot;, rule of reason is that, ''to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRL&quot;/&gt; So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:
:...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:
&lt;center&gt;Do not block the way of inquiry.&lt;/center&gt;
Peirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that &quot;the one unpardonable offence&quot; is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which &quot;metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted&quot;. Peirce in many writings holds that [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|logic precedes metaphysics]] (ontological, religious, and physical).

Peirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and [[synechism]]).&lt;ref name=FCE/&gt;

The First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough ([[#defs|see below]]). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361-2, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm#m10 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

#No power of introspection. All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.
#No power of intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.
#No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.
#No conception of the absolutely incognizable.
(The above sense of the term &quot;intuition&quot; is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)

Peirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning,&lt;ref name=GVLL/&gt; and the falsity of philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]] ([[#Against Cartesianism|see below]]).

Peirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt; and later said that to &quot;dismiss make-believes&quot; is a prerequisite for pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), &quot;What Pragmatism Is&quot;, ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, pp. 161-81, [http://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 see 167]. Reprinted CP 5.411-37, see 416. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/whatis/whatpragis.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logic as formal semiotic====
Peirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, in such ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;loci&lt;/span&gt;'' as: the basic terminology of [[psychology]] in ''[[On the Soul]]''; the founding description of [[sign relation]]s in ''[[On Interpretation]]''; and the differentiation of [[inference]] into three modes that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', as well as inference by [[analogy]] (called ''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;paradeigma&lt;/span&gt;'' by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.

Peirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both ''[[semiotic]]'' and ''[[semeiotic]]''. Both are current in singular and plural.&lt;ref&gt;On the evolution of the word &quot;semiotic&quot;, see [[Semeiotic#Literature]].&lt;/ref&gt; He based it on the conception of a triadic [[sign relation]], and defined ''[[semiosis]]'' as &quot;action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce 1907, CP 5.484. Reprinted, EP 2:411 in &quot;Pragmatism&quot; (398–433).&lt;/ref&gt; As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse:

{{quote|To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.|Peirce 1868.&lt;ref name=QFM/&gt;}}
Peirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where 'sign' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or ''quasi-mind'', that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]&quot; in CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt; — the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued). 

Inquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:

#Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.
#Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.
#Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

&lt;span id=fs&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Peirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:

{{quote|''On the Definition of Logic''. Logic is ''formal semiotic''. A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word &quot;formal&quot; in the definition is also defined. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; —Peirce, &quot;Carnegie Application&quot;, ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, p. 54.}}

===Signs===
{{Main|Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)}} {{See also|Representation (arts)#Peirce and representation|Sign (semiotics)#Triadic signs}}
A list of noted writings by Peirce on signs and sign relations is at [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#References and further reading]].

====Sign relation====
Anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.

''Extension × intension = information.'' Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1867), &quot;Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension&quot; (CP 2.391–426), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm W 2:70–86]).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.

''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience&lt;ref name=collateral&gt;See pp. 404–9 in &quot;Pragmatism&quot; in EP 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive. Note: Ransdell's quotes from CP 8.178–9 are also in EP 2:493–4, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from CP 8.183 is also in EP 2:495–6, which gives its date as 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word &quot;determine&quot; not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of &quot;specializes,&quot; ''&lt;span lang=de&gt;bestimmt&lt;/span&gt;'',&lt;ref name=determined&gt;Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see EP 2:492.&lt;/ref&gt; involving variable amount, like an influence.&lt;ref name=Marty&gt;See &quot;[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/76defeng.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]&quot;, collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'', pp. 80–1: {{quote|I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of &quot;upon a person&quot; is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref name=Marty/&gt;

====Semiotic elements====
Peirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):
#A ''sign'' (or ''representamen''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Representamen&quot;, properly with the 'a' long and stressed ({{IPAc-en|r|ɛ|p|r|ə|z|ɛ|n|.|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ən}} {{respell|rep-rə-zen|TAY|mən}}), was adopted ([[wikt:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his technical term for the ''sign'' as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word &quot;sign&quot;. He eventually stopped using &quot;representamen&quot;. See EP 2:272–3 and ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'' p. 193, quotes in &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]&quot; at CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt;) represents, in the broadest possible sense of &quot;represents&quot;. It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial. As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined ''sign'' at least 76 times&lt;ref name=Marty/&gt;), the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant.
#An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet]].&lt;ref name=fictive&gt;Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, EP 2:492-502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]&quot; at CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt; All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.&lt;ref name=fictive/&gt; For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded &quot;as on bedrock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Immediate Object&quot;, etc., at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt;
#An ''[[interpretant]]'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's &quot;predecessor&quot; (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a ''final'' or ''normal'' interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign ''would'' have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.
Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref name=collateral/&gt;

====Classes of signs====

Among Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.&lt;ref name=9signs/&gt;

I. ''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''&lt;ref name=terms&gt;On the varying terminology, look up in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt;): This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a &quot;First&quot;; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a &quot;Second&quot;; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a &quot;Third&quot;.

II. ''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.

III. ''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,''&lt;ref name=terms/&gt; and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}} 
Every sign belongs to one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

===Modes of inference===
{{Main|Inquiry}}
Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of inference in inquiry, processes currently known as ''[[abductive reasoning|abductive]]'', ''[[deductive reasoning|deductive]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]'' [[inference]]. Peirce also called abduction &quot;retroduction&quot;, &quot;presumption&quot;, and, earliest of all, &quot;hypothesis&quot;. He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical [[syllogism]] Barbara (AAA), for example in &quot;Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis&quot; (1878).&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 13, pp. 470–82, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=u8sWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA472 472]. CP 2.619–44, see 623.&lt;/ref&gt; He does this by rearranging the ''rule'' (Barbara's major premiss), the ''case'' (Barbara's minor premiss), and the ''result'' (Barbara's conclusion):

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
Deduction.

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
''Case:'' These beans are from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Result:'' These beans are white.
{{col-break|width=1%}}
{{col-break}}
Induction.

''Case:'' These beans are &amp;#91;randomly selected&amp;#93; from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
''Result:'' These beans are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white.
{{col-break|width=1%}}
{{col-break}}
Hypothesis (Abduction).

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
''Result:'' These beans [oddly] are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.
{{col-end}}

Peirce 1883 in &quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before&lt;ref name=SCFI/&gt;). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:&lt;ref&gt;See, under &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]&quot; at CDPT, the following quotes:

{{quote|The surprising fact, C, is observed;
:But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,
:Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.}}
The logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. &quot;Deduction proves that something ''must'' be; Induction shows that something ''actually is'' operative; Abduction merely suggests that something ''may be''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lectures on Pragmatism&quot;, 1903, CP 5.171.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to J. H. Kehler (dated 1911), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 3, pp. 203–4, see in &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/retroduction.html Retroduction]&quot; at CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt; In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.

*Pragmatism (1907 MS in EP 2)&lt;/div&gt; Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called ''[[pragmatism]]'' and, later, ''[[pragmaticism]]'', is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called ''[[pragmatic maxim]]''. Here is one of his more [[Pragmatic maxim#2|emphatic reiterations]] of it:

{{quote|Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have. Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.}}

As a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, [[William James]], and others in [[the Metaphysical Club]]. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as &quot;[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]&quot; (1877) and especially &quot;[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]&quot; (1878) as foundational to [[pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1897), ''The Will to Believe'', see p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods. In 1905 Peirce coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] &quot;for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition&quot;, saying that &quot;all went happily&quot; with James's and [[F.C.S. Schiller]]'s variant uses of the old name &quot;pragmatism&quot; and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in &quot;literary journals, where it gets abused&quot;. Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name]] for discussion and references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series of articles. In the second one, &lt;span id=defs&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]&quot;, Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception: 
#Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
#Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea &quot;distinct&quot;, that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition &quot;nominal&quot; (CP 5.553).
#Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. In clearness's second grade (the &quot;nominal&quot; grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;&quot;That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;, in Peirce (1878 April), &quot;The Probability of Induction&quot;, p. [http://www.archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] (via ''Internet Archive'' ) in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705–18. Reprinted in CP 2.669–93, W 3:290–305, EP 1:155–69, elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in &quot;[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]&quot; implied by &quot;acceptance&quot; of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to &quot;vulgar&quot; pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), CP 5.13 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.&lt;ref&gt;See CP 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in &quot;The Spirit of Scholasticism&quot;), where Peirce ascribed the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called &quot;Methodeutic&quot; and &quot;Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric&quot;. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

====Theory of inquiry====
{{See also|Inquiry}}

=====Critical common-sensism=====
Critical common-sensism,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), &quot;Issues of Pragmaticism&quot;, ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 481]-99. Reprinted CP 5.438-63. Also important: CP 5.497-525.&lt;/ref&gt; treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy]] with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into actual question, for example because of science's transformation of our world. It includes efforts to work up genuine doubts in tests for a core group of common indubitables that varies slowly if at all.

=====Rival methods of inquiry=====
In [[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]] (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched '''four methods''' of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
#The method of '''tenacity''' (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
#The method of '''authority''' — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
#The method of '''congruity''' or the ''a priori'' or the dilettante or &quot;what is agreeable to reason&quot; — which promotes conformity less brutally, but depends on taste and fashion in [[paradigm]]s and can go in circles over time, along with barren disputation. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains capricious and accidental beliefs, destining some minds to doubts.
#The method of '''science''' — wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, &quot;Philosophy and the Conduct of Life&quot;, Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, CP 1.616–48 in part and ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'', 105–22, reprinted in EP 2:27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's &quot;first rule&quot;&lt;ref name=FRL/&gt; is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. [[Scientific method]] excels the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive — eventually — at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

=====Scientific method=====
Insofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]''; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

Peirce's approach, based in his critique of three [[#Modes of inference|modes of argument]], differs from approaches based in either [[foundationalism]] or [[coherentism]] about justification of claims, by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry: 

#Active, [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;
#Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;
#Inductive testing and evaluation of the provisional theory's utility for the anticipation of future experience, in both senses: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''.

Thereby he fleshed out an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''&lt;span lang=la&gt;simpliciter&lt;/span&gt;'', which is a mere relabeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.

Peirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.

Abduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward inquiry's end. In the pragmatic way of thinking in terms of conceivable practical implications, every thing has a [[purpose]], and its purpose is the first thing that we should try to note about it. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, inquiry's [[integrity]] strongly limits the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of inquiry's principal components.

Peirce outlined the scientific method as follows, in §III–IV in &quot;A Neglected Argument&quot;&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), &quot;[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]&quot;, published in large part, ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, 90–112. Reprinted with an unpublished part, CP 6.452–85, ''Selected Writings'' pp. 358–79, EP 2:434–50, ''Peirce on Signs'' 260–78.&lt;/ref&gt; (except as otherwise noted), wherein he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of [[#Modes of inference|modes of inference]]).

1. '''Abductive''' (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. Oftenest even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the &quot;facile and natural&quot;, as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from &quot;logical simplicity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), &quot;[http://www.unav.es/users/LumeNaturale.html Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God]&quot;, ''Semiotiche'' I/2, 91–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (c. 1906), &quot;PAP (Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism)&quot; (MS 293), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, pp. 319–20, first quote under &quot;[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]&quot; at CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 Peirce called pragmatism &quot;the logic of abduction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), &quot;Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction&quot;, CP 5.195–205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; It points to efficiency. Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application, MS L75.279-280: [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27], Draft B.&lt;/ref&gt; and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;See MS L75.329–330, from Draft D of [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27] of Peirce's application to the Carnegie Institution: {{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess's objective probability gives value to its trial, while subjective likelihood can be misleading. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for which Peirce offered as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., &quot;On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents&quot;, EP 2, see 107-9. On Twenty Questions, see 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; economy of research is what demands the &quot;leap&quot; of abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

2. '''Deductive''' phase. Two stages:
:i. Explication. Unclearly premissed, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.
:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions about evidence to be found. Corollarial or, if needed, Theorematic.

3. '''Inductive''' phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real &quot;is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;;&lt;ref name=Induction/&gt; anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:
:i. Classification. Unclearly premissed, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.
:ii. Probation: direct (and explicit) Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Induction depends on estimating the various evidential weights of the qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also CP 7.114–20). Quantitative Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of ''S'', ''S'' is found actually accompanied by ''P'' that was predicted for ''S'' (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.
:iii. Sentential Induction. &quot;...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result&quot;.

=====Against Cartesianism=====
Peirce drew on the methodological implications of the [[#Four incapacities|four incapacities]] — no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable — to attack philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]], of which he said that:&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt;

1. &quot;It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt&quot; — when, instead, we start with preconceptions, &quot;prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us ''can'' be questioned&quot;, though we may find reason to question them later. &quot;Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.&quot;

2. &quot;It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness&quot; — when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When &quot;candid and disciplined minds&quot; continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.

3. It trusts to &quot;a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses&quot; — when, instead, philosophy should, &quot;like the successful sciences&quot;, proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to &quot;the multitude and variety of its arguments&quot; as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but &quot;a cable whose fibers&quot;, soever &quot;slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected&quot;.

4. It renders many facts &quot;absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce believed in God. See section [[#Philosophy: Metaphysics]].&lt;/ref&gt; — when, instead, philosophy should avoid being &quot;unidealistic&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;However, Peirce disagreed with Hegelian [[absolute idealism]]. See for example CP 8.131.&lt;/ref&gt; misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, &quot;some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate&quot;, which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.

Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) [[wikt:psychical|psychical]] or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.

'''Ontology.''' Peirce was a Scholastic Realist, declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1868), &quot;Nominalism versus Realism&quot;, ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 1, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA57 57]-61. Reprinted (CP 6.619–24), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_14/v2_14.htm W 2:144–53]).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 &quot;The Logic of Relatives&quot; he wrote: {{quote|I formerly defined the possible as that which in a given state of information (real or feigned) we do not know not to be true. But this definition today seems to me only a twisted phrase which, by means of two negatives, conceals an anacoluthon. We know in advance of experience that certain things are not true, because we see they are impossible.}} Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they ''would'' behave under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;On developments in Peirce's realism, see:

'''Psychical or Religious Metaphysics.''' Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits — and it is a belief in God not as an ''actual'' or ''existent'' being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a ''real'' being.&lt;ref name=Godasreal&gt;Peirce in his 1906 &quot;Answers to Questions concerning my Belief in God&quot;, CP 6.495, [http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm Eprint], reprinted in part as &quot;The Concept of God&quot; in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', J. Buchler, ed., 1940, pp. 375–8: {{quote|I will also take the liberty of substituting &quot;reality&quot; for &quot;existence.&quot; This is perhaps overscrupulosity; but I myself always use ''exist'' in its strict philosophical sense of &quot;react with the other like things in the environment.&quot; Of course, in that sense, it would be fetichism to say that God &quot;exists.&quot; The word &quot;reality,&quot; on the contrary, is used in ordinary parlance in its correct philosophical sense. [....] I define the ''real'' as that which holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have ''thought'' them to be, or ever will have ''thought'' them to be, here using thought to include, imagining, opining, and willing (as long as forcible ''means'' are not used); but the real thing's characters will remain absolutely untouched.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Wikisource:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]&quot; (1908),&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will &quot;stand or fall with the hypothesis&quot;; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an &quot;infinitely incomprehensible&quot; being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be ''more'' false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free&lt;ref&gt;See his [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#MMS|&quot;The Doctrine of Necessity Examined&quot; (1892) and &quot;Reply to the Necessitarians&quot; (1893)]], to both of which editor [[Paul Carus]] responded.&lt;/ref&gt; and (see [[Synechism]]) that the soul is immortal.

'''Physical Metaphysics.''' Peirce held the view, which he called [[objective idealism]], that &quot;matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1891), &quot;The Architecture of Theories&quot;,'' [[The Monist]]'' v. 1, pp. [http://www.archive.org/stream/monistquart01hegeuoft#page/161/mode/1up 161]–76, see [http://www.archive.org/stream/monistquart01hegeuoft#page/170/mode/1up p. 170], via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted (CP 6.7–34) and (EP 1:285–97, see p. 293).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce asserted the reality of (1) chance (his [[Tychism|tychist]] view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love ([[Agapism|agapist]] view), echoing his [[#Theory of categories|categories]] Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called &quot;sporting&quot;), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called &quot;tychasm&quot;, &quot;anancasm&quot;, and &quot;agapasm&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;tychism&quot;, &quot;tychasm&quot;, &quot;tychasticism&quot;, and the rest, at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt;) of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]]; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893), &quot;Evolutionary Love&quot;, ''The Monist'' v. 3, pp. 176–200. Reprinted CP 6.278–317, EP 1:352–72. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/evolove/evolove.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; especially of space, time, and law.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 115 in ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'' (Peirce's 1898 lectures).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of review==
{{Main|Classification of the sciences (Peirce)}}
Peirce outlined two fields, &quot;Cenoscopy&quot; and &quot;Science of Review&quot;, both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science.  In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:&lt;ref name=phil/&gt;

# Science of Discovery.
## Mathematics.
## Cenoscopy (philosophy as discussed earlier in this article—categorial, normative, metaphysical), as First Philosophy, concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and includes the ''general'' study of inquiry and scientific method.
## Idioscopy, or the Special Sciences (of nature and mind).
# Science of Review, as Ultimate Philosophy, arranges &quot;...the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science&quot;. His examples included  [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The .22Cosmos.22|Cosmos]]'', [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''&lt;span lang=fr&gt;Philosophie positive&lt;/span&gt;'', and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''.
# Practical Science, or the Arts.

Peirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.

[[File:Carnot-engine-1824.png|175px|thumb|right|[[Axial]] [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of Carnot's heat engine. In this diagram, ''abcd'' is a cylindrical vessel, ''cd'' is a movable [[piston]], and ''A'' and ''B'' are constant–temperature bodies. The vessel may be placed in contact with either body or removed from both (as it is here).&lt;ref&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;1 in Carnot (1824, p. 17) and Carnot (1890, p. 63). In the diagram, the diameter of the vessel is large enough to bridge the space between the two bodies, but in the model, the vessel is never in contact with both bodies simultaneously. Also, the diagram shows an unlabeled axial rod attached to the outside of the piston.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
A '''Carnot heat engine'''&lt;ref&gt;In French, Carnot uses ''machine à feu'', which Thurston translates as ''heat-engine'' or ''steam-engine''. In a footnote, Carnot distinguishes the steam-engine (''machine à vapeur'') from the heat-engine in general. (Carnot, 1824, p. 5 and Carnot, 1890, p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical engine that operates on the reversible [[Carnot cycle]]. The basic model for this engine was developed by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]] in 1824.  The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] in 1834 and mathematically elaborated upon by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in the 1850s and 60s from which the concept of [[entropy]] emerged.

Every thermodynamic system exists in a particular [[thermodynamic state|state]]. A [[thermodynamic cycle]] occurs when a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a [[heat engine]].

A heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to [[mechanical work]]. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a [[refrigerator]] or [[heat pump]] rather than a heat engine.

In the adjacent diagram, from Carnot's 1824 work, ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AReflections+on+the+motive+power+of+fire+au%3Acarnot Sometimes translated as ''Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire'']&lt;/ref&gt; there are &quot;two bodies ''A'' and ''B'', kept each at a constant temperature, that of ''A'' being higher than that of ''B''.  These two bodies, to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of [[Caloric theory|caloric]].  We will call the first the [[furnace]] and the second the refrigerator.”&lt;ref&gt;English translation by Thurston (Carnot, 1890, p. 51-52).&lt;/ref&gt; Carnot then explains how we can obtain [[motive power]], i.e. “work”, by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body ''A'' to body ''B''.

== Modern diagram ==
[[File:Carnot heat engine 2.svg|300px|thumb|right|Carnot engine diagram (modern) - where heat flows from a high temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' furnace through the fluid of the &quot;working body&quot; (working substance) and into the cold sink ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', thus forcing the working substance to do [[mechanical work]] ''W'' on the surroundings, via cycles of contractions and expansions.]]

The previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine.  The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine.  In the diagram, the “working body” (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which [[heat]] ''Q'' can be introduced or transmitted to produce work.  Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, or air, etc.  Although, in these early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically ''Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; ''Q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' was typically a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] located on a separate part of the engine.  The output work ''W'' here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines.  Carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height”.

== Carnot's theorem ==
{{main|Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)}}
[[File:Real vs Carnot.png|500px|thumb|right|A real engine (left) compared to the Carnot cycle (right). The entropy of a real material changes with temperature. This change is indicated by the curve on a [[Temperature entropy diagram|T-S diagram]]. For this figure, the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium (''See [[Rankine cycle]]''). Irreversible systems and losses of heat (for example, due to friction) prevent the ideal from taking place at every step.]]

'''Carnot's theorem''' is a formal statement of this fact: ''No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.'' 

This maximum efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{W}{Q_H}=1-\frac{T_C}{T_H}
\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad(1)&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work),
: &lt;math&gt; Q_H &lt;/math&gt; is the heat put into the system (heat energy entering the system),
: &lt;math&gt; T_C &lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]] of the cold reservoir, and 
: &lt;math&gt; T_H &lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot reservoir.

A corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: ''All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.''  

In other words, maximum efficiency is achieved if and only if no new [[entropy]] is created in the cycle. Otherwise, since [[entropy]] is a [[state function]], the required dumping of heat into the environment to dispose of excess [[entropy]] leads to a reduction in efficiency. So Equation (1) gives the efficiency of any [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] [[heat engine]].

The Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.

== Efficiency of real heat engines ==
Carnot realized that in reality it is not possible to build a [[Thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamically reversible]] engine, so real heat engines are less efficient than indicated by Equation (1).  Nevertheless, Equation (1) is extremely useful for determining the maximum efficiency that could ever be expected for a given set of thermal reservoirs.

Although '''Carnot's cycle''' is an idealisation, the expression 
of Carnot efficiency is still useful. Consider the [[average]] temperatures,

:    &lt;math&gt;\langle T_H \rangle = \frac{1}{\Delta S} \int_{Q_{in}} TdS &lt;/math&gt;

:    &lt;math&gt;\langle T_C \rangle = \frac{1}{\Delta S} \int_{Q_{out}} TdS &lt;/math&gt;

at which heat is input and output, respectively.  Replace ''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' in Equation (1) by &lt;''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt; and &lt;''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt; respectively.

For the Carnot cycle, or an equivalent, &lt;''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt; is the highest temperature available and &lt;''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt; the lowest. For other less efficient cycles, &lt;''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt; will be lower than ''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' , and &lt;''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt; will be higher than ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''. This can help illustrate, for example, why a [[reheater]] or a [[regenerator]] can improve thermal efficiency.

'''Central America''' ({{lang-es|América Central'' or ''Centroamérica}}) is the central [[geography|geographic]] [[region]] of the [[Americas]]. It is the southernmost, [[isthmus|isthmian]] portion of the [[North America]]n [[continent]], which connects with [[South America]] on the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574502/Central_America.html Central America], ''MSN Encarta''.

ISBN 0-85229-511-1.&lt;/ref&gt; When considered part of the unified [[continent|continental model]], it is considered a [[subcontinent]]. Central America consists of the [[sovereign state|states]] of [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]]. Central America is part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[biodiversity hotspot]], which extends from Northern Guatemala through central Panama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/mesoamerica/Pages/default.aspx Mesoamerica], Biodiversity Hotspots, [[Conservation International]].  Accessed on line January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It borders [[Mexico]] to the north, the Caribbean Sea to the east, the North Pacific Ocean to the west; and [[Colombia]] to the south-east.

Central America has an area of 524,000 square kilometers (202,000 sq mi), or almost 0.1% of the Earth's surface. As of 2009, its population was estimated at 41,739,000. It has a density of 77 people per square kilometer or 206 people per square mile.

==History==
{{main|History of Central America}}
[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|left|Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean from 1700 to present]]
In [[pre-Columbian]] times, the north-western areas of modern Central America were part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Maya]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztecs]], who created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]], and can be considered transitional between those two cultural areas.

Following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of the [[Americas]] for [[Spain]], the Spanish sent numerous expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lands in the 1520s. In 1540, Spain established the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], which extended from southern [[Mexico]] to [[Costa Rica]], and thus encompassed most of what is currently known as Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras]] (present-day Belize). This lasted nearly three centuries, until a rebellion (which followed closely on the heels of the [[Mexican War of Independence]]) in 1821.

After the dissolution of Spanish authority, the former [[Captaincy General]] remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]], then turned into the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the present day nations of Guatemala (which included the former state of [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]]), El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica (which included a region which is now part of Panama, and the [[Guanacaste Province]] which was once part of [[Nicaragua]]), and [[Soconusco]], a portion of the modern Mexican state of Chiapas. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it began to disintegrate due to [[civil war]]s.

==Geography==
Central America has an area of 524,000 square kilometers (202,000 sq mi), or almost 0.1% of the Earth's surface. As of 2009, its population was estimated at 41,739,000. It has a density of 77 people per square kilometer or 206 people per square mile.

===Physical geography===
[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|left|Central America and the [[Caribbean Plate]].]]
[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], Central America is the tapering [[isthmus]]
of southern North America, extending from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in southern [[Mexico]]
southeastward to the [[Isthmus of Panama]] where it connects to the [[Colombia]]n
[[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific Lowlands]] in northwestern [[South America]].
Alternatively, the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] delimits the region on the north.
Central America has an area of some 592,000 square kilometres.
The [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the southwest, the [[Caribbean Sea]] lies to the northeast,
and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] lies to the north.
Most of Central America rests atop the [[Caribbean Plate]].

The region is geologically active, with [[volcanic eruption]]s and [[earthquake]]s occurring from time to time.
In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquake]], killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of [[Nicaragua]], was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killed about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated [[El Salvador]], one in 1986 and two in 2001; one [[2009 Costa Rica earthquake|earthquake]] devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009 killing at least 34 people; in [[2009 Honduras earthquake|Honduras]] a powerful earthquake killed 7 people in 2009.

Volcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

Central America has many [[mountain range]]s; the longest are the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], the [[Cordillera Isabelia]] and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]]. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact most of the population of [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]] live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans and other crops.

Central America is part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Biodiversity hotspot]], boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;webng.com&quot;&gt;http://www.webng.com/jerbarker/home/eia-toolkit/downloads/Van04/RojasVancouver.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As a bridge between [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], Central America has many species from the [[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]] and the [[Neotropic ecozone]]s. However the southern countries ([[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]]) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries ([[Guatemala]] and Belize), meanwhile the central countries ([[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]]) have least biodiversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;webng.com&quot; /&gt; The table shows current statistics for the seven countries:

==Foreign relations==
Until recently, all Central American countries have maintained diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.tw/webapp/ct.asp?xItem=11624&amp;CtNode=1143&amp;mp=1 |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China |publisher=Mofa.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, however, established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 2007, severing formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan).
