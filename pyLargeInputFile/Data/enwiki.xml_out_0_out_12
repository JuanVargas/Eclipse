An '''abbess''' ([[Latin]] ''abbatissa'', [[Grammatical gender|feminine form]] of ''abbas,'' [[abbot]]) is the female [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]], or '''mother superior''', of an [[abbey]] of [[nun]]s.

In the [[Catholic Church]] (both the [[Latin Rite]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Coptic]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] abbeys, the mode of election, position, rights, and authority of an abbess correspond generally with those of an abbot. The office is elective, the choice being by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Like an abbot, an abbess is solemnly admitted to her office by formal blessing, conferred by the bishop in whose territory the monastery is located, or by an abbot or another [[bishop]] with appropriate permission. Unlike the abbot, the abbess receives only the ring and a copy of the rule of the order. She does not receive a [[mitre]] nor is given a [[crosier]] as part of the ceremony; however, by ancient tradition, she may carry a crosier when leading her community.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The abbess also traditionally adds a [[pectoral cross]] to her habit as a symbol of office.{{sfn|Oestreich|1907}}

Abbesses are, like abbots, major superiors according to [[canon law]]. They receive the vows of the nuns of the abbey and have full authority in its administration. As they do not receive [[Holy Orders]] in the Catholic, Orthodox and Oriental Churches they do not possess certain powers conferred upon abbots, nor do they exercise authority over territories outside of their monastery.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Historically, in some [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] monasteries abbesses presided over joint-houses of monks and nuns,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} the most famous example being Saint [[Brigid of Kildare|Brigid of Kildare's]] leadership in the founding of the monastery at [[Kildare]] in [[Ireland]]. This custom accompanied Celtic monastic missions to [[France]], [[Spain]], and even to [[Rome]] itself. In 1115, Robert, the founder of [[Fontevraud Abbey]] near [[Chinon]] and [[Saumur]], France, committed the government of the whole order, men as well as women, to a female superior.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches the title of abbess (''Äbtissin'') has in some cases (e.g. Itzehoe) survived to designate the heads of abbeys which since the [[Protestant Reformation]] have continued as ''Stifte''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} These are collegiate foundations, which provide a home and an income for unmarried ladies, generally of noble birth, called canonesses (''Kanonissinen'') or more usually ''Stiftsdamen''. The office of abbess is of considerable social dignity, and in the past, was sometimes filled by princesses of the reigning houses. Until the dissolution of [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[German Mediatisation|mediatization]] of smaller imperial fiefs by Napoleon, the evangelical Abbess of [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Quedlinburg]] was also per officio the head of that ''[[reichsunmittelbar]]'' state. The last such ruling abbess was [[Sofia Albertina, Princess of Sweden]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

      <comment>r2.7.1) (robot Adding: [[ru:Абдоминальная хирургия]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''''abdominal surgery''''' broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the [[abdomen]].  Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see [[stomach]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. [[appendicitis]]).

== Types ==
The three most common abdominal surgeries are described below. 

*Exploratory [[laparotomy]] -- This refers to the opening of the [[abdominal cavity]] for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. It may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem.
*[[Appendectomy]] -- Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]].  Typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure.
*[[Laparoscopy]] -- A [[minimally invasive]] approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. The tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room.  The surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy ([[gallbladder]] removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure.  The laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional &quot;open&quot; [[cholecystectomy]].

== Complications ==
Complications of abdominal surgery include 
* [[hemorrhage|bleeding]],
* [[infection]],
* post-surgical [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]
* [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and
* [[ileus]], or more commonly [[Paralytic ileus]] (short-term paralysis of the bowel)

Sterile technique, [[aseptic]] post-operative care, [[antibiotics]], and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications.  Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions.  The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.

[[File:Maderturm.jpg|thumb|Maderturm]]
'''Abensberg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːbənsˌbɛʁk}}) is a town in the [[Lower Bavaria]]n [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Kelheim (district)|Kelheim]], in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], lying around 30&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Regensburg]], 40&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Ingolstadt]], 50 northwest of [[Landshut]] and 100&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Munich]]. It is situated on the [[Abens]] river, a tributary of the [[Danube]].

==Geography==
The town lies on the [[Abens]] river, a tributary of the [[Danube]], around eight kilometres from the river's source. The area around Abensberg is characterized by the narrow valley of the Danube, where the [[Weltenburg Abbey]] stands, the valley of the [[Altmühl]] in the north, a left tributary of the Danube, and the famous [[Hallertau]] [[Humulus|hops-planting]] region in the south. The town is divided into the municipalities of Abensberg, Arnhofen, Holzharland, Hörlbach, Offenstetten, Pullach and Sandharland.

===Divisions===
Since the administrative reforms in Bavaria in the 1970s, the town also encompasses the following [[Quarter (country subdivision)|''Ortsteile'']]:

* In the town: Abensberg (main settlement), Aunkofen (civil parish), Badhaus (village)
* To the east: Gaden (village), See (village), Offenstetten (civil parish)
* To the north east: Arnhofen (civil parish), Baiern (village), Pullach (civil parish), Kleedorf (village)
* To the north: Sandharlanden (civil parish), Holzharlanden (civil parish), Buchhof (small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]])
* To the west: Schwaighausen (village), Schillhof (hamlet), Gilla (small hamlet)
* To the south: Aumühle (small hamlet), Allersdorf (hamlet)
* To the south east: Lehen (small hamlet), Mitterhörlbach (hamlet), Upper Hörlbach (village), Lower Hörlbach (hamlet)

==History==
There had been settlement on this part of the [[Abens]] river since long before the [[High Middle Ages]], dating back to [[Neolithic]] times. Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, [[Stone Age]] people made flint, which was fashioned into drills, blades and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the 3rd century Roman [[castra]] (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, in the middle of the 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of ''Habensperch'', came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.

In 1256, the [[castrum]] of ''Abensprech'' was first mentioned, and on 12 June 1348, Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg, and his brother, Stephen, Duke of Bavaria, raised Abensberg to the status of a city, giving it the right to operate lower courts, enclose itself with a wall and hold markets. The wall was built by Ulrich III, Count of Abensberg. Some of the thirty-two round towers and eight turrets are still preserved to this day.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the people of Abensberg enjoyed a level of autonomy above their lord. They elected a city council, although only a small number of rich families were eligible for election.

In around 1390, the Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Abensberg was founded by Count John II and his wife, Agnes. Although Abensberg was an autonomous city, it remained dependent on the powerful [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Dukes of Bavaria]]. The last Lord of Abensberg, Nicholas, supposedly named after his godfather, [[Nicholas of Kues]], a Catholic cardinal, was murdered in 1485 by Christopher, a [[Herzog (title)|Duke]] of [[Bavaria-Munich]]. The year before, Nicholas had unchivalrously taken Christopher captive as he bathed before a tournament in Munich. Although Christopher renounced his claim for revenge, he lay in wait for Nicholas in Friesling. When the latter arrived, he was killed by Seitz von Frauenberg. He is buried in the former convent of Abensberg. Abensberg then lost its independence and became a part of the Duchy of Bavaria, and from then on was administered by a ducal official, the so-called caretaker. The castle of Abensberg was destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]], although the city had bought a guarantee of protection from the Swesidh general, [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]]. [[Johannes Aventinus]] (1477–1534) is the city's most famous son, the founder of the study of history in Bavaria. Aventinus, whose name was real name is Johann or Johannes Turmair (''Aventinus'' being the Latin name of his birthplace) wrote the ''Annals of Bavaria'', a valuable record of the early history of Germany and the first major written work on the subject. He is commemorated in the [[Walhalla temple]], a monument near [[Regensburg]] to the distinguished figures of German history. Until 1800, Abensberg was a municipality belonging to the [[Straubing]] district of the [[Prince-elector|Electorate]] of Bavaria. Abensberg also contained a [[magistrates' court]]. In the [[Battle of Abensberg]] on 19–20 April 1809, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] gained a significant victory over the Austrians under [[Archduke Louis of Austria]] and General [[Johann von Hiller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|author=Anonymous|wstitle=Abensberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms===
[[File:Wappen Abensberg.png|thumb|right|100px|Arms of Abensberg]]

The arms of the city are divided into two halves. On the left are the blue and white rhombuses of Bavaria, while the right half is split into two sliver and black triangles. Two diagonally-crossed silver swords with golden handles rest on top.

The town has had a coat of arms since 1338, that of the Counts of Abensberg. With the death of the last Count, Nicholas of Abensberg, in 1485, the estates fell to the Duchy of Bavaria-Munich, meaning that henceforth only the Bavarian coat of arms was ever used.

On 31 December 1809, a decree of [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian of Bavaria]] granted the city a new coat of arms, as a recognition of their (mainly humanitarian and logistic) services in the [[Battle of Abensberg]] the same year. The diagonally divided field in silver and black came from the old crest of the Counts of Abensberg, while the white and blue diamonds came from that of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], the rulers of Bavaria. The swords recall the Battle of Abensberg.

The district of Offenstetten previously possessed its own coat of arms.

The area around Abensberg, the so-called sand belt between [[Siegburg]], [[Neustadt an der Donau]], Abensberg and [[Langquaid]], is used for the intensive farming of [[asparagus]], due to the optimal soil condition and climate. 212 hectares of land can produce ninety-four asparagus plants. Abensberg asparagus enjoys a reputation among connoisseurs as a particular delicacy. In addition to asparagus, the production of hops plays a major role locally, the region having its own label, and there are still three independent breweries in the area. The town of Abensberg marks the start of the ''Deutsche Hopfenstraße'' (''German Hops Road''), a nickname given to the [[Bundesstraße]] 301, a German federal highway which runs through the heartland of Germany's hops-growing industry, ending in [[Freising]].

===Transport===
The Abensberg railway station is located on the [[Danube Valley Railway (Bavaria)|Danube Valley Railway]] from [[Regensburg Hauptbahnhof|Regensburg]] to [[Ingolstadt Hauptbahnhof|Ingolstadt]]. The city can be reached via the A-93 Holledau-Regensburg road (exit Abensberg). Three [[Bundesstraße]] (German federal highways) cross south of Abensberg: [[Bundesstraße 16|B 16]], [[Bundesstraße 299|B 299]] and B 301.

==Public facilities==
===Schools===
{{see also|Education in Germany}}
Abensberg has a Grundschule (primary school) and [[Hauptschule]] (open admission secondary school), and the Johann-Turmair-[[Realschule]](secondary modern school). There is also a College of Agriculture and Home Economics. Since 2007, the Kelheim Berufsschule has had a campus in Abensberg, and outside the state sector is the St. Francis Vocational Training Centre, run by a Catholic youth organisation.

==Culture and sightseeing==
===Theatre===
In 2008, a former [[goods shed]] by the main railway station of Abensberg was converted into a theatre by local volunteers. The &quot;Theater am Bahnhof&quot; (''Theatre at the Railway Station'') is mostly used by the ''Theatergruppe Lampenfieber'' and was opened on 19 October 2008.

===Museums===
Abensberg has a long tradition of museums. In the nineteenth century, Nicholas Stark und Peter Paul Dollinger began a collection based on local history. This collection and the collection of the ''Heimatverein'' (local history society) were united in 1963 into the [[Johannes Aventinus|Aventinus]] Museum, in the cloister of the former carmelite monastery. On 7 July 2006, the new Town Museum of Abensberg was opened in the former duke's castle in the town.

===Missing memorial===
Up until the 1950s, Abensberg and the surrounding villages contained a number of graves of victims of a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|Death March]] in the Spring of 1945 from the Hersbruck sub-camp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]], who were either murdered by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] or died of exhaustion. They were originally buried where they died, but were later moved on the orders of the US military government to the cemeteries of their previous homes. At the cemetery in what is now the district of [[Pullach]] stood a memorial stone which was mentioned as recently as 1967, but which is no longer at the site. The suffering of ten unknown victims of the camp was recorded on the stone.

===Regular events===
*The Abensberger events calendar begins in February with the ''[[Carnival|Faschingsgillamoos]]'' [[funfair]], which reaches its high point on Mad Thursday.
*There then follows the ''Frühjahrsmarkt'' (Spring market) two weeks before Easter, when all the shops in the town are permitted to open on Sunday ([[Ladenschlussgesetz|which is normally prohibited in Bavaria]]).
*
*The ''Bürgerfest'' is celebrated on the first weekend of July, when the palace gardens with their ancient walls are transformed into a medieval camp.
*The ''Schlossgartenfest'' (Palace Garden Festival) takes place every year at the beginning of August.

{{Arminianism}}

'''Arminianism''' is a school of [[Soteriology|soteriological]] thought within [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]] based on the [[Christian theology|theological]] ideas of the [[Dutch Reformed]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560–1609)&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus (ed). ''Chambers Biographical Dictionary'' (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995) 62&lt;/ref&gt; and his historic followers, the [[Remonstrants]]. The doctrine's acceptance stretches through much of Christianity from the early arguments between [[Athanasius]] and [[Origen]], to [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s defense of &quot;[[original sin]].&quot; 

Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the Dutch states general. The Synod of Dort (1618–19) was called by the states general to pass upon the Remonstrance. The five points of the Remonstrance asserted that: 
# election (and condemnation on the day of judgment) was conditioned by the rational faith or nonfaith of man; 
# the Atonement, while qualitatively adequate for all men, was efficacious only for the man of faith; 
# unaided by the Holy Spirit, no person is able to respond to God’s will; 
# grace is not irresistible; and 
# believers are able to resist sin but are not beyond the possibility of falling from grace. 
The crux of Remonstrant Arminianism lay in the assertion that human dignity requires an unimpaired freedom of the will.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/35372/Arminianism&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 16th century, Christians of many sects including the [[Baptists]] (See ''A History of the Baptists'' Third Edition by Robert G. Torbet) have been influenced by Arminian views. So have the [[Methodists]], the [[Congregationalists]] of the early New England colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the [[Universalists]] and [[Unitarians]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Arminianism is most accurately used to define those who affirm the original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself, but the term can also be understood as an umbrella for a larger grouping of ideas including those of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]] and others.  There are two primary perspectives on how the system is applied in detail: Classical Arminianism, which sees Arminius as its figurehead, and Wesleyan Arminianism, which sees John Wesley as its figurehead. Wesleyan Arminianism is sometimes synonymous with Methodism. In addition, Arminianism is often misrepresented by some of its critics to include [[Semipelagianism]] or even [[Pelagianism]], though proponents of both primary perspectives vehemently deny these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Roger E. ''Arminian Theology: Myths and Realities'' (Downers Grove: Intervarsity Press, 2006) 17–18, 23, 80–82, 142–145, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the broad scope of the [[History of Christianity|history of Christian theology]], Arminianism is closely related to [[Calvinism]] (or Reformed theology), and the two systems share both history and many doctrines. Nonetheless, they are often viewed as rivals within evangelicalism because of their disagreement over details of the doctrines of divine [[predestination]] and [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Justo L. ''The Story of Christianity, Vol. Two: The Reformation to the Present Day'' (New York: Harpercollins Publishers, 1985; reprint – Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate|Free will in theology}}

[[File:Arminius2 50.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Jacobus Arminius]].]]

Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch pastor and theologian in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He was taught by [[Theodore Beza]], [[John Calvin|Calvin's]] hand-picked successor, but after examination of the Scriptures, he rejected his teacher's theology that it is God who unconditionally elects some for salvation. Instead Arminius proposed that the election of God was ''of believers'', thereby making it [[Conditional election|conditional on faith]]. Arminius's views were challenged by the Dutch Calvinists, especially [[Franciscus Gomarus]], but Arminius died before a national synod could occur.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Arminius's followers, not wanting to adopt their leader's name, called themselves the [[Remonstrants]]. When Arminius died before he could satisfy Holland's State General's request for a 14-page paper outlining his views, the Remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]]. After some political maneuvering, the Dutch Calvinists were able to convince [[Maurice de Nassau|Prince Maurice of Nassau]] to deal with the situation. Maurice systematically removed Arminian magistrates from office and called a national synod at Dordrecht. This [[Synod of Dort]] was open primarily to Dutch Calvinists (Arminians were excluded) with Calvinist representatives from other countries, and in 1618 published a condemnation of Arminius and his followers as heretics. Part of this publication was the famous [[Five points of Calvinism]] in response to the five articles of Remonstrance.  

Arminians across Holland were removed from office, imprisoned, banished, and sworn to silence. Twelve years later Holland officially granted Arminianism protection as a religion, although animosity between Arminians and Calvinists continued.

The debate between Calvin's followers and Arminius's followers is distinctive of post-Reformation church history. The emerging Baptist movement in 17th-century England, for example, was a microcosm of the historic debate between Calvinists and Arminians. The first Baptists–called &quot;[[General Baptists]]&quot; because of their confession of a &quot;general&quot; or unlimited atonement, were Arminians.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Justo L. ''The Story of Christianity, Vol. 2: The Reformation to the Present Day'' (HarperCollins Publishers, 1985; reprint – Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist movement originated with Thomas Helwys, who left his mentor John Smyth, who had moved into semi-Pelgianism and other distinctives of the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites of Amsterdam, and returned to London to start the first English Baptist Church in 1611. Later General Baptists such as John Griffith, Samuel Loveday, and Thomas Grantham defended a Reformed Arminian theology that reflected more the Arminianism of Arminius than that of the later Remonstrants or the English Arminianism of Arminian [[Puritans]] like John Goodwin or Anglican Arminians such as Jeremy Taylor and Henry Hammond. The General Baptists encapsulated their Arminian views in numerous confessions, the most influential of which was the Standard Confession of 1660. In the 1640s the Particular Baptists were formed, diverging strongly from Arminian doctrine and embracing the strong Calvinism of the Presbyterians and Independents. Their robust Calvinism was publicized in such confessions as the London Baptist Confession of 1644 and the Second London Confession of 1689. Interestingly, the London Confession of 1689 was later used by Calvinistic Baptists in America (called the Philadelphia Baptist Confession), whereas the Standard Confession of 1660 was used by the American heirs of the English General Baptists, who soon came to be known as [[Free Will Baptists]].

This same dynamic between Arminianism and [[Calvinism]] can be seen in the heated discussions between friends and fellow [[Methodist]] ministers [[John Wesley]] and [[George Whitefield]]. Wesley was a champion of Arminian teachings, defending his [[soteriology]] in a periodical titled ''The Arminian'' and writing articles such as ''Predestination Calmly Considered''. He defended Arminianism against charges of [[semi-Pelagianism]], holding strongly to beliefs in [[original sin]] and total depravity. At the same time, Wesley attacked the [[determinism]] that he claimed characterized unconditional election and maintained a belief in the [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints|ability to lose salvation]]. Wesley also clarified the doctrine of [[prevenient grace]] and preached the ability of Christians to attain to [[Christian perfection|perfection]]. While Wesley freely made use of the term &quot;Arminian,&quot; he did not self-consciously root his soteriology in the theology of Arminius but was highly influenced by 17th-century English Arminianism and thinkers such as John Goodwin, Jeremy Taylor and Henry Hammond of the Anglican &quot;Holy Living&quot; school, and the Remonstrant Hugo Grotius.

==Current landscape==
Advocates of both Arminianism and Calvinism find a home in many Protestant denominations, and sometimes both exist within the same denomination as with the [[Puritan]]s. Faiths leaning at least in part in the Arminian direction include [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Free Will Baptist]]s, [[General Baptist]]s, [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[The Salvation Army]], and [[Semi-Charismatic movement|Charismatics]]. Denominations leaning in the Calvinist direction are grouped as the [[Reformed churches]] and include [[Particular Baptist]]s, [[Reformed Baptist]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. The majority of [[Southern Baptists]], including [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], accept Arminianism with an exception allowing for a doctrine of [[perseverance of the saints]] (&quot;eternal security&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#iv &quot;The Baptist Faith and Message, 2000 Revision&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Richard W. ''Baptists and Other Denominations'' (Nashville: Convention Press, 1984) 17–18, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dongell, Joseph and Walls, Jerry ''Why I Am Not a Calvinist'' (Downer's Grove: Intervarsity Press, 2004) 12–13, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Many see Calvinism as growing in acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;Dongell 7–20&lt;/ref&gt; and some prominent Reformed Baptists, such as [[Albert Mohler]] and [[Mark Dever]], have been pushing for the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] to adopt a more Calvinistic orientation. [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] espouse a view of salvation and election distinct from both the Calvinist and Arminian schools of [[soteriology]].

The current scholarly support for Arminianism is wide and varied. One particular thrust is a return to the teachings of Arminius. F. Leroy Forlines, Robert Picirilli, Stephen Ashby and Matthew Pinson (see citations) are four of the more prominent supporters. Forlines has referred to this type of Arminianism as &quot;Classical Arminianism,&quot; while Picirilli, Pinson, and Ashby have termed it &quot;Reformation Arminianism&quot; or &quot;Reformed Arminianism.&quot;  Through [[Methodism]], Wesley's teachings also inspire a large scholarly following, with vocal proponents including [[J. Kenneth Grider]], [[Stanley Hauerwas]], [[Thomas Oden]], [[Thomas Jay Oord]], and [[William Willimon]].

Recent influence of the [[New Perspective on Paul]] movement has also reached Arminianism — primarily through a view of corporate election. The New Perspective scholars propose that the 1st century, [[Second Temple Judaism]] understood election primarily as national ([[Israelites]]) and racial ([[Jews]]), not as individual. Their conclusion is thus that Paul's writings on election should be interpreted in a similar corporate light. Leading proponents of this view include the British theologians, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] and [[Tom Wright (theologian)|N.T. Wright]]. Other Arminian theologians holding similar perspectives but not directly linked with the New Perspective movement include Robert Shank, Paul Marston, Roger Forster, Jerry Walls, [[Thomas Jay Oord]], Roger Olson, and Joseph Dongell (see citations). However, another stream of Arminian scholarship, represented by thinkers such as Jack Cottrell, Leroy Forlines, and Robert Picirilli, views election to salvation, similarly to Arminius, as personal and individual in nature.

==Theology==
Arminian theology usually falls into one of two groups — Classical Arminianism, drawn from the teaching of Jacobus Arminius — and Wesleyan Arminian, drawing primarily from Wesley. Both groups overlap substantially.

===Classical Arminianism===
Classical Arminianism (sometimes titled Reformed Arminianism or Reformation Arminianism) is the theological system that was presented by [[Jacobus Arminius]] and maintained by some of the [[Remonstrants]];&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Stephen &quot;Reformed Arminianism&quot; ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002), 137&lt;/ref&gt; its influence serves as the foundation for all Arminian systems. A list of beliefs is given below:

* '''Depravity is [[Total depravity|total]]''': Arminius states &quot;In this [fallen] state, the free will of man towards the true good is not only wounded, infirm, bent, and weakened; but it is also imprisoned, destroyed, and lost. And its powers are not only debilitated and useless unless they be assisted by grace, but it has no powers whatever except such as are excited by Divine grace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arminius, James ''The Writings of James Arminius'' (three vols.), tr. James Nichols and W.R. Bagnall (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1956), I:252&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Atonement is intended [[Unlimited atonement|for all]]''': Jesus's death was for all people, Jesus draws all people to himself, and all people have opportunity for salvation through faith.&lt;ref&gt;Arminius I:316&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jesus's death [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|satisfies]] God's justice''': The penalty for the sins of the elect is paid in full through Jesus's work on the cross. Thus Christ's atonement is intended for all, but requires faith to be effected. Arminius states that &quot;Justification, when used for the act of a Judge, is either purely the imputation of righteousness through mercy… or that man is justified before God… according to the rigor of justice without any forgiveness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arminius III:454&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Ashby clarifies: &quot;Arminius allowed for only two possible ways in which the sinner might be justified: (1) by our absolute and perfect adherence to the law, or (2) purely by God's imputation of Christ's righteousness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ashby ''Four Views'', 140&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Grace is resistible''': God takes initiative in the salvation process and His grace comes to all people. This grace (often called ''[[Prevenient Grace|prevenient]]'' or pre-regenerating grace) acts on all people to convince them of the Gospel, draw them strongly towards salvation, and enable the possibility of sincere faith. Picirilli states that &quot;indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resisted.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Picirilli, Robert ''Grace, Faith, Free Will: Contrasting Views of Salvation: Calvinism and Arminianism'' (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2002), 154ff&lt;/ref&gt; The offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied.&lt;ref&gt;Forlines, Leroy F., Pinson, Matthew J. and Ashby, Stephen M. ''The Quest for Truth: Answering Life's Inescapable Questions'' (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2001), 313–321&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Man has free will to respond or resist''': Free will is limited by God's sovereignty, but God's sovereignty allows all men the choice to accept the Gospel of Jesus through faith, simultaneously allowing all men to resist.
* '''Election is [[Conditional election|conditional]]''': Arminius defined ''election'' as &quot;the decree of God by which, of Himself, from eternity, He decreed to justify in Christ, believers, and to accept them unto eternal life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arminius III:311&quot;&gt;Arminius ''Writings'', III:311&lt;/ref&gt; God alone determines who will be saved and his determination is that all who believe Jesus through faith will be justified. According to Arminius, &quot;God regards no one in Christ unless they are engrafted in him by faith.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arminius III:311&quot; /&gt;
* '''God predestines the elect to a glorious future''': Predestination is not the predetermination of who will believe, but rather the predetermination of the believer's future inheritance. The elect are therefore predestined to sonship through adoption, glorification, and eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson, David ''Once Saved, Always Saved? A Study in Perseverance and Inheritance'' (London: Hodder &amp; Staughton, 1996), 109ff&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Christ's righteousness is imputed to the believer''': Justification is sola fide. When individuals repent and believe in Christ (saving faith), they are regenerated and brought into union with Christ, whereby the death and righteousness of Christ are imputed to them for their justification before God.&lt;ref&gt;Forlines, F. Leroy, ''Classical Arminianism: A Theology of Salvation, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Eternal security is also [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints|conditional]]''': All believers have full assurance of salvation with the condition that they remain in Christ. Salvation is conditioned on faith, therefore perseverance is also conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'' 203&lt;/ref&gt; Apostasy (turning from Christ) is only committed through a deliberate, willful rejection of Jesus and renunciation of saving faith. Such apostasy is irremediable.&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli 204ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Five articles of Remonstrance]] that Arminius's followers formulated in 1610 state the above beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistible grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. Note, however, that the fifth article did not completely deny perseverance of the saints; Arminius, himself, said that &quot;I never taught that a true believer can… fall away from the faith… yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such as kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arminius ''Writings'', I:254&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the text of the Articles of Remonstrance says that no believer can be plucked from Christ's hand, and the matter of falling away, &quot;loss of salvation&quot; required further study before it could be taught with any certainty.

The core beliefs of Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants are summarized as such by theologian Stephen Ashby:

# Prior to being ''drawn and enabled'', one is ''unable to believe… able only to resist.''
# Having been ''drawn and enabled'', but prior to regeneration, one is ''able to believe… able also to resist.''
# After one ''believes'', God then regenerates; one is ''able to continue believing… able also to resist.''
# Upon ''resisting'' to the point of ''unbelief'', one is ''unable again to believe… able only to resist.''&lt;ref&gt;Ashby ''Four Views'', 159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wesleyan Arminianism===
{{Methodism}}
{{Further|[[Methodism]]}}
John Wesley has historically been the most influential advocate for the teachings of Arminian soteriology. Wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what Arminius himself taught, maintaining strong doctrines of original sin, total depravity, conditional election, prevenient grace, unlimited atonement, and possibly apostasy.

Wesley departs from Classical Arminianism primarily on three issues:
* '''Atonement''' &amp;ndash; Wesley's atonement is a hybrid of the [[penal substitution]] theory and the [[Atonement (Governmental view)|governmental]] theory of [[Hugo Grotius]], a lawyer and one of the Remonstrants. Steven Harper states &quot;Wesley does not place the substitionary element primarily within a legal framework...Rather [his doctrine seeks] to bring into proper relationship the 'justice' between God's love for persons and God's hatred of sin...it is not the satisfaction of a legal demand for justice so much as it is an act of mediated reconciliation.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Harper, Steven &quot;Wesleyan Arminianism&quot; ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002) 227ff&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Possibility of apostasy''' &amp;ndash; Wesley fully accepted the Arminian view that genuine Christians could apostatize and lose their salvation, as his famous sermon &quot;A Call to Backsliders&quot; clearly demonstrates. Harper summarizes as follows: &quot;the act of committing sin is not in itself ground for the loss of salvation...the loss of salvation is much more related to experiences that are profound and prolonged. Wesley sees two primary pathways that could result in a permanent fall from grace: unconfessed sin and the actual expression of apostasy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Harper 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley disagrees with Arminius, however, in maintaining that such apostasy was not final. When talking about those who have made &quot;shipwreck&quot; of their faith (1 Tim 1:19), Wesley claims that &quot;not one, or a hundred only, but I am persuaded, several thousands...innumerable are the instances...of those who had fallen but now stand upright.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, John &quot;A Call to Backsliders&quot; ''The Works of John Wesley'', ed. Thomas Jackson, 14 vols. (London: Wesley Methodist Book Room, 1872; repr, Grand Rapids: Baker, 1986) 3:211ff&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Christian perfection]]''' &amp;ndash; According to Wesley's teaching, Christians could attain a state of practical perfection, meaning a lack of all voluntary sin by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, in this life. Christian perfection (or ''entire sanctification''), according to Wesley, is &quot;purity of intention, dedicating all the life to God&quot; and &quot;the mind which was in Christ, enabling us to walk as Christ walked.&quot; It is &quot;loving God with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;xqpwlw&quot;&gt;Wesley, John &quot;A Plain Account of Christian Perfection&quot;, ''Works''&lt;/ref&gt; It is 'a restoration not only to the favour, but likewise to the image of God,&quot; our &quot;being filled with the fullness of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, John &quot;The End of Christ’s Coming&quot;, ''Works''&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley was clear that Christian perfection did not imply perfection of bodily health or an infallibility of judgment. It also does not mean we no longer violate the will of God, for involuntary transgressions remain. Perfected Christians remain subject to temptation, and have continued need to pray for forgiveness and holiness. It is not an absolute perfection but a perfection in love. Furthermore, Wesley did not teach a salvation by perfection, but rather says that, &quot;Even perfect holiness is acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;xqpwlw&quot;/&gt;

===Other variations===
Since the time of Arminius, his name has come to represent a very large variety of beliefs. Some of these beliefs, such as Pelagianism and semi-Pelagianism (see [[Arminianism#Pelagianism|below]]) are not considered to be within Arminian orthodoxy and are dealt with elsewhere. Some doctrines, however, do adhere to the Arminian foundation and, while minority views, are highlighted below.

====Open theism====
{{Main|Open theism}}

The doctrine of open theism states that God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient, but differs on the nature of the future. Open theists claim that the future is not completely knowable because people have not made their decisions yet, and therefore God knows the future in possibilities rather than certainties. As such, open theists resolve the issue of human [[free will]] and God's sovereignty by claiming that God is sovereign because he does not ordain each human choice, but rather works in cooperation with his creation to bring about his will. This notion of sovereignty and freedom is foundational to their understanding of [[love]] since open theists believe that love is not genuine unless it is freely chosen. The power of choice under this definition has the potential for as much harm as it does good, and open theists see free will as the best answer to the [[problem of evil]]. Well-known proponents of this theology are [[Gregory A. Boyd|Greg Boyd]], [[Clark Pinnock]], [[Thomas Jay Oord]], [[William Hasker]], and [[John E. Sanders]].

Some Arminians, such as professor and theologian Robert Picirilli, reject the doctrine of open theism as a &quot;deformed Arminianism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 40 – Picirilli actually objects so strongly to the link between Arminianism and Open theism that he devotes an entire section to his objections. See 59ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Dongell stated that &quot;open theism actually moves beyond classical Arminianism towards [[process theology]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dongell, Joseph and Walls, Jerry ''Why I Am Not a Calvinist'', 45&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some Arminians, like Roger Olson, who believe Open theism to be an alternative view that a Christian can have. The majority Arminian view accepts [[Classical Theism|classical theism]] – the belief that God's power, knowledge, and presence have no external limitations, that is, outside of His divine nature. Most Arminians reconcile human free will with God's sovereignty and foreknowledge by holding three points:
* Human free will is limited by original sin, though God's [[prevenient grace]] restores to humanity the ability to accept God's call of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 42–43, 59ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;
* God purposely exercises his sovereignty in ways that do not illustrate its extent – in other words, He has the power and authority to predetermine salvation but he chooses to apply it through different means.
* God's foreknowledge of the future is exhaustive and complete, and therefore the future is certain and not contingent on human action. God does not determine the future, but He does know it. God's certainty and human contingency are compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 40&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corporate view of election====
{{Further|[[Conditional election]] [[Corporate election]]}}

The majority Arminian view is that election is individual and based on God's foreknowledge of faith, but a second perspective deserves mention. These Arminians reject the concept of individual election entirely, preferring to understand the doctrine in corporate terms. According to this corporate election, God never chose individuals to elect to salvation, but rather He chose to elect the believing church to salvation. Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Ridderbos says &quot;[The certainty of salvation] does not rest on the fact that the church belongs to a certain &quot;number&quot;, but that it belongs to Christ, from before the foundation of the world. Fixity does not lie in a hidden decree, therefore, but in corporate unity of the Church with Christ, whom it has come to know in the gospel and has learned to embrace in faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos, Herman ''Paul: An Outline of His Theology'' trans. John Richard de Witt (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1975), 350–351&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the Old Testament and Jewish law. Indeed most biblical scholarship is in agreement that Judeo-Greco-Roman thought in the 1st century was opposite of the Western world's &quot;individual first&quot; mantra – it was very collectivist or communitarian in nature.&lt;ref name=Abasciano&gt;Abasciano, Brian ''Paul’s Use of the Old Testament in Romans 9:1–9: An Intertextual and Theological Exegesis'' (T&amp;T Clark Publishers, 2006), ISBN 0-567-03073-3&lt;/ref&gt; Identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality.&lt;ref name=Abasciano /&gt; According to Romans 9–11, supporters claim, Jewish election as the chosen people ceased with their national rejection of Jesus as Messiah. As a result of the new covenant, God's chosen people are now the corporate body of Christ, the church (sometimes called ''spiritual Israel'' – see also [[Covenant theology]]). Pastor and theologian Dr. Brian Abasciano claims &quot;What Paul says about Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, whether of their place in God’s plan, or their election, or their salvation, or how they should think or behave, he says from a corporate perspective which views the group as primary and those he speaks about as embedded in the group. These individuals act as members of the group to which they belong, and what happens to them happens by virtue of their membership in the group.&quot;&lt;ref name=Abasciano /&gt;

These scholars also maintain that Jesus was the only human ever elected and that individuals must be &quot;in Christ&quot; (Eph 1:3–4) through faith to be part of the elect. This was, in fact, Swiss Reformed theologian, [[Karl Barth]]'s, understanding of the doctrine of election. Joseph Dongell, professor at Asbury Theological Seminary, states &quot;the most conscipuous feature of Ephesians 1:3–2:10 is the phrase 'in Christ', which occurs twelve times in Ephesians 1:3–4 alone...this means that Jesus Christ himself is the chosen one, the predestined one. Whenever one is incorporated into him by grace through faith, one comes to share in Jesus' special status as chosen of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dongell, Joseph and Walls, Jerry ''Why I am Not a Calvinist'', 76&lt;/ref&gt; Markus Barth illustrates the inter-connectedness: &quot;Election in Christ must be understood as the election of God's people. Only as members of that community do individuals share in the benefits of God's gracious choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Markus ''Ephesians'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1974), 108&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|[[Pelagianism]], [[Semi-Pelagianism]], [[History of Calvinist–Arminian debate]]}}

Understanding Arminianism is aided by understanding the theological alternatives: [[Pelagianism]], [[Semi-Pelagianism]], and [[Calvinism]]. Arminianism, like any major belief system, is frequently misunderstood both by critics and would-be supporters. Listed below are a few common misconceptions.

|}
|}

===Common misconceptions===
* '''Arminianism supports works-based salvation''' – No well-known system of Arminianism denies salvation &quot;by faith alone&quot; and &quot;by faith first to last&quot;. This misconception is often directed at the Arminian possibility of apostasy, which critics maintain requires continual good works to achieve final salvation. To Arminians, however, both initial salvation ''and'' eternal security are &quot;by faith alone&quot;; hence &quot;by faith first ''to last''&quot;. Belief through faith is the condition for entrance into the Kingdom of God; unbelief is the condition for exit from the Kingdom of God – not a lack of good works.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson ''Once Saved, Always Saved?'' 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'' 160ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashby ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' 142ff&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Arminianism is Pelagian (or Semi-Pelagian), denying original sin and total depravity''' – No system of Arminianism founded on Arminius or Wesley denies original sin or total depravity;&lt;ref&gt;Ashby 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; both Arminius and Wesley ''strongly'' affirmed that man's basic condition is one in which he cannot be righteous, understand God, or seek God.&lt;ref&gt;Arminius, ''Writings'' 2:192&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/br&gt;Many Calvinist critics of Arminianism, both historically and currently, claim that Arminianism condones, accepts, or even explicitly supports Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism. Arminius referred to Pelagianism as &quot;the grand falsehood&quot; and stated that he &quot;must confess that I detest, from my heart, the consequences [of that theology].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arminius ''Writings'', II:219ff (the entire treatise occupies pages 196–452)&lt;/ref&gt; David Pawson, a British pastor, decries this association as &quot;libelous&quot; when attributed to Arminius' or Wesley's doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson ''Once Saved, Always Saved?'', 106&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed most Arminians reject all accusations of Pelagianism; nonetheless, primarily due to Calvinist opponents,&lt;ref&gt;Pawson 97–98, 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 6ff&lt;/ref&gt; the two terms remain intertwined in popular usage.

* '''Arminianism denies Jesus' substitutionary payment for sins''' – Both Arminius and Wesley believed in the necessity and sufficiency of Christ's atonement through [[penal substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'' 104–105, 132ff&lt;/ref&gt; Arminius held that God's justice was satisfied [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|individually]],&lt;ref&gt;Ashby ''Four Views on Eternal Security'' 140ff&lt;/ref&gt; while Hugo Grotius and many of Wesley's followers taught that it was satisfied [[Atonement (Governmental view)|governmentally]].&lt;ref&gt;Picirilli ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'' 132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Calvinism===
{{Main|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate}}
Ever since Arminius and his followers revolted against Calvinism in the early 17th century, Protestant soteriology has been largely divided between Calvinism and Arminianism. The extreme of Calvinism is [[hyper-Calvinism]], which insists that signs of election must be sought before evangelization of the unregenerate takes place and that the eternally damned have no obligation to repent and believe, and on the extreme of Arminianism is [[Pelagianism]], which rejects the doctrine of original sin on grounds of moral accountability; but the overwhelming majority of [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] pastors and theologians hold to one of these two systems or somewhere in between.

====Similarities====
*'''[[Total depravity]]''' &amp;ndash; Arminians agree with Calvinists over the doctrine of total [[Total depravity|depravity]]. The differences come in the understanding of how God remedies this human depravity.
*'''[[Substitutionary atonement|Substitutionary effect of atonement]]''' &amp;ndash; Arminians also affirm with Calvinists the substitutionary effect of Christ's [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and that this effect is limited only to the elect. Classical Arminians would agree with Calvinists that this substitution was [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|penal satisfaction]] for all of the elect, while most Wesleyan Arminians would maintain that the substitution was [[Atonement (Governmental view)|governmental]] in nature.

====Differences====
* '''Nature of election''' &amp;ndash; Arminians hold that election to eternal salvation has the [[Conditional election|condition of faith]] attached. The Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]] states that salvation cannot be earned or achieved and is therefore not conditional upon any human effort, so faith is not a condition of salvation but the divinely apportioned means to it. In other words, Arminians believe that they owe their election to their faith, whereas Calvinists believe that they owe their faith to their election.
* '''Nature of grace''' &amp;ndash; Arminians believe that, through [[prevenient grace|grace]], God restores free will concerning salvation to all humanity, and each individual, therefore, is able either to accept the Gospel call through faith or resist it through unbelief. Calvinists hold that God's grace to enable salvation is given only to the elect and [[irresistible grace|irresistibly]] leads to salvation.
* '''Extent of the atonement''' &amp;ndash; Arminians, along with four-point Calvinists or [[Amyraldian]]s, hold to a universal drawing and [[Unlimited atonement|universal extent of atonement]] instead of the Calvinist doctrine that the drawing and atonement is [[limited atonement|limited in extent]] to the elect only, which many Calvinists prefer to call '[[limited atonement|particular redemption]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/sermons/0181.htm Spurgeon, Charles Haddon]&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides (with the exception of hyper-Calvinists) believe the invitation of the gospel is universal and &quot;must be presented to everyone [they] can reach without any distinction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicole, Roger, [http://www.apuritansmind.com/Arminianism/NicoleRogerUniversalCallDefiniteAtonement.htm &quot;Covenant, Universal Call And Definite Atonement&quot;] ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 38:3 (September 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Perseverance in faith''' &amp;ndash; Arminians believe that future salvation and eternal life is secured in Christ and protected from all external forces but is [[conditional preservation of the saints|conditional on remaining in Christ]] and can be lost through [[apostasy]]. Traditional Calvinists believe in the doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]], which says that because God chose some unto salvation and actually paid for their particular sins, he keeps them from apostasy and that those who do apostatize were never truly regenerated (that is, [[Born again Christianity|born again]]) or saved. Non-traditional Calvinists and other evangelicals advocate the similar but different doctrine of eternal security that teaches if a person was once saved, his or her salvation can never be in jeopardy, even if the person completely apostatizes.

'''The Alan Parsons Project''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[progressive rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]], active between 1975 and 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanparsonsmusic.com/bio.php Alan Parsons - Bio FAQ Discography]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of [[Eric Woolfson]] and [[Alan Parsons]] surrounded by a varying number of session musicians.

Behind the revolving lineup and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson. Woolfson was a lawyer by profession, but also a composer and pianist. Parsons was a successful producer and accomplished engineer. Almost all songs on the band's albums are credited to &quot;Woolfson/Parsons&quot;.

==History==
[[England|Englishman]] [[Alan Parsons]] met [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Eric Woolfson]] in the canteen of [[Abbey Road Studios]] in the summer of 1974. Parsons had already acted as assistant engineer on [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be]]'', had recently engineered [[Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd's]] ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', and had produced several acts for EMI Records.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Woolfson, a songwriter and composer, was working as a session pianist; he had also composed material for a concept album idea based on the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/history-read-more.html History @ The-alan-parsons-project.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons asked Woolfson to become his manager and Woolfson managed Parsons' career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes including [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]], [[Steve Harley]], [[Cockney Rebel]], [[John Miles]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]] and [[The Hollies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Parsons commented at the time that he felt frustrated in having to accommodate the views of some of the musicians, which he felt interfered with his production. Woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the [[film industry]], where directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]] were the focal point of the film's promotion, rather than individual film stars. If the film industry was becoming a director's medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer's medium.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Recalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons' respective talents. Parsons would produce and engineer songs written by the two, and the Alan Parsons Project was born. Their first album, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'', including major contributions by all members of Pilot and [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], was a success, reaching the [[Top 40]] in the [[United States|US]] [[Billboard 200]] [[record chart|chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; The song &quot;[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]&quot; featured lead vocals by the actor [[Leonard Whiting]], and, according to the 2007 remastered album liner notes, was the first rock song to use a [[digital]] [[vocoder]], with Alan Parsons speaking [[lyrics]] through it.

[[Arista Records]] then signed The Alan Parsons Project for further albums. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the group's popularity continued to grow (although they were always more popular in [[North America]] and [[Continental Europe]] than in their home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album). The [[single (music)|singles]] &quot;I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You&quot;, &quot;[[Games People Play (Alan Parsons Project song)|Games People Play]]&quot;, &quot;Dammed If I Do&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; (Woolfson's first lead vocal), &quot;[[Eye in the Sky (song)|Eye in the Sky]]&quot; and &quot;[[Don't Answer Me]]&quot; had a notable impact on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. After those successes, however, the group began to fade from view.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; There were fewer hit singles, and declining album sales. 1987's ''[[Gaudi (album)|Gaudi]]'' was the Project's last release, though they planned to record an album called ''[[Freudiana]]'' next.

Although the studio version of ''Freudiana'' was produced by Parsons (and featured the regular Project backing musicians, making it an 'unofficial' Project album), it was primarily Woolfson's idea to turn it into a musical. This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music. ''[[Freudiana]]'', ''Gaudi'' and ''Gambler'' were three musicals that included some Project songs like &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot;, and &quot;Limelight&quot;. The live music from ''Gambler'' was only distributed at the performance site in [[Moenchengladbach]], [[Germany]].

In 1981,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadkill.com/~ajy/scrapbook/001.html Roadkill.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, Woolfson and their [[record label]] Arista, were stalled in contract renegotiations when on 5 March the two submitted an all-instrumental atonal album tentatively titled '[[The Sicilian Defence]]' (the name of an aggressive opening move in chess), arguably to get out of their [[recording contract]]. Arista's refusal to release the album had two known effects: the negotiations led to a renewed contract and the album was never released.

{{quote|&quot;The Sicilian Defense was our attempt at quickly fulfilling our contractual obligation after ''I Robot'', ''Pyramid'' and ''Eve'' had been delivered. The album was rejected by Arista, not surprisingly, and we then renegotiated our deal for the future and the next album, ''The Turn of a Friendly Card''. The Sicilian Defense album was never released and never will be, if I have anything to do with it. I have not heard it since it was finished. I hope the tapes no longer exist.&quot;|Alan Parsons&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanparsonsmusic.com/interviews.php Alanparsonsmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In interviews made before his 2009 death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/EricWoolfson?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=192291343290 Eric Woolfson on Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt; Woolfson said he planned to release one track from the &quot;Sicilian&quot; album, which in 2008 appeared as a bonus track on a CD re-issue of the ''[[Eve (album)|Eve]]'' album.

Parsons released titles under his name (''[[Try Anything Once]]'', ''[[On Air]]'', ''[[The Time Machine (Alan Parsons album)|The Time Machine]]'', and ''[[A Valid Path]]''), while Woolfson made [[concept album]]s named ''[[Freudiana]]'' (about [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[psychology]]) and ''[[Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (continuing from the Alan Parsons Project's first album about Edgar Allan Poe's literature).

''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'' was first [[remix]]ed in 1987 for release on [[Compact disc|CD]], and included narration by [[Orson Welles]] which had been recorded in 1975, but arrived too late to be included on the original album. On the 2007 deluxe edition release, it is revealed that parts of this tape were used for the 1976 Griffith Park Planetarium launch of the original album, the 1987 remix, and various radio spots, all of which were included as bonus material.

==The ''Project sound''==
Most of the Project's titles, especially the early work, share common traits (likely influenced by [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', on which Parsons was the [[audio engineer]] in 1973). They were [[concept album]]s, and typically began with an [[instrumental]] introduction which faded into the first song, often had an instrumental piece in the middle of the second [[gramophone record|LP]] side, and concluded with a quiet, melancholic, or powerful song. The opening instrumental was largely done away with by 1980; no later Project album except ''[[Eye in the Sky (album)|Eye in the Sky]]'' featured one (although every album includes at least one instrumental somewhere in the running order). The instrumental on that album, &quot;Sirius&quot;, eventually became the best-known (or at least most frequently heard) Parsons instrumental. It was used as entrance music by various [[United States|American]] sports teams, most notably by the [[Chicago Bulls]] during their 1990s [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]]. It was also used as the entrance theme for [[Ricky Steamboat]] in pro wrestling of the mid 1980s.  In addition, Sirius has been played in a variety of TV shows and movies including the episode &quot;Vanishing Act&quot; of ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', and the 2009 film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]''.

The group was notable for using several vocal performers instead of having a single lead vocalist. Lead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their vocal style to complement each song. Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits (including &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;) and the record company pressured Parsons to use him more, but Parsons preferred &quot;real&quot; singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not. In addition to Woolfson, [[Chris Rainbow]], [[Lenny Zakatek]], [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]], [[David Paton]] and [[The Zombies]]' [[Colin Blunstone]] made regular appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Other singers, such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Procol Harum]]'s [[Gary Brooker]], [[Elmer Gantry’s Velvet Opera|Dave Terry aka Elmer Gantry]], [[Vitamin Z]]'s Geoff Barradale and [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]]'s Dean Ford, have recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons himself only sang lead on one song (&quot;The Raven&quot;) through a vocoder, and can be heard singing [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]] on a few others, including &quot;To One in Paradise&quot;. Both of those songs appeared on ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''.

Although the vocalists varied, a small number of musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly. These core musicians contributed to the recognizable style of a Project song in spite of the varied singer lineup. Together with Parsons and Woolfson, the Project originally consisted of the group Pilot, with [[Ian Bairnson]] (guitar), [[David Paton]] (bass) and [[Stuart Tosh]] (drums).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Pilot's keyboardist [[Billy Lyall]] also contributed. From ''Pyramid'' onwards, Tosh was replaced by [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] of [[Cockney Rebel]]. Bairnson played on all albums and Paton stayed almost until the end. [[Andrew Powell]] appeared as arranger of orchestra (and often choirs) on all albums except ''Vulture Culture'', when he was composing the [[film score|score]] of [[Richard Donner]]'s film ''[[Ladyhawke]]''. This score was partly in the Project style, recorded by most of the Project regulars, and produced and engineered by Parsons. Powell also composed some material for the first two Project albums. From ''Vulture Culture'' onwards, Richard Cottle played as a regular member on synthesizers and saxophone.

[[Image:Alan Parsons live.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Alan Parsons Live Project, June 1998 (distinct from The Alan Parsons Project live).]]
Except for one occasion, the Project never played live during its original incarnation. This was because Woolfson and Parsons saw themselves mainly in the roles of writing and production, and also because of the technical difficulties of reproducing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio. In the 1990s things changed with the technology of [[digital sampler]]s. The one occasion where the band was introduced as &quot;The Alan Parsons Project&quot; in a live performance was at [[Night of the Proms]] 1990 (at the time of the group's break-up), featuring all Project regulars except Woolfson who was present but behind the scenes, while Parsons stayed at the mixer except during the last song, where he played acoustic guitar.

Since 1994, a new version of the band has toured, with Parsons performing live acoustic guitar, keyboards and vocals, with various lineups. This latest incarnation is called the '''Alan Parsons Live Project''', the name distinct from &quot;The Alan Parsons Project&quot;, due to founder Parsons' break-up with Woolfson.

According to [[SonyBMG]], there are no plans to release ''The Sicilian Defence''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{See also|Generic property}}
In [[mathematics]], the phrase '''&quot;almost all&quot;''' has a number of specialised uses.

&quot;Almost all&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;all but [[finite set|finite]]ly many&quot; (formally, a [[cofinite]] set) or &quot;all but a [[countable set]]&quot; (formally, a [[cocountable]] set); see [[almost]].

A simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd. (Two is a prime number.)

When speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes it means &quot;all reals but a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero&quot; (formally, [[almost everywhere]]). In this sense almost all reals are not a member of the [[Cantor set]] even though the Cantor set is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].

In [[number theory]], if ''P''(''n'') is a property of positive [[integer]]s, and if ''p''(''N'') denotes the number of [[positive integers]] ''n'' less than ''N'' for which ''P''(''n'') holds, and if 

:''p''(''N'')/''N'' → 1 as ''N'' → ∞

(see [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]), then we say that &quot;''P''(''n'') holds for almost all positive integers ''n''&quot; (formally, [[asymptotically almost surely]]) and write
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall^\infty n) P(n).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[prime number theorem]] states that the number of [[prime numbers]] less than or equal to ''N'' is asymptotically equal to ''N''/ln ''N''. Therefore the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln ''N'', which tends to 0. Thus, ''almost all'' positive integers are [[composite number|composite]] (not prime), however there are still an infinite number of primes.

Occasionally, &quot;almost all&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;[[almost everywhere]]&quot; in [[measure theory]], or in the closely related sense of &quot;[[almost surely]]&quot; in [[probability theory]].

An '''aromatic hydrocarbon''' or '''arene'''&lt;ref&gt;Definition IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/A00435.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; (or sometimes '''aryl hydrocarbon''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://diss.kib.ki.se/2003/91-7349-549-2/thesis.pdf Mechanisms of Activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor] by Maria Backlund, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[hydrocarbon]] characterized by general alternating double and single bonds between carbons. The term 'aromatic' was assigned before the physical mechanism determining [[aromaticity]] was discovered, and was derived from the fact that many of the compounds have a sweet scent. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a [[benzene|benzene ring]], after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, [[benzene]]. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ''monocyclic'' (MAH) or ''polycyclic'' (PAH). 

Some non-benzene-based compounds called '''heteroarenes''', which follow [[Hückel's rule]], are also aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the [[heteroatom]]s [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[sulfur]].   Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are [[furan]], a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes an oxygen atom, and [[pyridine]], a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-aromatic.html HighBeam Encyclopedia: aromatic compound] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Benzene ring model ==
[[image:Benzene circle.svg|100px|right|thumb| [[Benzene]] ]]

{{main|aromaticity}}
[[Benzene]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and was recognized as the first aromatic hydrocarbon, with the nature of its bonding first being recognized by [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz]] in the 19th century.  
Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighboring carbons. This leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.

The structure is also illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show  six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This also represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds all of [[bond order]] ~1.5. This equivalency is well explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat. 

General properties:
# Display [[aromaticity]]. 
# The carbon-hydrogen ratio is high.
# They burn with a sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon-hydrogen ratio.
# They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]s.

The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison &amp; Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated, it is used to describe any cyclic pi system in some publications, or only those pi systems that obey [[Hückel's rule]] on others. Jensen &lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of the Circle Symbol for Aromaticity'' by William B. Jensen 424
Journal of Chemical Education  Vol. 86 No. 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; argues that in line with Robinson's original proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 pi-electron systems. In this way the circle symbol for a 6c–6e bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a [[3c–2e bond]].

==Arene synthesis==
A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an '''aromatization'''. Many laboratory methods exist for the [[organic synthesis]] of arenes from non-arene precursors. Many methods rely on [[cycloaddition]] reactions. [[Alkyne trimerization]] describes the [2+2+2] cyclization of three alkynes, in the [[Dötz reaction]] an alkyne, carbon monoxide and a chromium carbene complex are the reactants.[[Diels-Alder reaction]]s of [[alkyne]]s with [[pyrone]] or [[cyclopentadienone]] with expulsion of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds. In [[Bergman cyclization]] the reactants are an [[enyne]] plus a hydrogen donor. 

Another set of methods is the aromatization of [[cyclohexane]]s and other aliphatic rings: reagents are catalysts used in [[hydrogenation]] such as platinum, palladium and nickel (reverse hydrogenation), [[quinone]]s and the elements [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry March Advanced Organic Chemistry 3Ed., ISBN 0-471-85472-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arene reactions==
Arenes are reactants in many organic reactions.
===Aromatic substitution===
In aromatic substitution one [[substituent]] on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another substituent. The two main types are [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] when the active reagent is an electrophile and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] when the reagent is a nucleophile. In [[radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] the active reagent is a radical. An example is the nitration of [[salicylic acid]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite DOI|10.1016/0040-4039(95)00281-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
:[[File:Synthesis 5-Nitrosalicylic acid.svg|400px|Nitration of salicylic acid]]

===Coupling reactions===
In [[coupling reaction]]s a metal catalyses a coupling between two formal radical fragments. Common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new [[carbon-carbon bond]]s e.g. alkylarenes, vinyl arenes, biraryls, new [[carbon-nitrogen bond]]s (anilines) or new [[carbon-oxygen bond]]s (aryloxy compounds). An example is the direct arylation of perfluorobenzenes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite DOI|10.1021/ja062509l}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[File:Fagnou fluoroarene coupling2.svg|600px|Coupling reaction]] 
===Hydrogenation===
[[Hydrogenation]] of arenes create saturated rings. The compound [[Naphthol|1-naphthol]] is completely reduced to a mixture of [[decalin]]-ol [[isomer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.371 (1988); Vol. 51, p.103 (1971). http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV6P0371.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[Image:NaphtolHydrogenation.svg|500px|1-naphthol hydrogenation]]
The compound [[resorcinol]], hydrogenated with [[Raney nickel]] in presence of aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] forms an [[enolate]] which is alkylated with [[methyl iodide]] to ''2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexandione'':&lt;ref&gt;Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.743 (1973); Vol. 41, p.56 (1961). http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV5P0567.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cycloaddition]] reaction are not common. Unusual thermal Diels-Alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the [[Wagner-Jauregg reaction]]. Other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through [[excimer]]s.

== Benzene and derivatives of benzene ==
Benzene derivatives have from one to six [[substituent]]s attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are [[phenol]], which carries a [[hydroxyl]] group and [[toluene]] with a [[methyl]] group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring,  their spatial relationship becomes important for which the [[arene substitution patterns]] ''ortho'', ''meta'', and ''para'' are devised. For example, three [[isomer]]s exist for [[cresol]] because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other (ortho), one position removed from each other (meta), or two positions removed from each other (para). [[Xylenol]] has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.

The arene ring has an ability to stabilize charges. This is seen in, for example, phenol (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-OH), which is [[acidic]] at the hydroxyl (OH), since a charge on this oxygen (alkoxide -O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt;) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring.

'''Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons''' ('''PAH'''s), also known as '''polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons''' or '''polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons''', are potent atmospheric pollutants that consist of fused [[aromatic]] [[simple aromatic ring|rings]] and do not contain [[heteroatom]]s or carry [[substituent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Fetzer |first = J. C. |title = The Chemistry and Analysis of the Large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons |year = 2000 |doi=10.1080/10406630701268255 |isbn = 0471363545|publisher = Wiley |location = New York |journal = Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds |volume = 27 |issue = 2 |pages = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naphthalene]] is the simplest example of a PAH.  PAHs occur in [[oil]], [[coal]], and [[tar]] deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As a pollutant, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic, and [[teratogen]]ic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |publisher=European Commission, Scientific Committee on Food|date=December 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B. K. |year=1983 |title=Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in grilled food |journal=J Agric Food Chem. |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=867–873 |pmid=6352775 |doi=10.1021/jf00118a049 |last2=Sahlberg |first2=GP |last3=Eriksson |first3=AT |last4=Busk |first4=LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=121&amp;tid=25 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) |year=1996 |publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also found in the [[interstellar medium]], in [[comet]]s, and in [[meteorite]]s and are a [[PAH world hypothesis|candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life]]. In [[graphene]] the PAH motif is extended to large 2D sheets.

===Occurrence and pollution===
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are [[lipophilic]], meaning they mix more easily with oil than water. The larger compounds are less water-soluble and less [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] (i.e., less prone to evaporate). Because of these properties, PAHs in the environment are found primarily in [[soil]], sediment and oily substances, as opposed to in water or air. However, they are also a component of concern in [[particulate matter]] suspended in air.

Natural crude oil and coal deposits contain significant amounts of PAHs, arising from chemical conversion of natural product molecules, such as steroids, to aromatic hydrocarbons. They are also found in processed fossil fuels, [[tar]] and various edible oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nmmpK0oDE20C&amp;pg=PA125 |page=125 |title=Activated carbon applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries |author=Glenn Michael Roy |publisher=CRC Press |year=1995 |isbn=1566761980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAHs are one of the most widespread organic pollutants. In addition to their presence in fossil fuels they are also formed by incomplete [[combustion]] of [[carbon]]-containing fuels such as [[wood]], [[coal]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[fat]], [[tobacco]], and [[incense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Incense link to cancer |curly=y |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2001-08-02 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1467409.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of combustion yield different distributions of PAHs in both relative amounts of individual PAHs and in which [[isomer]]s are produced. Thus, coal burning produces a different mixture than motor-fuel combustion or a forest fire, making the compounds potentially useful as indicators of the burning history. Hydrocarbon emissions from fossil fuel-burning engines are regulated in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, EPA regulations for small engines are at 40 CFR §90.103; see [[emission standard]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of PAHs===
Although the health effects of individual PAHs are not exactly alike, the following 17 PAHs are considered as a group in this profile issued by the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ ATSDR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health===
PAHs toxicity is very structurally dependent, with isomers (PAHs with the same formula and number of rings) varying from being nontoxic to being extremely toxic. Thus, highly carcinogenic PAHs may be small or large. One PAH compound, [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], is notable for being the first chemical carcinogen to be discovered (and is one of many carcinogens found in [[Chemicals in a cigarette|cigarette smoke]]). The EPA has classified seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: [[benz(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']fluoranthene]], [[chrysene]], [[dibenz(a,h)anthracene]], and [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]].

PAHs known for their [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic and [[teratogen]]ic properties are [[benz(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]] and [[chrysene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(j)fluoranthene|benzo[''j'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[benzo(ghi)perylene|benzo[''ghi'']perylene]], [[coronene]], [[dibenz(a,h)anthracene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;), [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ovalene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luch, A.|year=2005|title=The Carcinogenic Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons|place=London|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-417-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High prenatal exposure to PAH is associated with lower IQ and childhood asthma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/07/20/exposure-to-common-pollutant-in-womb-might-lower-iq.html Exposure to Common Pollutant in Womb Might Lower IQ]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Center for Children's Environmental Health reports studies that demonstrate that exposure to PAH pollution during pregnancy is related to adverse birth outcomes including low birth weight, premature delivery, and heart malformations.  Cord blood of exposed babies shows DNA damage that has been linked to cancer.  Follow-up studies show a higher level of developmental delays at age three, lower scores on IQ tests and increased behaviorial problems at ages six and eight.&lt;ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
The simplest PAHs, as defined by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) (G.P Moss, IUPAC nomenclature for fused-ring systems), are [[phenanthrene]] and [[anthracene]], which both contain three fused aromatic rings. Smaller molecules, such as [[benzene]], are not PAHs.

PAHs may contain four-, five-, six- or seven-member rings, but those with five or six are most common. PAHs composed only of six-membered rings are called '''alternant''' PAHs. Certain alternant PAHs are called '''benzenoid''' PAHs. The name comes from [[benzene]], an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] with a single, six-membered ring. These can be benzene rings interconnected with each other by single carbon-carbon bonds and with no rings remaining that do not contain a complete benzene ring.

The set of alternant PAHs is closely related to a set of mathematical entities called [[polyhex (mathematics)|polyhex]]es, which are planar figures composed by conjoining regular [[hexagon]]s of identical size.

PAHs containing up to six fused aromatic rings are often known as &quot;small&quot; PAHs, and those containing more than six aromatic rings are called &quot;large&quot; PAHs. Due to the availability of samples of the various small PAHs, the bulk of research on PAHs has been of those of up to six rings. The biological activity and occurrence of the large PAHs does appear to be a continuation of the small PAHs. They are found as combustion products, but at lower levels than the small PAHs due to the kinetic limitation of their production through addition of successive rings. In addition, with many more isomers possible for larger PAHs, the occurrence of specific structures is much smaller.

PAHs possess very characteristic [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV absorbance spectra]]. These often possess many absorbance bands and are unique for each ring structure. Thus, for a set of [[isomer]]s, each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also [[fluorescent]], emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting [[semiconductor|semi-conducting]] and other behaviors.

[[Naphthalene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; constituent of [[mothball]]s), consisting of two coplanar six-membered rings sharing an edge, is another aromatic hydrocarbon. By formal convention, it is not a true PAH, though is referred to as a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

Aqueous solubility decreases approximately one order of magnitude for each additional ring.

&lt;/center&gt;
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has designated 32 PAH compounds as priority pollutants. The original 16 are listed. They are [[naphthalene]], [[acenaphthylene]], [[acenaphthene]], [[fluorene]], [[phenanthrene]], [[anthracene]], [[fluoranthene]], [[pyrene]], [[benzo(a)anthracene|benzo[''a'']anthracene]], [[chrysene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']flouranthene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[dibenz(ah)anthracene]], [[benzo(ghi)perylene|benzo[''ghi'']perylene]], and [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]]. This list of the 16 EPA priority PAHs is often targeted for measurement in environmental samples.

===Aromaticity===
Although PAHs clearly are aromatic compounds, the degree of [[aromaticity]] can be different for each ring segment. According to '''Clar's rule''' (formulated by Erich Clar in 1964)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clar, E. (Erich) |year=1964 |title=Polycyclic Hydrocarbons |place=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]]. [http://lccn.loc.gov/63012392 LCCN 63012392]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for PAHs the [[resonance structure]] with the most disjoint aromatic п-sextets—i.e. benzene-like moieties—is the most important for the characterization of the properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/poc.938|title=Assessment of Clar's aromatic π-sextet rule by means of PDI, NICS and HOMA indicators of local aromaticity|year=2005|last1=Portella|first1=Guillem|last2=Poater|first2=Jordi|last3=Solà|first3=Miquel|journal=Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry|volume=18 |issue=8|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in [[phenanthrene]] ('''1''') one Clar structure has two sextets at the extremities, while the other resonance structure has just one central sextet. Therefore in this molecule the outer rings are firmly aromatic while its central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive. In contrast, in [[anthracene]] ('''2''') the number of sextets is just one and aromaticity spreads out. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the UV absorbance spectra of these two isomers. [[Phenanthrene]] has a highest wavelength absorbance around 290&amp;nbsp;nm, while [[anthracene]] has highest wavelength bands around 380&amp;nbsp;nm. Three Clar structures with two sextets are present in [[chrysene]] ('''3''') and by superposition the aromaticity in the outer ring is larger than in the inner rings. Another relevant Clar hydrocarbon is [[zethrene]].

===Origins of life===
{{main|PAH world hypothesis}}
In January 2004 (at the 203rd Meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]]), it was reported&lt;ref name=&quot;Battersby&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=S. |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a team led by A. Witt of the [[University of Toledo|University of Toledo, Ohio]] studied ultraviolet light emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] and found the spectral signatures of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]] (no other such complex molecules had ever before been found in space). This discovery was considered as a controversial&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|year=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. Witt and his team inferred&lt;ref name=&quot;Battersby&quot;/&gt; that since they discovered PAHs—which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth—in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  More recently, [[fullerenes]] (or &quot;[[buckyballs]]&quot;), have been detected in other nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39 |title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planatary Nebulae |last1=García-Hernández|first1=D.

===Detection===
Detection of PAHs in materials is often done using [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] or [[liquid chromatography]] with [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-visible]] or [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]] spectroscopic methods or by using rapid test PAH indicator strips.

An '''abbey''' (from [[Latin]] ''abbatia,'' derived from [[Latin language]] ''abbatia,'' from Latin ''abbās'',&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ernest, Dr., ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', vol I, A-K, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1969, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; derived from [[Aramaic language]] ''abba,'' &quot;father&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ernest, Dr., ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language'', Carta Jerusalem, The University of Haifa, 1987,p.1&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Catholic]] '''[[monastery]]''' or '''[[convent]]''', under the authority of an [[Abbot]] or an [[Abbess]], who serves as the spiritual father or mother of the community.

The term can also refer to an establishment which has long ceased to function as an abbey, but continues to carry the name — in some cases for centuries (for example, see [[Abbey#Westminster Abbey|Westminster Abbey]] below).

==Origins==
The earliest known Christian monastic communities (see [[Monasticism]]) consisted of groups of cells or huts collected about a common center, which was usually the house of some hermit or [[anchorite]] famous for holiness or singular asceticism, but without any attempt at orderly arrangement. This arrangement probably followed the example set in part by the [[Essenes]] in [[Judea]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

In the earliest age of Christian [[monasticism]] the [[ascetic]]s were accustomed to live singly, independent of one another, not far from some village church, supporting themselves by the labour of their own hands, and distributing the surplus after the supply of their own scanty wants to the poor. Increasing religious fervour, aided by persecution, drove them farther and farther away from the civilization into mountain solitudes or lonely deserts. The deserts of Egypt swarmed with the &quot;cells&quot; or huts of these anchorites. [[Anthony the Great]], who had retired to the Egyptian [[Thebaid]] during the persecution of [[Maximian]], AD 312, was the most celebrated among them for his austerities, his sanctity, and his power as an exorcist. His fame collected round him a host of followers imitating his asceticism in an attempt to imitate his sanctity. The deeper he withdrew into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples became. They refused to be separated from him, and built their cells round that of their spiritual father. Thus arose the first monastic community, consisting of anchorites living each in his own little dwelling, united together under one superior. Anthony, as [[Johann August Wilhelm Neander]] remarks,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venables|1911}} cites  ''Church History'', iii. p. 316, Clark's translation.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;without any conscious design of his own, had become the founder of a new mode of living in common, [[Cenobitic|Coenobitism]].&quot; By degrees order was introduced in the groups of huts. They were arranged in lines like the tents in an encampment, or the houses in a street. From this arrangement these lines of single cells came to be known as Laurae, Laurai, &quot;streets&quot; or &quot;lanes&quot;.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The real founder of [[cenobitic]] (''koinos,'' common, and ''bios,'' life) monasteries in the modern sense was [[Pachomius]], an Egyptian of the beginning of the 4th century. The first community established by him was at [[Tabennae]], an island of the [[Nile]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Eight others were founded in the region during his lifetime, numbering 3,000 monks. Within fifty years from his death his societies could claim 50,000 members. These coenobia resembled villages, peopled by a hard-working religious community, all of one sex.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The buildings were detached, small and of the humblest character. Each cell or hut, according to [[Sozomen]], contained three monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venables|1911}} cites Sozomen H.R. iii. 14&lt;/ref&gt; They took their chief meal in a common [[refectory]] or dining hall at 3 P.M., up to which hour they usually fasted. They ate in silence, with hoods so drawn over their faces that they could see nothing but what was on the table before them. The monks spent the time not devoted to religious services or study in manual labour.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Palladius]], who visited the Egyptian monasteries about the close of the 4th century, found among the 300 members of the coenobium of [[Panopolis]], under the [[Pachomius|Pachomian]] rule, 15 tailors, 7 smiths, 4 carpenters, 12 cameldrivers and 15 tanners. Each separate community had its own [[oeconomus]] or steward, who was subject to a chief steward stationed at the head establishment. All the produce of the monks' labour was committed to him, and by him shipped to [[Alexandria]]. The money raised by the sale was expended in the purchase of stores for the support of the communities, and what was over was devoted to charity. Twice in the year the superiors of the several [[coenobia]] met at the chief monastery, under the presidency of an archimandrite (&quot;the chief of the fold,&quot; from ''miandra'', a sheepfold), and at the last meeting gave in reports of their administration for the year. The coenobia of Syria belonged to the Pachomian institution. We learn many details concerning those in the vicinity of [[Antioch]] from [[Chrysostom]]'s writings. The monks lived in separate huts, ''kalbbia,'' forming a religious hamlet on the mountain side. They were subject to an abbot, and observed a common rule. (They had no refectory, but ate their common meal, of bread and water only, when the day's labour was over, reclining on strewn grass, sometimes out of doors.) Four times in the day they joined in [[prayer]]s and [[psalms]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

=== Great Lavra, Mount Athos ===
The necessity for defence from attacks (for monastic houses tended to accumulate rich gifts), economy of space and convenience of access from one part of the community to another, by degrees dictated a more compact and orderly arrangement of the buildings of a monastic coenobium. Large piles of building were erected, with strong outside walls, capable of resisting the assaults of an enemy, within which all the necessary edifices were ranged round one or more open courts, usually surrounded with [[cloister]]s. The usual Eastern arrangement is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the [[Great Lavra]], [[Mount Athos]]. &lt;br /&gt;

This monastery, like the oriental monasteries generally, is surrounded by a strong and lofty blank stone wall, enclosing an area of between 3 and 4 acres (12,000 and 16,000 m²). The longer side extends to a length of about {{convert|500|ft|m}}. There is only one main entrance, on the north side (A), defended by three separate iron doors. Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant feature in the monasteries of the Levant. There is a small [[postern]] gate at L. The [[enceinte]] comprises two large open courts, surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone. The outer court, which is much the larger, contains the granaries and storehouses (K), and the kitchen (H) and other offices connected with the refectory (G). Immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two-storied guest-house, opening from a cloister (C). The inner court is surrounded by a cloister (EE), from which open the monks' cells (II). In the centre of this court stands the [[catholicon]] or conventual church, a square building with an apse of the
cruciform domical Byzantine type, approached by a domed [[narthex]]. In front of the church stands a marble fountain (F), covered by a dome supported on columns. Opening from the western side of the cloister, but actually standing in the outer court, is the refectory (G), a large cruciform building, about 100 feet (30 m) each way, decorated within with frescoes of saints. At the upper end is a semicircular recess, recalling the triclinium of the Lateran Palace at Rome, in which is placed the seat of the hegumenos or abbot. This apartment is chiefly used as a hall of meeting, the oriental monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==Benedictine monasteries==
Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development to [[Benedict of Nursia]] (born AD 480). His rule was diffused with miraculous rapidity from the parent foundation on [[Monte Cassino]] through the whole of [[western Europe]], and every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and splendour. Few great towns in Italy were without their Benedictine convent, and they quickly rose in all the great centres of population in England, [[France]] and [[Spain]]. The number of these monasteries founded between AD 520 and 700 is amazing. Before the [[Council of Constance]], AD 1415, no fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this [[order (religious)|order]] alone. The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan, modified where necessary (as at Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand close to the steep bank of a river) to accommodate the arrangement to local circumstances.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

We have no existing examples of the earlier monasteries of the Benedictine order. They have all yielded to the ravages of time and the violence of man. But we have preserved to us an elaborate plan of the great Swiss monastery of St Gall, erected about AD 820, which puts us in possession of the whole arrangements of a monastery of the first class towards the early part of the 9th century. This curious and interesting plan has been made the subject of a memoir both by [[Keller]] ([[Zurich]], 1844) and by Professor [[Robert Willis (architect)|Robert Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venables|1911}} cites Willis ''Arch. Journal,'' 1848, vol. v. pp.&amp;nbsp;86–117.&lt;/ref&gt; To the latter we are indebted for the substance of the following description, as well as for the plan, reduced from his elucidated transcript of the original preserved in the archives of the convent. The general appearance of the convent is that of a town of isolated houses with streets running between them. It is evidently planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule, which enjoined that, if possible, the monastery should contain within itself every necessary of life, as well as the buildings more intimately connected with the religious and social life of its inmates. It should comprise a [[mill (factory)|mill]], a [[bakehouse]], [[stable]]s, and [[cattle|cow]]-houses, together with accommodation for carrying on all necessary mechanical arts within the walls, so as to obviate the necessity of the monks going outside its limits.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Image:Jumièges.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Abbey of [[Jumièges Abbey|Jumièges]], [[Normandy]]]]
The general distribution of the buildings may be thus described:-The church, with its cloister to the south, occupies the centre of a quadrangular area, about {{convert|430|ft|m}} square. The buildings, as in all great monasteries, are distributed into groups. The church forms the nucleus, as the centre of the religious life of the community. In closest connection with the church is the group of buildings appropriated to the monastic line and its daily requirements---the refectory for eating, the dormitory for sleeping, the common room for social intercourse, the chapter-house for religious and disciplinary conference. These essential elements of monastic life are ranged about a cloister court, surrounded by a covered arcade, affording communication sheltered from the elements between the various buildings. The infirmary for sick monks, with the physician's house and physic garden, lies to the east. In the same group with the infirmary is the school for the novices. The outer school, with its headmaster's house against the opposite wall of the church, stands outside the convent enclosure, in close proximity to the abbot's house, that he might have a constant eye over them. The buildings devoted to hospitality are divided into three groups,--one for the reception of distinguished guests, another for monks visiting the monastery, a third for poor travellers and pilgrims. The first and third are placed to the right and left of the common entrance of the monastery,---the hospitium for distinguished guests being placed on the north side of the church, not far from the abbot's house; that for the poor on the south side next to the farm buildings. The monks are lodged in a guest-house built against the north wall of the church. The group of buildings connected with the material wants of the establishment is placed to the south and west of the church, and is distinctly separated from the monastic buildings. The kitchen, buttery and offices are reached by a passage from the west end of the refectory, and are connected with the bakehouse and brewhouse, which are placed still farther away. The whole of the southern and western sides is devoted to workshops, stables and farm-buildings. The buildings, with some exceptions, seem to have been of one story only, and all but the church were probably erected of wood. The whole includes thirty-three separate blocks. The church (D) is cruciform, with a nave of nine bays, and a semicircular apse at either extremity. That to the west is surrounded by a semicircular colonnade, leaving an open &quot;paradise&quot; (E) between it and the wall of the church. The whole area is divided by screens into various chapels. The high altar (A) stands immediately to the east of the transept, or ritual choir; the altar of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] (B) in the eastern, and that of [[St Peter]] (C) in the western apse. A cylindrical campanile stands detached from the church on either side of the western apse (FF).{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

church has on its east side the &quot;[[pisalis]]&quot; or &quot;[[calefactory]]&quot;, (H), the common sitting-room of the brethren, warmed by flues beneath the floor. On this side in later monasteries we invariably find the [[chapter house]], the absence of which in this plan is somewhat surprising. It appears, however, from the inscriptions on the plan itself, that the north walk of the cloisters served for the purposes of a chapter-house, and was fitted up with benches on the long sides. Above the calefactory is the &quot;[[dormitory]]&quot; opening into the south transept of the church, to enable the monks to attend the nocturnal services with readiness. A passage at the other end leads to the &quot;[[necessarium]]&quot; (I), a portion of the monastic buildings always planned with extreme care. The southern side is occupied by the &quot;refectory&quot; (K), from the west end of which by a vestibule the kitchen (L) is reached. This is separated from the main buildings of the monastery, and is connected by a long passage with a building containing the bake house and brew house (M), and the sleeping-rooms of the servants. The upper story of the refectory is the &quot;vestiarium,&quot; where the ordinary clothes of the brethren were kept. On the western side of the cloister is another two story building (N). The cellar is below, and the [[larder]] and store-room above. Between this building and the church, opening by one door into the cloisters, and by another to the outer part of the monastery area, is the &quot;parlour&quot; for interviews with visitors from the external world (O). On the eastern side of the north transept is the &quot;[[scriptorium]]&quot; or writing-room (P1), with the library above.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

To the east of the church stands a group of buildings comprising two miniature conventual establishments, each complete in itself. Each has a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings, i.e. refectory, dormitory, etc., and a church or chapel on one side, placed back to back. A detached building belonging to each contains a bath and a kitchen. One of these diminutive convents is appropriated to the &quot;[[oblati]]&quot; or novices (Q), the other to the sick monks as an &quot;[[Hospital|infirmary]]&quot; (R).
[[Image:ShrewsburyAbbeyCB.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Shrewsbury Abbey]]]]
The &quot;residence of the physicians&quot; (S) stands contiguous to the infirmary, and the physic garden (T) at the north-east corner of the monastery. Besides other rooms, it contains a drug store, and a chamber for those who are dangerously ill. The &quot;house for bloodletting and purging&quot; adjoins it on the west (U).{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The &quot;outer school,&quot; to the north of the convent area, contains a large schoolroom divided across the middle by a screen or partition, and surrounded by fourteen little rooms, termed the dwellings of the scholars. The head-master's house (W) is opposite, built against the side wall of the church. The two &quot;[[hospitia]]&quot; or guest-houses for the entertainment of strangers of different degrees (X1 X2) comprise a large common chamber or refectory in the centre, surrounded by sleeping-apartments. Each is provided with its own brewhouse and bakehouse, and that for travelers of a superior order has a kitchen and storeroom, with bedrooms for their servants and stables for their horses. There is also an &quot;hospitium&quot; for strange monks, abutting on the north wall of the church (Y).{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

Beyond the cloister, at the extreme verge of the convent area to the south, stands the &quot;factory&quot; (Z), containing workshops for [[shoemaker]]s, saddlers (or shoemakers, sellarii), cutlers and grinders, [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]]-makers, [[Tanner (occupation)|tanners]], curriers, fullers, [[Smith (metalwork)|smiths]] and [[goldsmith]]s, with their dwellings in the rear. On this side we also find the farm buildings, the large granary and threshing-floor (a), mills (c), malthouse (d). Facing the west are the stables (e), ox-sheds (f), goatstables (gl, piggeries (h), sheep-folds
(i), together with the servants' and labourers' quarters (k). At the south-east corner we find the hen and duck house, and poultry-yard (m), and the dwelling of the keeper (n). Hard by is the kitchen garden (o), the beds bearing the names of the vegetables growing in them, onions, garlic, celery, lettuces, poppy, carrots, cabbages, etc., eighteen in all. In the same way the physic garden presents the names of the medicinal herbs, and the cemetery (p) those of the trees, apple, pear, plum, quince, etc., planted there.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

===Cells===
Every large monastery had depending upon it smaller foundations known as cells or priories. Sometimes these foundations were no more than a single building serving as residence and farm offices, while other examples were miniature monasteries for 5 or 10 monks. The outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as villae or granges. They were usually staffed by [[lay-brothers]], sometimes under the supervision of a single monk.

===Westminster Abbey===
[[Westminster Abbey]] is another example of a great Benedictine abbey, identical in its general arrangements, so far as they can be traced, with those described above. The cloister and monastic buildings lie to the south side of the church. Parallel to the nave, on the south side of the cloister, was the refectory, with its lavatory at the door.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

On the eastern side there are remains of the dormitory, raised on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south transept. The chapter-house opens out of the same alley of the cloister. The small cloister lay to the south-east of the larger cloister, and still farther to the east we have the remains of the infirmary with the table hall, the refectory of those who were able to leave their chambers. The abbot's house formed a small courtyard at the west entrance, close to the inner gateway.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

Considerable portions of this remain, including the abbot's parlour, celebrated as &quot;the Jerusalem Chamber,&quot; his hall, now used for the Westminster King's Scholars, and the kitchen and butteries beyond.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

===York===
[[St Mary's Abbey, York]], of which the ground-plan is annexed, exhibits the usual Benedictine arrangements. The precincts are surrounded by a strong fortified wall on three sides, the river [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]] being sufficient protection on the fourth side. The entrance was by a strong gateway to the north. Close to the entrance was a chapel, where is now the church of St Olaf, in which the new-comers paid their devotions immediately on their arrival. Near the gate to the south was the guest-hall or hospitium. The buildings are completely ruined, but enough remains to enable us to identify the grand cruciform church, the cloister-court with the chapterhouse, the refecrefectory, the kitchen-court with its offices and the other principal apartments. The infirmary has perished completely.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==Cluny==
The history of monasticism is one of alternate periods of decay and revival. With growth in popular esteem came increase in material wealth, leading to luxury and worldliness. The first religious ardour cooled, the strictness of the rule was relaxed, until by the 10th century the decay of discipline was so complete in France that the monks are said to have been frequently unacquainted with the rule of St Benedict, and even ignorant that they were bound by any rule at all.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The reformation of abuses generally took the form of the establishment of new monastic orders, with new and more stringent rules, requiring a modification of the architectural arrangements. One of the earliest of these reformed orders was the [[Cluniac]]. This order took its name from,the little village of Cluny, {{convert|12|mi|km}} N.W. of Macon, near which, about AD 909, a reformed Benedictine abbey was founded by William, duke of [[Aquitaine]] and count of [[Rulers of Auvergne|Auvergne]], under Berno, abbot of Beaume. He was succeeded by Odo, who is often regarded as the founder of the order. The fame of Cluny spread far and wide. Its rigid rule was adopted by a vast number of the old Benedictine abbeys, who placed themselves in affiliation to the mother society, while new foundations sprang up in large numbers, all owing allegiance to the &quot;archabbot,&quot; established at Cluny.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

By the end of the 12th century the number of monasteries affiliated to Cluny in the various countries of western Europe amounted to 2000. The monastic establishment of Cluny was one of the most extensive and magnificent in France. We may form some idea of its enormous dimensions from the fact recorded, that when, in AD 1245, [[Pope Innocent IV]], accompanied by twelve cardinals, a patriarch, three archbishops, the two generals of the [[Carthusians]] and [[Cistercians]], the king ([[Louis IX of France|St Louis]]), and three of his sons, the queen mother, Baldwin, count of [[Flanders]] and emperor of [[Constantinople]], the duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and six lords, visited the abbey, the whole party, with their attendants, were lodged within the monastery without disarranging the monks, 400 in number. Nearly the whole of the abbey buildings, including the magnificent church, were swept away at the close of the 18th century. When the annexed ground-plan was taken, shortly before its destruction, nearly all the monastery, with the exception of the church, had been rebuilt.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The church, the ground-plan of which bears a remarkable resemblance to that of Lincoln Cathedral, was of vast dimensions. It was {{convert|656|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high. The nave had double vaulted aisles on either side. Like Lincoln, it had an eastern as well as a western transept, each furnished with apsidal chapels to the east. The western transept was {{convert|213|ft|m|abbr=on}}. long, and the eastern {{convert|123|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The choir terminated in a semicircular apse, surrounded by five chapels, also semicircular. The western entrance was approached by an ante-church, or narthex, itself an aisled church of no mean dimensions, flanked by two towers, rising from a stately flight of steps bearing a large stone cross. To the south of the church lay the cloister-court, of immense size, placed much farther to the west than is usually the case. On the south side of the cloister stood the refectory, an immense building, 100&amp;nbsp;ft (30 m) long and 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18 m) wide, accommodating six longitudinal and three transverse rows of tables. It was adorned with the portraits of the chief benefactors of the abbey, and with Scriptural subjects. The end wall displayed the Last Judgment. We are unable to identify any other of the principal buildings. The abbot's residence, still partly standing, adjoined the entrance-gate. The guest-house was close by. The bakehouse, also remaining, is a detached building of immense size.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

===English Cluniac houses===
The first English house of the Cluniac order was that of [[Lewes]], founded by the earl of Warren, c. AD 1077. Of this only a few fragments of the domestic buildings exist. The best preserved Cluniac houses in England are Castle Acre, Norfolk, and Wenlock, Shropshire. Ground-plans of both are given in Britton's Architectural Antiquities. They show several departures from the Benedictine arrangement. In each the prior's house is remarkably perfect. All Cluniac houses in England were French colonies, governed by priors of that nation. They did not secure their independence nor become &quot;abbeys&quot; till the reign of Henry VI. The Cluniac revival, with all its brilliancy, was but short-lived. The celebrity of this, as of other orders, worked its moral ruin. With their growth in wealth and dignity the Cluniac foundations became as worldly in life and as relaxed in discipline as their predecessors, and a fresh reform was needed.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==Cistercian abbeys==
[[Image:Abbey-of-senanque-provence-gordes.jpg|thumb||200px|right|Cistercian Abbey of [[Sénanque Abbey|Sénanque]]]]

The next great monastic revival, that of the [[Cistercian]]s, arose in the last years of the 11th century and had a wider diffusion as well as a longer and more honourable existence. Owing its real origin as a distinct foundation of reformed [[Benedictines]] to [[Stephen Harding]] in the year 1098, it derives its name from Cîteaux (Cistercium), a desolate and almost inaccessible forest solitude on the border between [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. The rapid growth and wide celebrity of the order are undoubtedly to be attributed to the enthusiastic piety of [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St Bernard]], abbot of the first of the monastic colonies, subsequently sent forth in such quick succession by the first Cistercian houses, the renowned abbey of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] (de Clara Valle), AD 1116.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The rigid self-abnegation, which was the ruling principle of this reformed congregation of the Benedictine order, extended itself to the churches and other buildings erected by them. The defining architectural characteristic of the Cistercian abbeys was the most extreme simplicity and a studied plainness. Only a single, central tower was permitted, and that was to be very low. Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were prohibited. The [[triforium]] was omitted. The windows were to be plain and undivided, and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass. All needless ornament was proscribed. The crosses must be of wood; the candlesticks of iron. The renunciation of the world was to be evidenced in all that met the eye.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The same spirit manifested itself in the choice of the sites of their monasteries. The more dismal, the more savage, the more hopeless a spot appeared, the more did it please their rigid mood. But they came not merely as ascetics, but as improvers. The Cistercian monasteries are, as a rule, found placed in deep, well-watered valleys. They always stand on the border of a stream; often with the buildings extending over it, as at [[Fountains Abbey]]. These valleys, now so rich and productive, had a very different appearance when the brethren first chose them as their place of retreat. Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets, and wild, impassable forests were their prevailing features.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} The &quot;bright valley,&quot; Clara Vallis of St Bernard, was known as the &quot;Valley of Wormwood,&quot; infamous as a den of robbers. &quot;It was a savage dreary solitude, so utterly barren that at first Bernard and his companions were reduced to live on beech leaves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Venables|1911}} cites Milman's Lat. Christ. vol. iii. p.&amp;nbsp;335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austin Canons==&lt;!--Engelbert_M%C3%BChlbacher links here--&gt;
The buildings of the Austin [[canon (priest)|canons]] or Black canons (so called from the colour of their habit) present few distinctive peculiarities. This order had its first seat in England at [[Colchester, England|Colchester]], where a house for Austin canons was founded about AD 1105, and it very soon spread widely. As an order of [[regular clergy]], holding a middle position between monks and secular canons, almost resembling a community of parish priests living under rule, they adopted naves of great length to accommodate large congregations. The choir is usually long, and is sometimes, as at Llanthony and Christchurch (Twynham), shut off from the aisles, or, as at Bolton, Kirkham, etc., is destitute of aisles altogether. The nave in the northern houses, not unfrequently, had only a north aisle, as at Bolton, Brinkburn and [[Lanercost Priory|Lanercost]]. The arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary type. The prior's lodge was almost invariably attached to the S.W. angle of the nave.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The above plan of the [[Abbey of St Augustine]]'s at [[Bristol]], now the [[Bristol Cathedral|cathedral church of that city]], shows the arrangement of the buildings, which departs very little from the ordinary Benedictine type. The Austin canons' house at Thornton, in Lincolnshire, is remarkable for the size and magnificence of its gate-house, the upper floors of which formed the guest-house of the establishment, and for possessing an octagonal chapter-house of Decorated date.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==Premonstratensians==
{{Main|Premonstratensians}}
The Premonstratensian regular canons, or White canons, had as many as 35 houses in England, of which the most perfect remaining are those of [[Easby Abbey|Easby, Yorkshire]], and [[Bayham Old Abbey|Bayham, Kent]]. The head house of the order in England was [[Welbeck Abbey|Welbeck]]. This order was a reformed branch of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian canons]], founded, AD 1119, by [[Norbert of Xanten]], on the [[Lower Rhine]], c. 1080) at Prémontré, a secluded marshy valley in the forest of [[Coucy]] in the [[diocese of Laon]]. The order spread widely. Even in the founder's lifetime it possessed houses in [[Aleppo]] and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] where &quot;The Premonstrntensian abbey of Saint Samuel was a daughter house of Prémontré itself. Its abbot had the status of a [[suffragan]] of the [[patriarch of Jerusalem]], with the right to
a cross but not to a mitre nor a ring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Denys, ''The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: L-Z (exluding Tyre)'', Cambridge University Press, New York, 1998, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; It long maintained its rigid austerity, until in the course of years wealth impaired its discipline, and its members sank into indolence and luxury. The Premonstratensians were brought to England shortly after AD 1140, and were first settled at Newhouse, in Lincolnshire, near the [[Humber]]. The ground-plan of Easby Abbey, owing to its situation on the edge of the steeply sloping banks of a river, is singularly irregular. The cloister is duly placed on the south side of the church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions round it. But the cloister garth, as at Chichester, is not rectangular, and all the surrounding buildings are thus made to sprawl in a very awkward fashion. The church follows the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern abbeys, and has only one aisle to the nave—that to the north; while the choir is long, narrow and aisleless. Each transept has an aisle to the east, forming three chapels.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The church at Bayham was destitute of aisles either to nave or choir. The latter terminated in a three-sided apse. This church is remarkable for its exceeding narrowness in proportion to its length. Extending in longitudinal dimensions {{convert|257|ft|m|abbr=on}}., it is not more than {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}. broad. Stern Premonstratensian canons wanted no congregations, and cared for no possessions; therefore they built their church like a long room.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The Premonstratension order still exists and a small group of these ''Chanones de Premontre'' now run the former Benedictine Abbey at [[Conques]] in southwest France, which has become well known as a refuge for pilgrims travelling the [[Way of Saint James]], from [[Le Puy en Velay]] in Auvergne, to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Galicia, Spain.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Annales School''' ({{IPA-fr|anal}}) is a style of [[historiography]] developed by [[France|French]] [[historians]] in the 20th century. It is named after its French-language scholarly journal ''[http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/ Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in [[France]] and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasis on social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of [[Marxist historiography]].

The school deals primarily with the premodern world (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and [[Latin America]]. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915– ), Robert Mandrou (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924– ) and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988).  Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel,&lt;ref&gt;Since 1978, Revel has taught at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales ([[Paris]]), where he is ''directeur d’études'' (full professor); he served as president of the Ecole from 1995 to 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''. 

The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal founded in 1929, ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' (&quot;Annals of economic and social history&quot;), which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. They rejected events as less important than the mental framework that shaped decisions. 

Braudel was editor of ''Annales'' from 1956 to 1968, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff.  However, Braudel's informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie, who was unable to maintain a consistent focus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the 1960s the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence spread out from Paris, but did not come in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.&lt;ref&gt;One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire &amp; mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Paris ignored the powerful developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research in those countries, while France fell behind.&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge,&quot; 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 [[postmodern]]ist sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives.  As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures  as explanatory forces contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is &quot;no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, &quot;Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social,&quot; in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.&lt;ref&gt;On the decline of Annales, see Hunt (1986); for an obituary see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journal==
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d’histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).&lt;ref name=&quot;journal names&quot;&gt;P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to [[geography]]&lt;ref&gt;See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the intellectual world view of common people, or &quot;mentality&quot; (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in [[Paris]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Année Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians which Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, &quot;Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography,&quot; ''Past &amp; Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.&lt;ref&gt;J.H.Hexter, &quot;Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien&quot;, on Historians, pp. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Cofounder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch was highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, &quot;Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch&quot; at 
[http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society''  were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
An eminent member of this school, [[Georges Duby]], wrote in the foreword of his book ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' that the history he taught &lt;blockquote&gt;relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Post war==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the German occupation of France in [[World War II]] for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored [[Fernand Braudel]], who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a &quot;second&quot; era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the [[Mediterranean]] region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.   

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by touch.  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations (&quot;longue durée&quot;) studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading Freud and Proust. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 80s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
[[Fernand Braudel]] became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution—one of the central institutions of the School.  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Harris, &quot;Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity.&quot; ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. Issn: 1363-3554 Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''Philippe II et la Franche-Comté.'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies set in Paris. 

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Hinrichs, &quot;Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Französischen Geschichtswissenschaft – Ein Essay,&quot; ''Blätter Für Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1–12. Issn: 0006-4408 Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in Italy and Poland. Franciszek Bujak (1875–1953) and Jan Rutkowski (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the &quot;[[Polish October]]&quot; of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s Federico Brito Figueroa was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the &quot;Annales School&quot; starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Nil Santiáñez-Tió, &quot;Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna.&quot; [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. Issn: 0018-2176 Fulltext: [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0018-2176%28199722%2965%3A3%3C267%3ATYDHPD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23  in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians in the history department decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''The Practice of History'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]''. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of &quot;new social history&quot; from entirely different routes.&lt;ref&gt;Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer Louis Henry. Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, Professeur in the Collège de France, and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.  

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of &quot;practices,&quot; his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of &quot;materials,&quot; his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of &quot;places,&quot; his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Kraus, &quot;Appropriation et pratiques de la lecture.

{{Antimatter}}

In [[particle physics]], '''antimatter''' is the extension of the concept of the [[antiparticle]] to [[matter]], where antimatter is composed of antiparticles in the same way that normal matter is composed of particles. For example, a [[positron]] (the antiparticle of the electron or {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}) and an [[antiproton]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}}) can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom in the same way that an electron and a proton form a ''normal matter'' hydrogen atom. Furthermore, mixing matter and antimatter can lead to the [[annihilation]] of both in the same way that mixing antiparticles and particles does, thus giving rise to high-energy [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s) or other particle–antiparticle pairs.

There is considerable speculation as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter, whether there exist other places that are almost entirely antimatter instead, and what might be possible if antimatter could be harnessed. At this time, the apparent [[baryon asymmetry|asymmetry of matter and antimatter]] in the [[visible universe]] is one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]]. The process by which this asymmetry between particles and antiparticles developed is called [[baryogenesis]].

==History of the concept==
The idea of [[negative matter]] has appeared in past theories of matter, theories which have now been abandoned.  Using the once popular [[vortex theory of gravity]] the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by [[William Mitchinson Hicks|William Hicks]] in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, [[Karl Pearson]] proposed the existence of &quot;squirts&quot; (sources) and sinks of the flow of [[Luminiferous aether|aether]].  The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter, a term which Pearson is credited with coining.  Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.&lt;ref&gt;

The term antimatter was first used by [[Arthur Schuster]] in two rather whimsical letters to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;

|bibcode = 1898Natur..58..367S }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he coined the term. He hypothesized [[antiatom]]s, whole antimatter solar systems and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other.  Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed [[antigravity|negative gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

The modern theory of antimatter begins  in 1928, with a paper&lt;ref&gt;

Dirac realised that his [[Dirac equation|relativistic version]] of the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]] for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons. These were discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl D. Anderson]] in 1932 and named [[positron]]s (a contraction of &quot;positive electrons&quot;). Although Dirac did not himself use the term antimatter, its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons, antiprotons etc.&lt;ref&gt;

==Notation==
One way to denote an antiparticle is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{SubatomicParticle|proton}} and {{SubatomicParticle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=no|Up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Origin and asymmetry==
Almost all matter observable from the Earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter. If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[solar system]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[galactic core|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (i.e. the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by [[speed of light|''c'']]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Recent observations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant cloud of antimatter surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of [[X-ray binaries]] (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains tremendous energy while falling into a [[stellar remnant]].&lt;ref&gt;

Antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far away galaxies due to [[cosmic inflation]] in the primordial time of the universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, will have the same chemistry and [[spectrometry]] as normal matter galaxies and their [[astronomical object]]s would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=F.

==Natural production==

Recent (as of January 2011) research by the American Astronomical Society has discovered antimatter originating above thunderstorm clouds.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first time antimatter has been observed occurring naturally on Earth.

==Artificial production==
Antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the [[pair production]] threshold). During the period of [[baryogenesis]], when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[baryon asymmetry]], is attributed to [[CP-violation|violation]] of the [[CP-symmetry]] relating matter and antimatter. The exact mechanism of this violation during baryogenesis remains a mystery.

Positrons can also be produced by radioactive [[Beta decay|{{SubatomicParticle|beta+}} decay]], but this mechanism can occur both naturally and artificially.

Positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory. Previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper-thin targets; however, new simulations showed that short, ultra-intense lasers and millimeter-thick gold are a far more effective source.&lt;ref&gt;

===Antiprotons, antineutrons, and antinuclei===
{{Main|Antiproton|Antineutron}}

The antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[physicist]]s [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]], for which they were awarded the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].
&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An antiproton consists of two up [[antiquark]] and one down antiquark ({{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down antiquark}}).  The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception that the antiproton has opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton. Shortly afterwards, in 1956, the antineutron was discovered in [[proton]]–proton collisions at the [[Bevatron]] ([[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]) by [[Bruce Cork]] and colleagues.

In addition to anti[[baryon]]s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by [[Antonino Zichichi]] reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at [[CERN]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Antihydrogen atoms===
{{Main|Antihydrogen}}
&lt;!-- Should antihelium be folded into this section? I haven't checked to see whether they'd created antihelium nuclei or true antihelium atoms with bound positrons. --&gt;
In 1995 [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine antihydrogen atoms by implementing the [[SLAC]]/[[Fermilab]] concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was performed using the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri. Fermilab soon confirmed the [[CERN]] findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210, and subsequent experiments (at both [[CERN]] and Fermilab) were extremely energetic (&quot;hot&quot;) and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s — [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]]. In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the  [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also situated at CERN. The primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic (&quot;cold&quot;) antihydrogen, better suited to study.

In 1999 [[CERN]] activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from {{val|3.5|ul=GeV}} to {{val|5.3|ul=MeV}} — still too &quot;hot&quot; to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first &quot;cold&quot; antihydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall cooling process is workable, but highly inefficient; approximately 25 million antiprotons leave the Antiproton Decelerator and roughly 25,000 make it to the Penning-Malmberg trap, which is about {{frac|1|1000}} or .1% of the original amount.

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped.  To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma.  The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions.  Eventually, the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than 100&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|meV]].&lt;ref&gt;

Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasmas, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen.  This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates.  Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

Most precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen can only be done if the antihydrogen were trapped; i.e. held in place for a long time.   While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, their spin produces [[magnetic moment]]s. These magnetic moments will interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms will be attracted to a magnetic minimum.  Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.&lt;ref&gt;

===Preservation===
&lt;!--===Antimatter trap===!--&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter that is composed of [[charged particle]]s can be contained by a combination of an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] in a device known as a [[Penning trap]]. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which [[atomic trap]]s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the [[dipole]] moment ([[Electric dipole moment|electrical]] or [[Magnetic moment|magnetic]]) of the trapped particles. At high [[vacuum]], the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a [[magneto-optical trap]] or [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]]. Small particles can also be suspended with [[optical tweezers]] using a highly focused laser beam.

===Cost===
Scientists claim antimatter is the costliest material to make.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA1999&quot;/&gt; In 2006, Gerald Smith estimated $250 million could produce 10 milligrams of [[positron]]s&lt;ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Medical===
Antimatter-matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). In positive [[beta decay]], a [[nuclide]] loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and [[neutrino]]s are also given off). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/pbar_med.pdf|title=Antiproton portable traps and medical applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Deuterium]] --&gt;
In antimatter-matter collisions resulting in [[photon]] emission, the entire [[rest mass]] of the particles is converted to [[kinetic energy]]. The [[energy density|energy per unit mass]] ({{val|9|e=16|u=J/kg}}) is about 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than [[chemical energy]] (compared to [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] at {{val|4.2|e=6|u=J/kg}}, and [[heat of formation|formation]] of [[water]] at {{val|1.56|e=7|u=J/kg}}), about 4 orders of magnitude greater than [[nuclear energy]] that can be liberated today using [[nuclear fission]] (about {{val|200|u=MeV}} per atomic nucleus that undergoes nuclear fission,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{val|8|e=13|u=J/kg}}), and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the best possible from [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] (about {{val|6.3|e=14|u=J/kg}} for the [[proton-proton chain reaction|proton-proton chain]]). The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E'' = ''mc''²), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT. For comparison, [[Tsar Bomb]], the largest [[nuclear weapon]] ever detonated, reacted an estimated yield of 50 megatons.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology, because while electron/positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, in reactions between protons and antiprotons their energy is converted into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s, and while the neutral pions decay into high-energy photons, the charged pions decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about 0.22 + (2/3)*0.78 = 0.74). Gamma radiation can be largely absorbed, although some is lost. Neutrinos very rarely interact with any form of matter, so for all intents and purposes, the energy converted into neutrinos can be considered to be lost.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Antimatter rocket]]ry ideas, such as the [[redshift rocket]], propose the use of antimatter as [[fuel]] for [[interplanetary travel]] or possibly [[interstellar travel]]. Since the energy density of antimatter is vastly higher than conventional fuels, the thrust to weight equation for such craft would be very different from conventional spacecraft.

The scarcity of antimatter means that it is not readily available to be used as fuel, although it could be used in [[antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion]] for space applications. Generating a single antiproton is immensely difficult and requires particle accelerators and vast amounts of energy — millions of times more than is released after it is annihilated with ordinary matter due to inefficiencies in the process. Known methods of producing antimatter from energy also produce an equal amount of normal matter, so the theoretical limit is that half of the input energy is converted to antimatter. Counterbalancing this, when antimatter annihilates with ordinary matter, energy equal to twice the mass of the antimatter is liberated — so energy storage in the form of antimatter could (in theory) be 100% efficient.

For more regular (earthly) applications however (e.g. regular transport, use in portable generators, powering of cities, ...), artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier, despite its high energy density, because the process of creating antimatter involves a large amount of wasted energy and is extremely inefficient. According to CERN, only one part in ten billion ({{val|e=-10}}) of the energy invested in the production of antimatter particles can be subsequently retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;

Antimatter production is currently very limited, but has been growing at a nearly [[geometric progression|geometric rate]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} since the observation of the first antiproton in 1955 by Segrè and Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;

Some researchers claim that with current technology, it is possible to obtain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs). Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied in with electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online without the advent of such technologies as [[deuterium]]-tritium [[fusion power]] (assuming that such a power source actually would prove to be cheap).

Many experts{{Who|date=March 2011}}, however, dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude. They point out that in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means to produce 1&amp;nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Storage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel against each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume. [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are neutral so in principle they do not suffer the plasma problems of antiprotons described above. But cold antihydrogen is far more difficult to produce than antiprotons.

One researcher of the [[CERN]] laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:
{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at [[CERN]] and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:CasaBatllo.jpg|thumb||Casa Batlló]]
[[Image:casa batllo roof.jpg|thumb|200px|Roof architecture at Casa Batlló]]

'''Casa Batlló''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈkazə βəʎˈʎo}}) is a building restored by [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Josep Maria Jujol]], built in the year 1877 and remodelled in the years 1904&amp;ndash;1906; located at 43, [[Passeig de Gràcia, Barcelona|Passeig de Gràcia]] (''passeig'' is [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for promenade or [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]]), part of the [[Illa de la Discòrdia]] (the &quot;Block of Discord&quot;) in the ''[[Eixample]]'' district of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].  Gaudí's assistants [[Domènec Sugrañes i Gras]] , [[Josep Canaleta]] y [[Joan Rubió]] also contributed to the renovation project.

The local name for the building is ''Casa dels ossos'' (House of Bones), and indeed it does have a [[viscera]]l, [[skeleton|skeletal]] organic quality. It was originally designed for a [[middle-class]] family and situated in a prosperous district of Barcelona.

The building looks very remarkable &amp;mdash; like everything Gaudí designed, only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. 

It seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the [[façade]] is decorated with a [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencadís]]) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaudi's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.

[[Image:Parcguell.jpg|right|frame|The entrance to the park]]
'''Park Güell''' ({{lang-ca|Parc Güell}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈparg ˈɡweʎ|IPA}}) is a garden complex with [[Architecture|architectural]] elements situated on the hill of [[el Carmel]] in the [[Gràcia]] district of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It was designed by the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[architect]] [[Antoni Gaudí]] and built in the years 1900 to 1914. It is part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] &quot;Works of [[Antoni Gaudí]]&quot;.

==Origins as a Housing Development==
[[File:Barcelona 193.JPG|thumb|The Gaudí Museum]]
The park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count [[Eusebi Güell]], whom the park was named after. It was inspired by the English [[garden city movement]]; hence the original English name ''Park'' (in the Catalan language spoken in Catalonia where Barcelona is located, the word for &quot;Park&quot; is &quot;Parc&quot;, and the name of the place is &quot;Parc Güell&quot; in its original language). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called ''Muntanya Pelada'' (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House, and was next to a neighborhood of upper class houses called ''La Salut'' (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi Güell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaudí. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaudí, at Güell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906.&lt;ref name=zim&gt;{{Citation | last = Zimmermann | first = Robert | year =2002 | title =The Best of Gaudí | place = | publisher = | url =http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This house, where Gaudi lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains  original works by Gaudi and several of his collaborators. It is now the Gaudí Museum (Casa Museu Gaudí) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.

==Municipal Garden==
[[Image:Park Guell Dragon Fountain.JPG|right|thumb|Gaudí's multicolored mosaic dragon fountain at the main entrance, prior to vandalism early in 2007]]
It has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. While entrance to the Park is free, Gaudí's house, &quot;la Torre Rosa,&quot; &amp;mdash; containing furniture that he designed &amp;mdash; can be only visited for an entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Park Güell and the [[Sagrada Família]] Church.

[[Image:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|Gaudí's mosaic work on the main terrace]]

Park Güell is skillfully designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park.  The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaudí.

{{wide image|Pgfront.jpg|300px
| 360 degree view at the main entrance of the park outside the hall of columns.|45%|right|alt=360 degree view outside hall of columns}}
The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a [[sea serpent]]. To design the curvature of the bench surface Gaudí used the shape of buttocks left by a naked workman sitting in wet clay.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaudí incorporated many motifs of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. The visitor was originally greeted by two life-size mechanical [[gazelle]]s (a major euphemistic symbol of 'the young beloved' in the Hebrew strand of the [[medieval]] love [[Spanish poetry|poetry of the region]]), but these have since been lost during the turbulence of [[Spanish Civil War|war]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaudí as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaudí designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[Church of Colònia Güell]] so that the [[Catenary#The inverted catenary arch|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form perfect compression structures.&lt;ref name=works&gt;[http://me-wserver.mecheng.strath.ac.uk/group2003/groupl/Inspirational%20people/Antoni%20Gaudi_files/Antoni%20Gaudi.htm The Works of Gaudí], retrieved 2007-04-03&lt;/ref&gt;

The large cross at the Park's high-point offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Familia and the [[Montjuïc]] area visible at a distance.

The observant visitor will notice green birds flying around amongst the [[rock pigeon|pigeon]]s and [[house sparrow|sparrow]]s. These are [[monk parakeet]]s that have became a common species with a growing population started from some individuals escaped from captivity sometime in the 70s. Like the pigeons they nest in the tall palm trees. Another bird to look out for is the hummingbird that can be seen on some days, if you look hard enough.

'''Casa Milà''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈkazə miˈɫa}}), better known as '''''La Pedrera''''' ({{IPA-ca|ɫə pəˈðɾeɾə|pron}}, meaning the 'The Quarry'), is a building designed by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[architect]] [[Antoni Gaudí]] and built during the years 1905–1910, being considered officially completed in 1912. It is located at 92, ''[[Passeig de Gràcia]]'' (''passeig'' is Catalan for promenade) in the ''[[Eixample]]'' district of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

==History==
It was built for the married couple, Rosario Segimon and Pere Milà. Rosario Segimon was the wealthy widow of José Guardiola, an ''[[Indiano]]'', a term applied locally to the Catalans returning from the American colonies with tremendous wealth. Her second husband, Pere Milà, was a developer who was criticized for his flamboyant lifestyle and ridiculed by the contemporary residents of Barcelona, when they joked about his love of money and opulence, wondering if he was not rather more interested in &quot;the widow’s ''guardiola''&quot; ([[piggy bank]]), than in &quot;Guardiola’s widow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutadelmodernisme.com/default.aspx?idioma=en&amp;contenido=body_rutamodernisme_04en.htm rutadelmodernisme.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudi, a Catholic and a devotee of the [[Virgin Mary]], planned for the Casa Milà to be a spiritual symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Sennott, Stephen, [http://books.google.com/books?id=opvy1zGI2EcC&amp;pg Encyclopedia of twentieth century architecture], p. 224, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Overt religious elements include an excerpt from the [[Rosary]] prayer on the cornice and planned statues of Mary, specifically [[Our Lady of the Rosary]], and two [[archangels]], [[St. Michael]] and [[St. Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;Sennott, Stephen, [http://books.google.com/books?id=opvy1zGI2EcC&amp;pg Encyclopedia of twentieth century architecture], p. 224, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_vida/pedrera.html La Pedrera (Casa Milà, 1906-1910)] Gaudiclub.com&lt;/ref&gt;
The design by Gaudi was not followed in some aspects. The local government objected to some
aspects of the project, fined the owners for many infractions of [[building code]]s, ordered the demolition of aspects exceeding the height standard for the city.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudi: A Biography; Gijs van Hensbergen; Harper Collins; page 214-216&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century Architecture states that the statuary was indeed [[Mary the mother of Jesus]], also noting Gaudi's devoutness, and notes that the owner decided not to include it after [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Semana Trágica]], an outbreak of [[anticlericalism]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Sennott, Stephen, [http://books.google.com/books?id=opvy1zGI2EcC&amp;pg Encyclopedia of twentieth century architecture], p. 224, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; After the decision was made to exclude the statuary of Mary and the archangels, Gaudi contemplated abandoning the project but was persuaded not to by a priest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_vida/pedrera.html La Pedrera (Casa Milà, 1906-1910)] Gaudiclub.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Casa Milà'' was in poor condition in the early 1980s. It had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate, but it has since been restored and many of the original colors revived.

==Noteworthy==
*The building is part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] &quot;Works of [[Antoni Gaudí]]&quot;. The building is now owned by [[Caixa Catalunya]].
*Gaudi wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other therefore there were only lifts on every second floor so people had to communicate with one another on different floors.

== Architecture ==
''Casa Milà'' was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] appearance:
* the 1921 [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]], designed by [[Erich Mendelsohn]]
* [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]
* [[Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut]], [[Ronchamp]], [[France]], designed by [[Le Corbusier]]
* the [[Hundertwasserhaus]] and other works by Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]
* [[Disney Concert Hall]] in [[Los Angeles]], by [[Frank Gehry]]

Free exhibitions often are held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the second floor and the roof. The other floors (3-5) are not open to visitors.

== ''Casa Milà'' in the media and literature ==
[[File:Catalunya en Miniatura-La Pedrera.JPG|thumb|Scale model at the [[Catalunya en Miniatura]] park]]
* A scene in ''[[Professione: reporter]]'', a film directed by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], was filmed on the roof of the building.
* Mentioned in the book by Eoin Colfer: [[Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony]]
* Mentioned in the book by Trudi Alexy 'The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot'
* Several scenes in the movie, ''[[Gaudi Afternoon]]'', were filmed at ''Casa Milà''.
* A scale model of Casa Milà (La Pedrera) is exhibited at the [[Catalunya en Miniatura]] park.

[[Image:Particles and antiparticles.svg|thumb|Illustration of electric charge as well as general size of [[particle]]s (left) and antiparticles (right). From top to bottom; [[electron]]/[[positron]], [[proton]]/[[antiproton]], [[neutron]]/[[antineutron]].]]

Corresponding to most kinds of [[particle physics|particles]], there is an associated '''antiparticle''' with the same [[mass]] and opposite [[electric charge]]. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positively charged [[antielectron]], or [[positron]], which is produced naturally in certain types of [[radioactive decay]]. 

The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an [[antiproton]] and a [[positron]] can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom, which has almost exactly the same properties as a hydrogen atom. A physicist whose body was made of antimatter, doing experiments in a laboratory also made of antimatter, using chemicals and substances made of antiparticles, would find almost exactly the same results in all experiments. This leads to the question of why the [[baryogenesis|formation of matter after the Big Bang]] resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and [[antimatter]]. The discovery of [[CP violation]] helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.

Particle-antiparticle pairs can [[Annihilation|annihilate]] each other, producing photons; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, charge is conserved. For example, the antielectrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of [[gamma rays]]. 

Antiparticles are produced naturally in [[beta decay]], and in the interaction of [[cosmic ray]]s in the Earth's atmosphere. Because charge is conserved, it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge (as in beta decay), or creating a particle of the opposite charge. The latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously, as in [[particle accelerator]]s. This is the inverse of the particle-antiparticle annihilation process.

Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of [[quarks]], the [[antineutron]] from [[Quark#Antiquarks|antiquarks]], and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as [[photon]]s, the hypothetical [[graviton]]s, and some [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]]s. These are called [[Majorana particle]]s and can annihilate with themselves.

== History ==
=== Experiment ===

In 1932, soon after the prediction of [[positron]]s by [[Paul Dirac]], [[Carl D. Anderson]] found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a [[cloud chamber]]&amp;mdash; a [[particle detector]] in which moving [[electron]]s (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a [[magnetic field]]. Originally, positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction.  Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and therefore opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.

The [[antiproton]] and [[antineutron]] were found by [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]] in 1955 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of [[antimatter]] have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/11/101118-antimatter-trapped-engines-bombs-nature-science-cern/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hole theory ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the development of [[quantum field theory]] made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary, even though it lingers on in many textbooks.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp; [[Steven Weinberg]] in ''The quantum theory of fields, Volume 1: Foundations'', p. 14, ISBN 0-521-55001-7
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Solutions of the [[Dirac equation]] contained negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amount of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a &quot;sea&quot; of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower energy states so that, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this [[Dirac sea]] to become a positive energy particle. But when lifted out, it would leave behind a ''[[electron hole|hole]]'' in the sea which would act exactly like a positive energy electron with a reversed charge. These he interpreted as the &quot;negative energy electron&quot; and attempted to identify them with [[proton]]s in his 1930 paper ''A Theory of Electrons and Protons''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Dirac |first1=Paul
 |year=1930
 |title=A Theory of Electrons and Protons
 |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]
 |volume=126 |issue= |pages=360–365
 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1930.0013
|bibcode = 1930RSPSA.126..360D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these &quot;negative-energy electrons&quot; turned out to be [[positron]]s, and not [[proton]]s.

Dirac was aware of the problem that his picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe. Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until [[Hermann Weyl]] proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Photon}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Photon}}, where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons. [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Igor Tamm]] proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.

However, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains. Also, as we now know, [[bosons]] also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only [[fermions]] do), hole theory doesn't work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in [[quantum field theory]], which solves both these problems.

== Particle-antiparticle annihilation ==
{{main|Annihilation}}
[[Image:kkbar had.svg|frame|An example of a virtual [[pion]] pair which influences the propagation of a [[kaon]] causing a neutral kaon to ''mix'' with the antikaon. This is an example of [[renormalization]] in [[quantum field theory]]&amp;mdash; the field theory being necessary because the number of particles changes from one to two and back again.]]

If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;→ &amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Photon}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Photon}} (the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair) is an example.
The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair, {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Photon}}, cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process. However, in the Coulomb field of a nucleus the [[translational invariance]] is broken and single-photon annihilation may occur. &lt;sup&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v124/i6/p1851_1]&lt;/sup&gt; The reverse reaction (in free space, without an atomic nucleus) is also impossible for this reason. In quantum field theory this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may ''fluctuate'' into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the [[vacuum state]] and [[renormalization]] of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for [[neutral particle mixing]] through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of [[mass renormalization]].

== Properties of antiparticles ==

[[Quantum state]]s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the [[C-symmetry|charge conjugation]] ('''C'''), [[P-symmetry|parity]] ('''P'''), and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] ('''T''') operators. If &lt;math&gt;|p,\sigma ,n \rangle &lt;/math&gt; denotes the quantum state of a particle ('''n''') with momentum '''p''', spin '''J''' whose component in the z-direction is σ, then one has
::&lt;math&gt;CPT \ |p,\sigma,n \rangle\ =\ (-1)^{J-\sigma}\ |p,-\sigma,n^c \rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;''' denotes the charge conjugate state, ''i.e.'', the antiparticle. This behaviour under '''CPT''' is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincare group]]. Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If '''T''' is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then
::&lt;math&gt;T\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |-p,-\sigma,n\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;CP\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |-p,\sigma,n^c\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |p,\sigma,n^c\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have
*the same mass '''m'''
*the same spin state '''J'''
*opposite [[electric charge]]s '''q''' and '''-q'''.

== Quantum field theory ==

''This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of [[canonical quantization]] of a [[quantum field theory]].''

One may try to quantize an electron [[field (physics)|field]] without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing

::&lt;math&gt;\psi (x)=\sum_{k}u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where we use the symbol ''k'' to denote the quantum numbers ''p'' and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, ''E(k)'', and ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with [[fermion]]s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]

::&lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{k} E(k) a^\dagger_k a_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then one sees immediately that the expectation value of ''H'' need not be positive. This is because ''E(k)'' can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.

So one has to introduce the charge conjugate ''antiparticle'' field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations

::&lt;math&gt;b_{k\prime} = a^\dagger_k\ \mathrm{and}\ b^\dagger_{k\prime}=a_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' has the same ''p'', and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form

::&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\sum_{k_+} u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t}+\sum_{k_-} u_k (x)b^\dagger _k e^{-iE(k)t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes

::&lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{k_+} E_k a^\dagger _k a_k + \sum_{k_-} |E(k)|b^\dagger_k b_k + E_0,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an infinite negative constant. The [[vacuum state]] is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;a_k |0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_k |0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, '''H''' is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a [[fermion]].

This approach is due to [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Wendell Furry]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. If one quantizes a real [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]], then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.

=== Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation ===&lt;!--&quot;Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation&quot; and &quot;Stückelberg–Feynman interpretation&quot; redirect here--&gt;

By considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass '''m''' and spin '''J''' but opposite charges '''q'''. This allowed him to rewrite [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] precisely in the form of diagrams. [[Richard Feynman]] later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism, and they are now called [[Feynman diagram]]s. Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time. This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today.

Since this picture was first developed by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], and acquired its modern form in Feynman's work, it is called the ''Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation'' of antiparticles to honor both scientists.

'''Arabian Prince''' is the [[stage name]] of '''Mik Lezan''' (born June 17, 1962), a [[rapping|rapper]] and [[hip hop production|hip hop producer]], best known for being an original member of the rap group, [[N.W.A]].

==Biography==
He started working with [[Bobby Jimmy &amp; the Critters]] in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for [[JJ Fad]], &quot;Supersonic.&quot;

He was a founding member of N.W.A. but when fellow member Ice Cube came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988 he found himself to be surplus to the band — [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]] and [[MC Ren]] were the main performers, [[DJ Yella]] was the [[turntablist]] and [[Dr. Dre]] was the main producer.

After leaving N.W.A., Arabian Prince began his solo career. His first solo album ''Brother Arab'' was released in 1989, although it sold poorly.

Arabian Prince continued his solo career and released his fourth album ''Where's My Bytches'' in 1993, which was his last album of the 1990s.

He recently started releasing music again with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone records. In 2007, he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label.  In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his [[Electro-hop|electro-rap]] material from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stonesthrow.com/arabianprince/ Arabian Prince | Stones Throw Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game ''[[College Hoops 2K8]]''.

In [[mathematics]], '''associativity''' is a property of some [[binary operation]]s. It means that, within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the [[operand]]s is not changed. That is, rearranging the [[Bracket#Parentheses_%28_%29|parentheses]] in such an expression will not change its value. Consider, for instance, the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;(5+2)+1=5+(2+1)=8 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;5\times(5\times3)=(5\times5)\times3=75 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the first equation.  Even though the parentheses were rearranged (the left side requires adding 5 and 2 first, then adding 1 to the result, whereas the right side requires adding 2 and 1 first, then 5), the value of the expression was not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition on any [[real number]]s, we say that &quot;addition of real numbers is an associative operation.&quot;

Associativity is not to be confused with [[commutativity]]. Commutativity justifies changing the order or sequence of the operands within an expression while associativity does not. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;(5+2)+1=5+(2+1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of associativity because the parentheses were changed (and consequently the order of operations during evaluation) while the operands 5, 2, and 1 appeared in exactly the same order from left to right in the expression. In contrast,

:&lt;math&gt;(5+2)+1=(2+5)+1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of commutativity, not associativity, because the operand sequence changed when the 2 and 5 switched places.

Associative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many [[algebraic structure]]s (such as [[semigroup (mathematics)|semigroups]] and [[category (mathematics)|categories]]) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.

However, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; one common example would be the [[vector cross product]].

== Definition ==
Formally, a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*\!\!\!&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called '''associative''' if it satisfies the '''associative law''':

: &lt;math&gt;(x * y) * z=x * (y * z)\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
: ''Using * to denote a [[binary operation]] performed on a set''

: &lt;math&gt;(xy)z=x(yz) = xyz \qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
:''An example of multiplicative associativity

The evaluation order does not affect the value of such expressions, and it can be shown that the same holds for expressions containing ''any'' number of &lt;math&gt;*\!\!\!&lt;/math&gt; operations. Thus, when &lt;math&gt;*\!\!\!&lt;/math&gt; is associative, the evaluation order can therefore be left unspecified without causing ambiguity, by omitting the parentheses and writing simply:

:&lt;math&gt;xyz,&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is important to remember that changing the order of operations does not involve or permit moving the operands around within the expression; the sequence of operands is always unchanged.

A very  different perspective is obtained by rephrasing associativity using functional notation: &lt;math&gt; f(f(x,y),z) = f(x,f(y,z))&lt;/math&gt;: when expressed in this form, associativity becomes less obvious.

Associativity can be generalized to [[arity|n-ary operations]]. Ternary associativity is (abc)de = a(bcd)e = ab(cde), i.e. the string abcde with any three adjacent elements bracketed. N-ary associativity is a string of length n+(n-1) with any n adjacent elements bracketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Dudek |first=W.A. |title=On some old problems in n-ary groups |url=http://www.quasigroups.eu/contents/contents8.php?m=trzeci |journal=Quasigroups and Related Systems |year=2001 |volume=8 |pages= 15–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

Some examples of associative operations include the following.

* The prototypical example of an associative operation is [[string concatenation]]: the concatenation of &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; can be computed by concatenating the first two strings (giving &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello, &quot;&lt;/code&gt;) and appending the third string (&lt;code&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), or by joining the second and third string (giving &lt;code&gt;&quot;, world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) and concatenating the first string (&lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) with the result. String concatenation is not commutative. 

* In [[arithmetic]], [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s are associative; i.e.,
:: &lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z\quad
\\
(x\,y)z=x(y\,z)=x\,y\,z\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}.
&lt;/math&gt;

* Addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s and [[quaternion]]s is associative. Addition of [[octonion]]s is also associative, but multiplication of octonions is non-associative.

* The [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]] functions act associatively.
:: &lt;math&gt;

\left.
\begin{matrix}
\operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{gcd}(x,y),z)=
\operatorname{gcd}(x,\operatorname{gcd}(y,z))=
\operatorname{gcd}(x,y,z)\ \quad
\\
\operatorname{lcm}(\operatorname{lcm}(x,y),z)=
\operatorname{lcm}(x,\operatorname{lcm}(y,z))=
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y,z)\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{ for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

*Because [[linear transformation]]s are functions that can be represented by matrices with [[matrix multiplication]] being the representation of functional composition, one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative.

* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]:
:: &lt;math&gt;

\left.
\begin{matrix}
(A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap(B\cap C)=A\cap B\cap C\quad
\\
(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C)=A\cup B\cup C\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{for all sets }A,B,C.
&lt;/math&gt;

* If ''M'' is some set and ''S'' denotes the set of all functions from ''M'' to ''M'', then the operation of [[functional composition]] on ''S'' is associative:

:: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h\qquad\mbox{for all }f,g,h\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

* Slightly more generally, given four sets ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'', with ''h'': ''M'' to ''N'', ''g'': ''N'' to ''P'', and ''f'': ''P'' to ''Q'', then

:: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h&lt;/math&gt;

: as before. In short, composition of maps is always associative.

* Consider a set with three elements, A, B, and C. The following operation:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
| +
|-
! × !! A !! B !! C
|-
! A
| A || A || A
|-
! B
| A || B || C
|-
! C
| A || A || A
|-
|}

is associative. Thus, for example, A(BC)=(AB)C. This mapping is not commutative.

== Non-associativity ==

A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a set ''S'' that does not satisfy the associative law is called '''non-associative'''. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z\ne x*(y*z)\qquad\mbox{for some }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

For such an operation the order of evaluation ''does'' matter. For example:

* [[Subtraction]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(5-3)-2 \, \ne \, 5-(3-2)
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Division (mathematics)|Division]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(4/2)/2 \, \ne \, 4/(2/2)
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Exponentiation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
2^{(1^2)} \, \ne \, (2^1)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Also note that infinite sums are not generally associative, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+\dots \, = \, 0
&lt;/math&gt;
whereas
:&lt;math&gt;
1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+\dots \, = \, 1
&lt;/math&gt;

The study of non-associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra. One area within non-associative algebra that has grown very large is that of [[Lie algebra]]s. There the associative law is replaced by the [[Jacobi identity]]. Lie algebras abstract the essential nature of [[infinitesimal transformation]]s, and have become ubiquitous in mathematics. They are an example of [[non-associative algebra]]s.

There are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth. They tend to come from some specific applications. Some of these arise in [[combinatorial mathematics]].  Other examples: [[Quasigroup]], [[Quasifield]], [[Nonassociative ring]].

=== Notation for non-associative operations ===
{{main|Operator associativity}}

In general, parentheses must be used to indicate the [[order of operations|order of evaluation]] if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression. However, [[mathematician]]s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses.

A '''left-associative''' operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
x*y*z=(x*y)*z\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\\
w*x*y*z=((w*x)*y)*z\quad
\\
\mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
&lt;/math&gt;
while a '''right-associative''' operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
x*y*z=x*(y*z)\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\\
w*x*y*z=w*(x*(y*z))\quad
\\
\mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
&lt;/math&gt;
Both left-associative and right-associative operations occur.  Left-associative operations include the following:

*Subtraction and division of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x-y-z=(x-y)-z\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R};&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x/y/z=(x/y)/z\qquad\qquad\quad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}\mbox{ with }y\ne0,z\ne0.&lt;/math&gt;

*Function application:
::&lt;math&gt;(f \, x \, y) = ((f \, x) \, y)&lt;/math&gt;
:This notation can be motivated by the [[currying]] isomorphism.

Right-associative operations include the following:

*[[Exponentiation]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x^{y^z}=x^{(y^z)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

:The reason exponentiation is right-associative is that a repeated left-associative exponentiation operation would be less useful. Multiple appearances could (and would) be rewritten with multiplication:

::&lt;math&gt;(x^y)^z=x^{(yz)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Function (mathematics)|Function definition]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z} \rarr (\mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto y \mapsto x - y = x \mapsto (y \mapsto x - y)&lt;/math&gt;

:Using right-associative notation for these operations can be motivated by the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]] and by the [[currying]] isomorphism.

Non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following.

*Taking the [[Cross product]] of three vectors:
::&lt;math&gt;\vec a \times (\vec b \times \vec c) \neq (\vec a \times \vec b ) \times \vec c \qquad \mbox{ for some } \vec a,\vec b,\vec c \in \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;

*Taking the pairwise [[average]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;{(x+y)/2+z\over2}\ne{x+(y+z)/2\over2} \qquad \mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R} \mbox{ with }x\ne z.&lt;/math&gt;
*Taking the [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of sets:
::&lt;math&gt;(A\backslash B)\backslash C\ne A\backslash (B\backslash C)\qquad\mbox{for some sets }A,B,C.&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;div style=&quot;width: 360px; float: left; margin: 0 2em 0 0; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;[[File:RelativeComplement.png|Venn diagram of the relative complements (A\B)\C and A\(B\C)]]&lt;/div&gt;

The green part in the left [[Venn diagram]] represents &lt;math&gt;(A\backslash B)\backslash C&lt;/math&gt;. The green part in the right [[Venn diagram]] represents &lt;math&gt;A\backslash(B\backslash C)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot; /&gt;

The '''Apache Software Foundation''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|p|æ|ʧ|.|i}}; '''ASF''') is a non-profit corporation (classified as [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the [[Apache HTTP Server]]. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and [[Delaware corporation|incorporated in Delaware]], U.S., in June 1999.&lt;ref name=incorporation&gt;

The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the [[Apache License]] and is therefore [[free and open source software]] (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a [[meritocracy]], implying that membership to the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation&lt;ref&gt;[[François Letellier]], see 'Third Generation Open Source'&lt;/ref&gt; open-source organization.

Among the ASF's objectives are to provide legal protection&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [[Volunteer Protection Act]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; to volunteers working on Apache projects, and to prevent the ''Apache'' brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.

The ASF also holds several [http://www.apachecon.com/ ApacheCon] conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects, related technology, and encouraging Apache developers to gather together.

==History==
The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, the work on which started in 1994. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the [[NCSA HTTPd]] daemon. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed.&lt;ref name=incorporation/&gt; The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999, and by general consent that the initial membership list of the Apache Software Foundation, would be: [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Ken Coar]], Mark Cox, Lars Eilebrecht, Ralf S. Engelschall, [[Roy Fielding|Roy T. Fielding]], Dean Gaudet, Ben Hyde, [[Jim Jagielski]], Alexei Kosut, Martin Kraemer, [[Ben Laurie]], Doug MacEachern, Aram Mirzadeh, [[Sameer Parekh]], Cliff Skolnick, Marc Slemko, William (Bill) Stoddard, Paul Sutton, Randy Terbush and Dirk-Willem van Gulik.&lt;ref name=firstMeeting&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate  = 2009-05-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation, the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June 1, 1999.&lt;ref name=effDate/&gt;

==Projects==
{{See also|List of Apache Software Foundation Projects}}
Apache divides its [[software development]] activities into separate semi-autonomous areas called projects, some of which have a number of sub-projects. Unlike other organizations that host FOSS projects, before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be given to the ASF. In this way the ASF controls the intellectual property of all its projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= St. Amant|first=Kirk|coauthor=Brian Still|title=Handbook of research on open source software: technological, economic, and social perspectives|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|year=2007|pages=217–219|isbn=9781591409991|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=75KT6GdcWbYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22apache+foundation%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22apache%20foundation%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
The ASF board of directors has responsibility for overseeing the ASF's activities and acting as a central point of contact and communication for its projects. The board assigns corporate issues, assigning resources to projects, and manages corporate services, including funds and legal issues. It does not make technical decisions about individual projects; these are made by the individual Project Management Committees. The board is elected annually by members of the foundation and, as of October 2010, it consists of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990'''&lt;ref name=ada90&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/americans_with_disabilities_act_of_1990_ada_42_u_s_code_chapter_126 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|101|336|104|327|1990|07|26}}, codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12101}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ADA) is a law that was enacted by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1990.  It was [[sign into law|signed into law]] on July 26, 1990, by [[George H. W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]], and later amended with changes effective January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= President Bush Signs ADA Changes into Law | date= 2008-09-25 | publisher= HR.BLR.com | url= http://hr.blr.com/news.aspx?id=78926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADA is a wide-ranging [[civil rights]] law that prohibits, under certain circumstances, [[discrimination]] based on [[disability]].  It affords similar protections against discrimination to [[Americans with disabilities]] as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5lHSBSuc4|date =2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made discrimination based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[gender|sex]], national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Disability is defined by the ADA as &quot;a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.&quot; The determination of whether any particular condition is considered a disability is made on a case by case basis. Certain specific conditions are excluded as disabilities, such as current substance abuse and visual impairment which is correctable by prescription lenses.

On September 25, 2008, President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]] (ADAAA). This was intended to give broader protections for disabled workers and &quot;turn back the clock&quot; on court rulings which Congress deemed too restrictive.&lt;ref name=BLR&gt;{{cite web| title= ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA)—What Employers Need to Know | year= 2008 | publisher= HR.BLR.com | url= http://www.blr.com/information-ada/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADAAA includes a list of &quot;major life activities.&quot;

==Titles of the ADA==
===Title I - Employment===
:''See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111|12117}}.''
[[File:President George H W Bush Signing of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) Bill 1990.gif|thumb|right|Speech cards used by President George H. W. Bush at the signing ceremony of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on July 26, 1990.&lt;ref name=ada90/&gt;]]

The ADA states that a ''covered entity'' shall not discriminate against ''a qualified individual with a disability''.&lt;ref name=&quot;12112a&quot;&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies to [[application for employment|job application]] procedures, hiring, advancement and discharge of employees, [[workers' compensation]], job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. ''Covered entity'' can refer to an [[employment agency]], [[labor organization]], or joint [[labor-management]] committee, and is generally an employer engaged in interstate commerce and having 15 or more workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination may include, among other things, limiting or classifying a job applicant or employee in an adverse way, denying employment opportunities to people who truly qualify, or not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of disabled employees, not advancing employees with disabilities in the business, and/or not providing needed accommodations in training. Employers can use medical entrance examinations for applicants, after making the job offer, only if ''all'' applicants (regardless of disability) must take it and it is treated as a confidential [[medical record]]. ''Qualified individuals'' do not include any employee or applicant who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when that usage is the basis for the employer's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as it pertains to states in the case of ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' as violating the [[sovereign immunity]] rights of the several states as specified by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The provision allowing private suits against states for [[money damages]] was invalidated.

===Title II - Public Entities (and public transportation)===
:''See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12131|12165}}.''
[[File:Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|thumb|left|75px|Access sign]]

Title II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local (''i.e.'' school district, municipal, city, county) and state level. Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. These regulations cover access to all programs  and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.

Title II also applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]].  It includes the [[Amtrak|National Railroad Passenger Corporation]], along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services.
{{clearleft}}

===Title III - Public Accommodations (and Commercial Facilities)===
:''See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12181|12189}}.''

Under Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal [[enjoyment]] of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of ''public accommodation'' by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of ''public accommodation''. &quot;Public accommodations&quot; include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays, among other things.

Under Title III of the ADA, all &quot;new construction&quot; (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the [[Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines]] (&quot;ADAAG&quot;)&lt;ref name=ada90/&gt; found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at 28&amp;nbsp;C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix &quot;A.&quot;

Title III also has application to existing facilities.  One of the definitions of &quot;discrimination&quot; under Title III of the ADA is a &quot;failure to remove&quot; architectural barriers in existing facilities. See {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|42|12182|b|2|A|iv}}. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether &quot;removing barriers&quot; (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is &quot;readily achievable,&quot; defined as &quot;easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense.&quot;

The statutory definition of &quot;readily achievable&quot; calls for a [[balancing test]] between the cost of the proposed &quot;fix&quot; and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be &quot;readily achievable&quot; for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.

There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], or properties designated as historic under State or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the &quot;maximum extent feasible&quot; but if following the usual standards would &quot;threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building&quot; then alternative standards may be used. Nonetheless, as [[Frank Bowe]] predicted when he testified as the lead witness on Title III in the Senate hearings leading up to enactment{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, the fact that Title III calls for accessibility in, and alterations to, thousands of stores, restaurants, hotels, etc., in thousands of communities across the U.S. means that this Title probably has had more effect on the lives of more Americans with disabilities than any other ADA title.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title IV - Telecommunications===
Title IV of the ADA amended the landmark [[Communications Act of 1934]] primarily by adding section {{UnitedStatesCode|47|225}}.  This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments.  When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to installation of public [[Teletypewriter]] (TTY) machines and other TDDs ([[Telecommunications Device for the Deaf]]). Title IV also led to creation, in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as [[Telecommunications Relay Services]] (TRS), such as [[STS Relay]].  Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections.  Some are [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed/typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others.  In 2006, according to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.

===Title V - Miscellaneous Provisions===
:''See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12201|12213}}.''

Title V includes technical provisions.  It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in [[Section 504]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Title V includes an anti retaliation or coercion provision.  The Technical Assistance Manual for the ADA explains it: &quot;III-3.6000 Retaliation or coercion. Individuals who exercise their rights under the ADA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights . . . Any form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere.

==Major life activities==
The ADA defines a covered disability as &quot;a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.&quot; The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment.  Its regulations narrowed &quot;substantially limits&quot; to &quot;significantly or severely restricts&quot;.

In 2008, effective January 1, 2009, the ADAAA broadened the interpretations and added to the ADA examples of &quot;major life activities&quot; including, but not limited to, &quot;caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working&quot; as well as the operation of several specified &quot;major bodily functions.&quot;&lt;ref name=BLR /&gt; The Act overturns a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court case which held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures. Another court restriction overturned is the interpretation that an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.&lt;ref name=BLR /&gt;

The ADAAA will undoubtedly lead to broader coverage of impaired employees.  The [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor]] states that the amendment &quot;makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability&quot;.&lt;ref name=HouseCommittee&gt;{{cite web| author= House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor | title= The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 | url= http://edlabor.house.gov/issues/adaaa.shtml#1 | quote= BROKEN LINK}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Required doctor visits are not to be held against anyone with a disability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Political pressure==
The ADA (1990) is unusual because more than a hundred groups dedicated to [[disability rights]], [[civil rights]], and [[social justice]] worked together to ensure its passage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Opposition from religious groups===
The debate over the Americans with Disabilities Act led some religious groups to take opposite positions.&lt;ref&gt; Lawton, K.A. ''Christianity Today'', 10/8/90, Vol. 34 Issue 14, p71&lt;/ref&gt;  Some religious groups, such as the Association of Christian Schools International, opposed the ADA in its original form.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Should the Senate Approve the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989?&quot; [[Congressional Digest]] December (1989): 297&lt;/ref&gt;  ACSI opposed the Act primarily because the ADA labeled religious institutions “public accommodations,” and thus would have required churches to make costly structural changes to ensure access for all.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Should the Senate Approve the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989?&quot; [[Congressional Digest]] December (1989): 297.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the cost argument advanced by ACSI and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as “public accommodations,” and thus churches were permitted to remain inaccessible if they choose.

In addition to opposing the ADA on grounds of cost, church groups like the National Association of Evangelicals testified against the ADA’s Title I (employment) provisions on grounds of religious liberty.  The NAE felt that the regulation of the internal employment of churches was &quot;... an improper intrusion [of] the federal government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, K.A. ''Christianity Today'', 10/8/90, Vol. 34 Issue 14, p71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition from business interests===
Many members of the business community opposed the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Testifying before Congress, Greyhound Bus Lines stated that the Act had the potential to “deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world.”  The US Chamber of Congress argued that the costs of the ADA would be “enormous” and have “a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to survive”.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Should the Senate Approve the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989?&quot; [[Congressional Digest]] December (1989): 208. &lt;/ref&gt;  The National Federation of Independent Businesses, an organization that lobbies for small businesses, called the ADA “a disaster for small business.”&lt;ref&gt; Mandel, Susan. &quot;Disabling the GOP.&quot; The National Review 6/11/1990, Vol. 42 Issue 11, p23-24 &lt;/ref&gt;  Pro-business conservative commentators joined in opposition, writing that the Americans with Disabilities Act was “an expensive headache to millions” that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt; Doherty, Brian. Reason, Aug/Sep95, Vol. 27 Issue 4, p18 &lt;/ref&gt;

On signing the measure, [[George H. W. Bush]] said: {{quote|I know there may have been concerns that the ADA may be too vague or too costly, or may lead endlessly to litigation. But I want to reassure you right now that my administration and the United States Congress have carefully crafted this Act. We've all been determined to ensure that it gives flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetable of implementation; and we've been committed to containing the costs that may be incurred.... Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/ada/bushspeech.html The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the debate of what it means to be disabled, Joan Aleshire{{Who|date=December 2009}} stated in the book ''Voices From the Edge'': {{quote|If the definition of disability is the inability to do the common daily tasks of life—getting out of bed, washing, dressing, eating, going to the bathroom—and working at one’s age level in school, I’ve never really been disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= |first=

About the importance of making employment opportunities inclusive, Shirley Davis, director of global diversity and inclusion at the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], said:{{quote|People with disabilities represent a critical talent pool that is underserved and underutilized.&lt;ref&gt;
([http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/Diversity/Articles/Pages/ManagerswithDisabilities.aspx Targeted Development for Managers with Disabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
===Employment===
The ADA has been a frequent target of criticism.  For example, a common claim is that individuals who are diagnosed with one of the so-called &quot;lesser disabilities&quot; are  being &quot;accommodated&quot; when they should not be.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} On the other hand, court decisions have made necessary &quot;an individualized assessment to prove that an impairment is protected under the ADA. Therefore, the plaintiff must offer evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial in terms of his or her own experience;&quot; a medical diagnosis or physician's declaration of disability is no longer enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Vierling | first = Lewis E. | year = 2004 | month = January | title = Proving disability remains difficult | journal = The Case Manager | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–29 | publisher = | doi = 10.1016/j.casemgr.2003.10.013| id =  | url = http://www.thecsmgr.com/article/PIIS1061925903003096/fulltext | accessdate = 2009-02-21 | quote = | pmid = 14961012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most people never have their discrimination cases heard in court because of the difficulty of getting past the first step.

Even those who support the intent of the law worry that it might have [[unintended consequence]]s.  Among other arguments, supporters hypothesize that the Act creates additional legal risks for employers who then quietly avoid hiring people with disabilities to avoid this risk. And such researchers&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., DeLeire, 2000; Acemoglu &amp; Angrist, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; claim to have documented a sharp drop in employment among individuals with a disability after passage of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;(see Schwochau &amp; Blanck for counter arguments)&lt;/ref&gt;  Others believe that the law has been ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;(see Schall, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Professional plaintiffs&quot;===
The ADA allows private plaintiffs to receive only [[injunctive relief]] (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys' fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non-compliant businesses.  Unless a state law, such as the California [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]],&lt;ref name=&quot;time ada&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1866666,00.html|title=Lawsuits by the Disabled: Abuse of the System?|author=Stateman, Alison|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=TIME | date=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs, persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ADA.

Thus, &quot;professional plaintiffs&quot; are typically found in states that have enacted state laws that allow private individuals to win monetary awards from non-compliant businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;time ada&quot;/&gt; At least one of these plaintiffs in California has been barred by courts from filing lawsuits unless he receives prior court permission.&lt;ref name=&quot;time ada&quot;/&gt; The attorneys' fees provision of Title III does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial ADA litigation, but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain financial reward from attorneys' fees unless they act as their own attorney, or as mentioned above, a disabled plaintiff resides in a state which provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits. Moreover, there may be a benefit to these &quot;private attorneys general&quot; who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities.  “Civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement.  Moreover, the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the ADA.”&lt;ref&gt;Parr v. L &amp; L Drive-Inn Restaurant  (D. Hawaii  2000) 96&amp;nbsp;F.Supp.2d 1065, 1082, citing and quoting, Committee Print, Vol. II, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., at 1481-82 (1990);  {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12101}}(b)(2); S.Rep. No. 101-116, at 15 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have noted: “As a result, most ADA suits are brought by a small number of private plaintiffs who view themselves as champions of the disabled. For the ADA to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled, it may indeed be  necessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the ADA.”&lt;ref&gt;Molski v. Evergreen Dynasty Corp., (9th Cir. 2007) 500&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1047, 1062; D'Lil v. Best Western Encina Lodge &amp; Suites  (9th Cir. 2008) 538&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1031, 1040.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ADA case law==
There have been some notable cases regarding the ADA. For example, two major hotel room marketers (Expedia.com and Hotels.com) with their business presence on the Internet were sued because its customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms through their websites without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dralegal.org/search/Disability Rights Advocates] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These represent a major potential expansion of the ADA in that this, and other similar suits (known as &quot;bricks vs. clicks&quot;), seeks to expand the ADA's authority to [[cyberspace]], where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply.

''[[National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation]]''

This is a case where a major retailer, [[Target Corp.]], was sued because their web designers failed to design its website to enable persons with low or no vision to use it.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.dralegal.org/cases/private_business/nfb_v_target.php National Federation for the Blind v. Target] at Disability Rights Advocates&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]''

Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case about [[United States Congress|Congress's]] [[congressional power of enforcement|enforcement powers]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].  It decided that Title I of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed states to be sued by private citizens for [[money damages]].

''Barden v. The City of Sacramento''

Another example, filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the ADA when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA.  Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court.  One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] which ruled that sidewalks were a &quot;program&quot; under ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities.  The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dralegal.org/cases/public_entities/barden_v_sacramento.php Barden v. Sacramento] from Disability Rights Advocates&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.]]''

This was a case that was decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 2005.  The defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation was exempt from the requirements of the ADA.  This argument was accepted by a federal court in Florida and, subsequently, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that Norwegian Cruise Lines was a business headquartered in the United States whose clients were predominantly Americans and, more importantly, operated out of port facilities throughout the United States.

''[[Olmstead, Commissioner, Georgia Department of Human Resources, et al. v. L. C., by zimring, guardian ad litem and next friend, et al.]]'' (not to be confused with ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', 277 U.S. 438 (1928), a case regarding wiretapping)

This was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1999. The two plaintiffs L.C. and E.W. were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia. Clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution.  The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community based treatment facilities.

The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it &quot;perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.&quot; The court added that &quot;confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.&quot;

Therefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-536.ZS.html OLMSTEAD V. L. C.] from [[Cornell University Law School]] - Syllabus for the Supreme Court Decision in 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v. The University of Michigan''

This was a case filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division on behalf of the Michigan [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]] against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium claiming that [[Michigan Stadium]] violated the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas.  The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of [[The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein]] in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, Robin. “U-M fans rave about new seats for disabled.” Detroit Free Press. 9 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats.  This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules.&lt;ref name=wolffe&gt;Wolffe, Jerry. “New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M’s Big House.” The Oakland Press. 14 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Wolffe, Jerry. “New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M’s Big House.” The Oakland Press. 14 September 2008. /&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paralyzed Veterans of America (or “PVA”) v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers''

One of the first major ADA lawsuits, Paralyzed Veterans of America (or “PVA”) v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers, Inc., was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design Phase, [[MCI Center]] in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces.  While Section 4.33.3  of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons.  The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects &amp; Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing.  This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.

''[[Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams]]’’

Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, [[Case citation|534 U.S. 184]] (2002) was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase &quot;substantially impairs&quot; as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed the decision by the Sixth Court of Appeals to grant a partial [[summary judgment]] in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the &quot;major life activity&quot; definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis  on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found Williams to be disabled.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;{{cite web

''[[Access Now v. Southwest Airlines]]''

Access Now v. Southwest Airlines was a case where the [[United States district court|District Court]] decided that the website of [[Southwest Airlines]] was not in violation of the Americans with Disability Act because the ADA is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace. Judge [[Patricia A. Seitz]] found that the &quot;virtual ticket counter&quot; of the website was a virtual construct and hence not a &quot;public place of accommodation.&quot; As such, &quot;To expand the ADA to cover 'virtual' spaces would be to create new rights without well-defined standards.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CLR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss | work = Tech Law Journal | url = http://www.techlawjournal.com/courts2002/accessnow_southwest/20021018.asp | accessdate = 25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apple I''', also known as the '''Apple-1''', was an early [[personal computer]].  They were designed and [[Handicraft|hand-built]] by [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioltechnology.co.za/article_page.php?iSectionId=2892&amp;iArticleId=3456594 IOL Technology - Co-founder tells his side of Apple story]{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6167297 NPR : A Chat with Computing Pioneer Steve Wozniak]&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak's friend [[Steve Jobs]] had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s first product, demonstrated in April 1976 at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in Palo Alto, California.

==History==
The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of {{USD|666.66}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-5937610.html|title=Video: Wozniak: $666.66 seemed like a good idea|date=2005-11-07|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Wozniak liked repeating digits&lt;ref name=&quot;iWoz&quot;&gt;[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, Steven]]: &quot;[[iWoz]]&quot;, page 180. [[W. W. Norton]], 2006. ISBN 978-0-393-06143-7&lt;/ref&gt; and because they originally sold it to a local shop for $500 and added a one-third markup. About 200 units were produced. Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 60+ chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply transformers, power switch, ASCII keyboard, and composite video display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at a cost of $75.

[[File:Apple 1 Advertisement Oct 1976.jpg | thumb | left | Introductory advertisement for the Apple I Computer]]
The Apple I's built-in [[computer terminal]] circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and an inexpensive [[television set]]. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a [[ASR33|teletypewriter machine]]. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703 April 1977 Price List | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It  continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the [[Apple II]] in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2715 Bill of Sale | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple  dropped the Apple I from its price list by October 1977, officially discontinuing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707 October 1977 Price List | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers, contributing to their scarcity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ah04&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | title=The Apple II, cont. | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | work=Apple II History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, an estimated 40 to 50 Apple I computers are still known to exist, making it a very rare [[collectable|collector's item]]. An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 USD at auction in 1999, with another apparently selling in 2009 for $17,500; however, a more typical price for an Apple I is in the $14,000&amp;ndash;$16,000 range.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In November 2009 the Apple I with serial number 82 was listed on eBay with a starting bid of $50,000 but it is unreported as to whether the computer was sold. However, in November 2010, this same Apple I (with serial number 82) sold for the equivalent of $US178,000 ($US213,600 including the 'buyer's premium') at Christie's auction house in London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11825954 BBC News 24 November 2010 00:48]&lt;/ref&gt;, making it by far the highest price paid for this model to date, at {{GBP|133,250}} ($210,000). The high value of this particular example is likely due to the rare documents and packaging offered in the sale rather than the computer itself; namely (and amongst others) the original packaging (with the return label showing Steve Jobs' parents' address, the original Apple Computer Inc 'headquarters' being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer) and the original invoice showing 'Steven' as the salesman. The computer was brought to Turin University where it was used to run BASIC.

==Emulators, clones, and replicas==
A software-compatible clone of the Apple I ([[Replica 1]]) produced using modern components, was released in 2003 at a price of around $200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/briel replica I - the apple I(c) clone], retrieved 2009-08-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brielcomputers.com/wordpress/?cat=4 replica I] at official Briel computers web site, retrieved 2008-08-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, Ken [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136257/Image_gallery_Building_an_Apple_1_replica_from_scratch Image gallery: Building an Apple-1 replica from scratch], ''[[Computerworld]]'', 2009-08-14, story with pictures for assembling a Briel replica I from a kit, retrieved 2009-08-15&lt;/ref&gt; Other replicas and do-it-yourself kits and instructions are available.&lt;ref&gt;Owad, Tom ''[http://www.applefritter.com/replica Apple I Replica Creation]'', retrieved 2009-08-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbprojects.com/projects/apple1/ A-one], retrieved 2009-08-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The composite term ''Apatosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] names ''apate'' ({{Polytonic|ἀπάτη}})/''apatelos'' ({{Polytonic|ἀπατηλός}}) meaning &quot;deception&quot;/&quot;deceptive&quot; and ''sauros'' ({{Polytonic|[[wikt:σαῦρος|σαῦρος]]}}) meaning &quot;lizard&quot;; thus, &quot;deceptive lizard&quot;. [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] gave it this name because he regarded the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevron bones]] as similar to those of some [[mosasaur]]s, members of a group of prehistoric marine lizards.

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of ''[[Diplodocus]]'' and the bones of the leg were much stockier (despite being longer), implying a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like most sauropods, ''Apatosaurus'' had only a single large claw on each forelimb, with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws.

[[Fossil]]s of these animals have been found in [[Bone Cabin Quarry#Nine Mile Quarry|Nine Mile Quarry]] and [[Bone Cabin Quarry]] in [[Wyoming]] and at sites in [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Utah]], present in stratigraphic zones 2-6.&lt;ref name=&quot;foster-appendix&quot;&gt;Foster, J.

The skull was small in comparison with the size of the animal. The jaws were lined with spatulate teeth, which resembled chisels, suited to an herbivorous diet. Like other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck were deeply bifurcated; that is, they carried paired spines, creating a wide and deep profile for the neck.&lt;ref name=dinonathist&gt;Fasovsky, D.E. and Weishampel, D.B.

''Apatosaurus'', like its close relative ''[[Supersaurus]]'', is notable for the incredibly tall spines on its vertebrae, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones. Also unusual among diplodocids is the shape of the tail, which is comparatively thin in breadth and short in height, a profile caused by the vertebral spines decreasing in height rapidly the farther they are from the hips. ''Apatosaurus'' also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. The limb bones were also very robust.&lt;ref name=LHW07&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovelace |first=David M. |coauthors=Hartman, Scott A.; and Wahl, William R. |year=2007 |title=Morphology of a specimen of ''Supersaurus'' (Dinosauria, Sauropoda) from the Morrison Formation of Wyoming, and a re-evaluation of diplodocid phylogeny |journal=Arquivos do Museu Nacional |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=527–544 | url = http://server1.bhbfonline.org/Specimens/CLPV_II_Supersaurus.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] published the name of the [[type species]] ''Apatosaurus ajax''. He followed this in 1879 with a description of another, more complete specimen, which he thought represented a new [[genus]] and [[species]], which he named ''Brontosaurus excelsus''. In 1903, [[Elmer Riggs]] re-examined the fossils. While he agreed with Marsh that ''Brontosaurus excelsus'' was likely a distinct species, he also noted many similarities between ''B. excelsus'' and ''A. ajax'', and decided that both should be placed in the same genus. Riggs re-classified the species as ''Apatosaurus excelsus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;riggs-1903&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all paleontologists since Riggs published his opinions have agreed that the two species should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name ''Apatosaurus'', having been published first, had priority as the official name; ''Brontosaurus'' is considered a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] and has therefore been discarded from formal use.

''Apatosaurus ajax'' is the [[type species]] of the genus, and was named by the [[paleontologist]] [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1877 after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], the [[hero]] from [[Greek mythology]]. It is the [[holotype]] for the genus and two partial skeletons have been found, including part of a [[skull]]. ''Apatosaurus excelsus'' (originally ''Brontosaurus'') was named by Marsh in 1879. It is known from six partial skeletons, including part of a skull, which have been found in the [[United States]], in [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]]. ''Apatosaurus louisae'' was named by William Holland in 1915 in honor of Mrs. Louise Carnegie, wife of [[Andrew Carnegie]] who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. ''Apatosaurus louisae'' is known from one partial skeleton which was found in [[Utah]] in the United States. ''Apatosaurus parvus'' was originally known as ''Elosaurus parvus'', but was reclassified as a species of ''Apatosaurus'' in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM94&quot;&gt;Carpenter, K. and McIntosh, J.

''Apatosaurus yahnahpin'' was named by Filla and Redman in 1994. [[Robert T.

==History==
[[File:Sharp lull brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Original (outdated) ''A. excelsus'' skeletal mount at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]]]]
[[Othniel Charles Marsh]], a Professor of [[Paleontology]] at [[Yale University]], described and named an incomplete (and juvenile) skeleton of ''Apatosaurus ajax'' in 1877. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at [[Como Bluff]] [[Wyoming]]—which, because of discrepancies including the size difference, Marsh incorrectly identified as belonging to an entirely new [[genus]] and [[species]]. He dubbed the new species ''Brontosaurus excelsus'', meaning &quot;thunder lizard&quot;, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] '''brontē/βροντη''' meaning 'thunder' and '''sauros/σαυρος''' meaning 'lizard', and from the [[Latin]] ''excelsus'', &quot;highest, sublime&quot;, referring to the greater number of sacral vertebrae than in any other genus of sauropod known at the time.
[[File:Apatosaurus excelsus.jpg|thumb|Current ''A. excelsus'' skeletal mount at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
The finds—the largest dinosaur ever discovered at the time and nearly complete, lacking only a head, feet, and portions of the tail — were then prepared for what was to be the first ever mounted display of a sauropod skeleton, at Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in 1905. The missing bones were created using known pieces from close relatives of ''Brontosaurus''. Sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry were added, as well as a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it should, as well as a composite model of what he felt the skull of this massive creature might look like. This was not a delicate ''[[Diplodocus]]''-style skull (which would later turn out to be more accurate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = McIntosh, J.S. and Berman, D.S. | year = 1975 | title = Description of the palate and lower jaw of the sauropod dinosaur ''Diplodocus'' (Reptilia: Saurischia) with remarks on the nature of the skull of ''Apatosaurus'' | url =http://www.jstor.org/pss/1303324  | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), but was composed of &quot;the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakker&quot;&gt;Bakker, Robert (1994). &quot;The Bite of the Bronto&quot; ''Earth'' 3:(6):26–33.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily those of ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. This method of reconstructing incomplete skeletons based on the more complete remains of related dinosaurs continues in museum mounts and life restorations to this day.

Despite the much-publicized debut of the mounted skeleton, which cemented the name ''Brontosaurus'' in the public consciousness, [[Elmer Riggs]] had published a paper in the 1903 edition of ''Geological Series of the Field Columbian Museum'' which argued that ''Brontosaurus'' was not different enough from ''Apatosaurus'' to warrant its own genus, and created the combination ''Apatosaurus excelsus'': &quot;In view of these facts the two genera may be regarded as synonymous. As the term 'Apatosaurus' has priority, 'Brontosaurus' will be regarded as a synonym.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;riggs-1903&quot; /&gt;

Despite this, at least one paleontologist—[[Robert Bakker]]—argued in the 1990s that ''A. ajax'' and ''A. excelsus'' are in fact sufficiently distinct that the latter continues to merit a separate genus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakker98&quot;&gt;Bakker, R.T.

Early on, it was believed that ''Apatosaurus'' was too massive to support its own weight on dry land, so it was theorized that the sauropod must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in a swamp. Recent findings do not support this. In fact, like its relative ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''Apatosaurus'' was a [[grazing]] animal with a very long neck and a long tail that served as a counterweight. One study suggested that diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, and that sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;StevensParrish99&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Stevens| first = Kent A.| authorlink = | title = Neck Posture and Feeding Habits of Two Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs| journal = Science| volume = 284| issue = 5415| pages = 798–800| publisher = | location = | year = 1999| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/5415/798| doi = 10.1126/science.284.5415.798| id = | accessdate = 2008-08-03| pmid = 10221910| last2 = Parrish| first2 = JM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, footprints of juvenile ''Apatosaurus'' were reported from Quarry Five in Morrison, Colorado.

===Posture===
[[File:Apatosaurus33.jpg|thumb|Restoration]] 
In the early 20th century, [[diplodocidae|diplodocids]] like ''Apatosaurus'' were often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to graze from tall trees. More recently, scientists have argued that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain.

''Apatosaurus'', like ''Diplodocus'', would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Physiology===
Given the large body mass of ''Apatosaurus'', combined with its long neck, [[physiologist]]s have encountered problems determining how these animals managed to breathe.

Beginning with the assumption that ''Apatosaurus'', like [[crocodilia]]ns, did not have a diaphragm, the [[Dead space|dead-space volume]] (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about 184&amp;nbsp;liters for a 30 ton specimen.

Its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]] (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) has been calculated based on the following [[respiratory system]]s:
* 904&amp;nbsp;liters if avian
* 225&amp;nbsp;liters if mammalian
* 19&amp;nbsp;liters if reptilian.

On this basis, its [[respiratory system]] could not have been reptilian, as its tidal volume would not have been able to replace its dead-space volume. Likewise, the mammalian system would only provide a fraction of new air on each breath. Therefore, it must have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]], i.e. multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&amp;nbsp;liters compared to a mammalian requirement of 2,950&amp;nbsp;liters, which would exceed the available space. The overall thoracic volume of ''Apatosaurus'' has been estimated at 1,700&amp;nbsp;liters allowing for a 500-liter, four-chambered [[heart]] (like [[bird]]s, not three-chambered like [[reptile]]s) and a 900-liter lung capacity. That would allow about 300&amp;nbsp;liters for the necessary [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. Assuming ''Apatosaurus'' had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, it would need to consume only about 262&amp;nbsp;liters (69 gallons) of water per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;paladinoetal1997&quot;&gt;Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P.

===Tail===
An article that appeared in the November 1997 issue of ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' reported research into the mechanics of ''Apatosaurus'' tails by [[Nathan Myhrvold]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[Microsoft]]. Myhrvold carried out a [[computer simulation]] of the tail, which in diplodocids like ''Apatosaurus'' was a very long, tapering structure resembling a [[bullwhip]]. This computer modeling suggested that sauropods were capable of producing a whip-like cracking sound of over 200 [[decibels]],{{Dubious|date=September 2009}} comparable to the volume of a [[cannon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmer1997&quot;&gt;Zimmer, C.

The length of time taken for Marsh's misclassification to be brought to public notice meant that the name ''Brontosaurus'', associated as it was with one of the largest dinosaurs, became so famous that it persisted long after the name had officially been abandoned in scientific use.&lt;ref name=&quot;gould1991&quot;/&gt;

As late as 1989, the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] issued four &quot;dinosaur&quot; stamps, ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Pteranodon]]'' (which is a [[pterosaur]] and not a dinosaur) and ''Brontosaurus''. The inclusion of these last two led to complaints of &quot;fostering scientific illiteracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DC173CF932A25753C1A96F948260 &quot; Topics of The Times; Leapin' Lizards!&quot;] ''The New York Times'', 1989-10-11. Retrieved 2008-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The Post Office defended itself (in Postal Bulletin 21744) by saying, &quot;Although now recognized by the scientific community as ''Apatosaurus'', the name 'Brontosaurus' was used for the stamp because it is more familiar to the general population.&quot; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] supported this position in his essay &quot;[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]&quot;, though he echoed Riggs' original argument that ''Brontosaurus'' is a synonym for ''Apatosaurus''. Nevertheless, he noted that the former has developed and continues to maintain an independent existence in the popular imagination.&lt;ref name=&quot;gould1991&quot;&gt;Gould, S.J. (1991).

[[Image:Gertie the Dinosaur.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6:58|left|Gertie the Dinosaur, featuring an animated ''Brontosaurus'']]
''Brontosaurus'' has often been depicted in cinema, beginning with [[Winsor McCay|Winsor McKay]]'s 1914 classic ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''. The 1925 silent film [[The Lost World (1925 film)|''The Lost World'']] featured, using [[special effects]] by [[Willis O'Brien]], a battle between a ''Brontosaurus'' and an ''[[Allosaurus]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} but the former inaccurately had a very bendy neck. When [[George Lucas]] made his special edition of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' in 1997, he added some large, long-necked animals based on the ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' digital model from the earlier film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. At an early stage he altered the CG department's suggested name &quot;Bronto&quot;, taken from ''Brontosaurus'', to '[[List of Star Wars creatures#Ronto|Ronto]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;ronto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/creature/ronto/index.html|title=Ronto|work=Databank|publisher=Star Wars.com|accessdate=2009-01-13| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msNZIPEJ | archivedate = 2010-01-18| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinclair Oil]] has a long history of being a fixture on American roads (and briefly in other countries) with its green dinosaur logo and mascot, an ''Apatosaurus'' (''Brontosaurus''). While Sinclair's early advertising included a number of different dinosaurs, eventually only ''Apatosaurus'' was used as the official logo, due to its popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair Oil Corporation, (2008).

'''''Allosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|l|ɵ|ˈ|s|ɔr|ə|s}}) is a [[genus]] of large [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived 155 to 150&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the [[late Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]] ([[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]]&lt;ref name=turner1999&gt;Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). &quot;Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A.&quot; Pp. 77–114 in Gillette, D.D. (ed.), ''Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah''. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.&lt;/ref&gt;). The name ''Allosaurus'' means &quot;different lizard&quot;. It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''ἅλλος''/''allos'' (&quot;different, other&quot;) and ''σαυρος''/''sauros'' (&quot;lizard&quot;). The first remains that can definitely be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of [[paleontology|paleontological]] circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several [[film]]s and [[documentary film|documentaries]].

''Allosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]]. Its [[skull]] was large and equipped with dozens of large, sharp [[teeth]]. It averaged {{convert|8.5|m|ft|sp=us}} in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over {{convert|12|m|ft|sp=us}}. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long, heavy tail. It is classified as an [[allosaurid]], a type of [[carnosauria]]n theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated [[taxonomy]], and includes an uncertain number of valid [[species]], the best known of which is ''A. fragilis''. The bulk of ''Allosaurus'' remains have come from [[North America]]'s [[Morrison Formation]], with material also known from [[Portugal]] and possibly [[Tanzania]]. It was known for over half of the 20th century as ''[[Antrodemus]]'', but study of the copious remains from the [[Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] brought the name ''Allosaurus'' back to prominence, and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.

As the most abundant large predator in the Morrison Formation, ''Allosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators (e.g. ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''). Potential prey included [[ornithopod]]s, [[stegosaurid]]s, and [[sauropod]]s. Some paleontologists interpret ''Allosaurus'' as having had cooperative [[social behavior]], and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a [[hatchet]].

==Description==
[[File:Allosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|The size range of ''Allosaurus'' and possible synonym ''Epanterias'' (largest), compared with a [[human]].]]
''Allosaurus'' was a typical large theropod, having a massive [[skull]] on a short [[neck]], a long [[tail]] and reduced forelimbs. ''Allosaurus fragilis'', the best-known species, had an average length of 8.5&amp;nbsp;meters (28&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=DFG97&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Allosaurus |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=Dinosaurs: The Encyclopedia |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |pages=105–117 |isbn=978-0-89950-917-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the largest definitive ''Allosaurus'' specimen ([[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]] 680) estimated at 9.7&amp;nbsp;meters long (32&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=MMDML03&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Dinosaur Mailing List |url=http://dml.cmnh.org/2003Jul/msg00355.html |title=And the largest Theropod is... |last=Mortimer |first=Mickey |date=2003-07-21 |accessdate=2007-09-08| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mpuYtaV2 | archivedate = 2010-01-16| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated weight of 2.3&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s (2.5&amp;nbsp;[[short ton]]s).&lt;ref name=MMDML03/&gt; In his 1976 [[monograph]] on ''Allosaurus'', James Madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of 12 to 13&amp;nbsp;meters (40 to 43&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=JM76&gt;{{cite book |last=Madsen |first=James H., Jr. |origyear=1976 |year=1993 |title=Allosaurus fragilis: A Revised Osteology |series=Utah Geological Survey Bulletin '''109''' |publisher=Utah Geological Survey |location=Salt Lake City |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between 1500&amp;nbsp;kilograms (3300&amp;nbsp;lb), 1000 to 4000&amp;nbsp;kilograms (2200 to 8800&amp;nbsp;lb), and 1010&amp;nbsp;kilograms (2230&amp;nbsp;lb) for [[mode (statistics)|modal]] adult weight (not maximum).&lt;ref name=JRF03&gt;{{cite book |last=Foster |first=John R. |year=2003 |title=Paleoecological Analysis of the Vertebrate Fauna of the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic), Rocky Mountain Region, U.S.A. |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |location=Albuquerque |series= New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin '''23''' |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that 1000&amp;nbsp;kg (2200&amp;nbsp;lb) is reasonable for large adults of ''A. fragilis'', but that 700&amp;nbsp;kg (1500&amp;nbsp;lb) is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized [[femur|thigh bones]] he has measured.&lt;ref name=JF07&gt;{{cite book |last=Foster | first=John |title=Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World |chapter=''Allosaurus fragilis'' |pages=170–176 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-34870-8 |year=2007 |oclc=77830875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the subadult specimen nicknamed &quot;Big Al&quot;, researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of {{convert|1500|kg|lb}} for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately {{convert|1400|kg|lb}} to approximately {{convert|2000|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=KTBetal09&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bates |first=Karl T. |coauthors=Falkingham, Peter L.; Breithaupt, Brent H.; Hodgetts, David; Sellers, William I.; and Manning, Phillip L. |year=2009 |title=How big was 'Big Al'?

Several gigantic specimens have been attributed to ''Allosaurus'', but may in fact belong to other genera. The closely related genus ''[[Saurophaganax]]'' ([[Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History|OMNH]] 1708) reached perhaps 10.9&amp;nbsp;meters (36&amp;nbsp;ft) in length,&lt;ref name=MMDML03/&gt; and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus ''Allosaurus'' as ''Allosaurus maximus'', though recent studies support it as a separate genus.&lt;ref name=DJC00&gt;{{cite book |last=Chure |first=Daniel J. |year=2000 |title=A new species of ''Allosaurus'' from the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Monument (Utah–Colorado) and a revision of the theropod family Allosauridae |series=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential specimen of ''Allosaurus'', once assigned to the genus ''[[Epanterias]]'' (AMNH 5767), may have measured 12.1&amp;nbsp;meters in length (40&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=MMDML03/&gt; A more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the Peterson Quarry in Morrison rocks of [[New Mexico]]; this large allosaurid may be another individual of ''Saurophaganax''.&lt;ref name=JF07b&gt;Foster, John. 2007.

===Skull===
[[File:Allosaurus-crane.jpg|thumb|Skull cast, [[Oklahoma Museum of Natural History]]]]
The skull and teeth of ''Allosaurus'' were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist [[Gregory S. Paul]] gives a length of 845&amp;nbsp;millimeters (33.3&amp;nbsp;in) for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at 7.9&amp;nbsp;meters long (26&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=GSP88&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |year=1988 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-61946-6 |chapter=Genus ''Allosaurus'' |pages=307–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[premaxilla]] (the bones that formed the tip of the snout), held five teeth with D-shaped cross-sections, and each [[maxilla]] (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth; the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone. Each [[dentary]] (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, more narrow, and more curved toward the back of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges. They were shed easily, and were replaced continually, making them common fossils.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt;

The skull had a pair of [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] above and in front of the eyes. These horns were composed of extensions of the [[lacrimal bone]]s,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the [[nasal bone]]s that led into the horns.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; The horns were probably covered in a [[keratin]] sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt;&lt;ref name=REM77&gt;{{cite journal |last=Molnar |first=Ralph E. |authorlink=Ralph Molnar |year=1977 |title=Analogies in the evolution of combat and display structures in ornithopods and ungulates |journal=Evolutionary Theory |volume=3 |pages=165–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although they were fragile).&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]].&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt;

Inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held [[gland]]s, such as [[salt gland]]s.&lt;ref name=DBN85&gt;{{cite book |last=Norman |first=David B. |authorlink=David B. Norman |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs: An Original and Compelling Insight into Life in the Dinosaur Kingdom |chapter='Carnosaurs' |year=1985 |publisher=Crescent Books |location=New York |pages=62–67 |isbn=978-0-517-46890-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the maxillae were [[Maxillary sinus|sinuses]] that were better developed than those of more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] theropods such as ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' and ''[[Marshosaurus]]''; they may have been related to the [[sense of smell]], perhaps holding something like [[vomeronasal organ|Jacobson's organ]]. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve [[thermoregulation]] for the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape.&lt;ref name=GSP88e&gt;Paul, Gregory S. (1988). ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World''. 91 and Figure 4–5 (93).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[braincase]] and [[frontal bone|frontals]] may also have had a joint.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt;

===Postcranial skeleton===
''Allosaurus'' had nine [[vertebra]]e in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the [[sacrum]] supporting the hips.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, 1976; note that not everyone agrees on where the neck ends and the back begins, and some authors such as Gregory S. Paul interpret the count as ten neck and thirteen back vertebrae.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less.&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; There were hollow spaces in the neck and [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] back vertebrae.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held [[Parabronchi|air sacs]] used in [[respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref name=HMC04&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtz |first=Thomas R., Jr. |authorlink=Thomas R.

''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World''. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' had [[gastralium|gastralia]] (belly ribs), but these are not common findings,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; and they may have [[ossification|ossified]] poorly.&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life.&lt;ref name=DJC00b&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chure |first=Daniel J. |year=2000 |title=Observations on the morphology and pathology of the gastral basket of ''Allosaurus'', based on a new specimen from Dinosaur National Monument |journal=Oryctos |volume=3 |pages=29–37|issn=1290-4805}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[furcula]] (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia.&lt;ref name=DJC00b/&gt;&lt;ref name=CM96&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1996.10011341 |last=Chure |first=Daniel J. |year=1996 |last2=Madsen |first2=James |title=On the presence of furculae in some non-maniraptoran theropods |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=16| issue=3 |pages=573–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], the main hip bone, was massive, and the [[pubis (bone)|pubic bone]] had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a [[sexual dimorphism|sexual characteristic]], with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.

==Classification==
[[File:Allosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration of ''Allosaurus fragilis''.]]
''Allosaurus'' was an allosaurid, a member of a [[family (biology)|family]] of large theropods within the larger group [[Carnosauria]]. The family name [[Allosauridae]] was created for this genus in 1878 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]],&lt;ref name=OCM78&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1878 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=15 |pages=241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of [[Megalosauridae]], another family of large theropods that eventually became a [[wastebasket taxon]]. This, along with the use of ''Antrodemus'' for ''Allosaurus'' during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on ''Allosaurus'' in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name Megalosauridae instead of Allosauridae include [[Charles Gilmore|Gilmore]], 1920,&lt;ref name=CWG20/&gt; [[Friedrich von Huene|von Huene]], 1926,&lt;ref name=FvH26&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Huene |first=Friedrich |year=1926 |title=The carnivorous Saurischia in the Jura and Cretaceous formations, principally in Europe |journal=Revista del Museo de La Plata |volume=29 |pages=35–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Sherwood Romer|Romer]], 1956 and 1966,&lt;ref name=ASR56&gt;{{cite book |last=Romer |first=Alfred S. |year=1956 |title=Osteology of the Reptiles |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-89464-985-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASR66&gt;{{cite book |last=Romer |first=Alfred S. |title= Vertebrate Paleontology |edition=Third |year=1966 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |isbn=978-0-7167-1822-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel, 1970,&lt;ref name=Steel70&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steel|first=R.|year= 1970|title=Part 14.

Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to ''Allosaurus'' included ''[[Indosaurus]]'', ''[[Piatnitzkysaurus]]'', ''[[Piveteausaurus]]'', ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]'',&lt;ref name=DL83&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |coauthors=and the Diagram Group |title=A Field Guide to Dinosaurs |year=1983 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-83519-5 |chapter=Allosaurids |pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'', ''[[Chilantaisaurus]]'', ''[[Compsosuchus]]'', ''[[Stokesosaurus]]'', and ''[[Szechuanosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=DL90&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |coauthors=and the Diagram Group |title=The Dinosaur Data Book |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-75896-3 |chapter=Allosaurids |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of [[evolution]]ary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like ''Acrocanthosaurus'' and ''Yangchuanosaurus'', are members of closely related families.&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt;

Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are [[Neovenatoridae]],&lt;ref name=bensonetal2010&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/s00114-009-0614-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carcharodontosauridae]] and [[Sinraptoridae]].&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the [[Tyrannosauridae]] (which would make it [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]]), one recent example being Gregory S.

==Discovery and history==
===Early discoveries and research===
The discovery and early study of ''Allosaurus'' is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the [[Bone Wars]] of the late 19th century. The first described [[fossil]] in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by [[Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden]] in 1869. It came from [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park]], near [[Granby, Colorado]], probably from [[Morrison Formation]] rocks. The locals had identified such bones as &quot;petrified [[horse]] hoofs&quot;. Hayden sent his specimen to [[Joseph Leidy]], who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus ''[[Poekilopleuron]]'' as ''Poicilopleuron'' [sic] ''valens''.&lt;ref name=JL70&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leidy |first=Joseph |year=1870 |title=Remarks on ''Poicilopleuron valens'', ''Clidastes intermedius'', ''Leiodon proriger'', ''Baptemys wyomingensis'', and ''Emys stevensonianus'' |journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia |volume=22 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later decided it deserved its own genus, ''Antrodemus''.&lt;ref name=JL73&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leidy |first=Joseph |year=1873 |title=Contribution to the extinct vertebrate fauna of the western territories |journal=Report of the U.S. Geological Survey of the Territories I |pages=14–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allosaurus4.jpg|thumb|left|AMNH 5753 in a [[Charles R. Knight]] life restoration.]]
''Allosaurus'' itself is [[holotype|based on]] [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]] 1930, a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and, most useful for later discussions, the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name ''Allosaurus fragilis'' in 1877. ''Allosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''allos/αλλος'', meaning &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;different&quot; and ''sauros/σαυρος'', meaning &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liddell &amp; Scott|year=1980|title=Greek–English Lexicon, Abridged Edition |publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-910207-5|oclc=17396377 187441362 213803616 217157617 225305941 237142939 43379590 78588771}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery.&lt;ref name=OCM77&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1877 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles from the Jurassic formation |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=14 |pages=514–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMLomnipedia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |title=Dinosauria Translation and Pronunciation Guide A |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Creisler, Ben |date=2003-07-07 |publisher=Dinosauria On-Line| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mpuZDuPf | archivedate = 2010-01-16| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species epithet ''fragilis'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;fragile&quot;, referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of [[Garden Park, Colorado|Garden Park]], north of [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]].&lt;ref name=OCM77/&gt; Marsh and [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who were in scientific competition, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of ''Allosaurus''. These include Marsh's ''Creosaurus''&lt;ref name=OCM78/&gt; and ''Labrosaurus'',&lt;ref name=OCM79&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1879 |title=Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs. Part II |journal=American Journal of Science, Series 3 |volume=17 |pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cope's ''Epanterias''.&lt;ref name=EDC78&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cope |first=Edward Drinker |year=1878 |title=A new opisthocoelous dinosaur |journal=American Naturalist |volume=12 |issue=6 |page=406 |doi=10.1086/272127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by [[Benjamin Franklin Mudge|Benjamin Mudge]] of the type specimen of ''Allosaurus'' in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in [[Wyoming]]; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete ''Allosaurus'' and several partial skeletons.&lt;ref name=DBN85/&gt; In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the [[Como Bluff]] area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view.&lt;ref name=NGD95&gt;{{cite book |last=Norell |first=Mark A. |coauthors=Gaffney, Eric S.; and Dingus, Lowell |title=Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=112–113 |isbn=978-0-679-43386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the well-known mount poised over a partial ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' skeleton as if [[scavenger|scavenging]] it, illustrated as such by Charles R.

Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.&lt;ref name=BBetal99&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breithaupt |first=Brent H. |year=1999 |title=AMNH 5753: The world's first free-standing theropod skeleton |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=19 |issue=3, Suppl. |page=33A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Allosaurus fragilis USNM4734.jpg|thumb|Mounted ''A. fragilis'' skeleton (USNM4734) at the [[National Museum of Natural History]]]]
The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as [[Samuel Wendell Williston]] suggested that too many names had been coined.&lt;ref name=SWW78&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williston |first=Samuel Wendell |year=1878 |title=American Jurassic dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |volume=6 |pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish ''Allosaurus'' from ''Creosaurus''.&lt;ref name=SWW01&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williston |first=Samuel Wendell |year=1901 |title=The dinosaurian genus ''Creosaurus'', Marsh |journal=American Journal of Science, series 4 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by [[Charles W. Gilmore]] in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra dubbed ''Antrodemus'' by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of ''Allosaurus'', and ''Antrodemus'' thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority.&lt;ref name=CWG20/&gt; ''Antrodemus'' became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that ''Allosaurus'' should be used because ''Antrodemus'' was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the [[geological formation]] that the single bone of ''Antrodemus'' came from is unknown).&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; &quot;''Antrodemus''&quot; has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.&lt;ref name=DH98&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=Donald M. |year=1998 |title=Skull and tooth morphology as indicators of niche partitioning in sympatric Morrison Formation theropods |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=219–266 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/16.pdf |issn=0871-5424 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries===
Although sporadic work at what became known as the [[Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Emery County, Utah|Emery County]], [[Utah]] had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by William J. Stokes in 1945,&lt;ref name=WJS45&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stokes |first=William J. |year=1945 |title=A new quarry for Jurassic dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=101 |issue=2614 |pages=115–117 |doi=10.1126/science.101.2614.115-a |pmid=17799203}}&lt;/ref&gt; major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40&amp;nbsp;institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; The quarry is notable for the predominance of ''Allosaurus'' remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod ''Allosaurus fragilis'' (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46&amp;nbsp;''A. fragilis'' have been found there, out of at minimum 73&amp;nbsp;dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the [[taphonomy]] of the site, coming up with numerous contradictory explanations for how it formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to [[drought]]-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep.&lt;ref name=APHetal06&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Adrian P |coauthors=Lucas, Spencer G.; Krainer, Karl; and Spielmann, Justin |year=2006 |chapter=The taphonomy of the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, Utah: a re-evaluation |editor=Foster, John R.; and Lucas, Spencer G.

One of the more significant ''Allosaurus'' finds was the 1991 discovery of &quot;Big Al&quot; ([[Museum of the Rockies|MOR]] 693), a 95%&amp;nbsp;complete, partially articulated specimen that measured about 8&amp;nbsp;meters (about 26&amp;nbsp;ft) in length. MOR 693 was excavated near [[Shell, Wyoming]], by a joint Museum of the Rockies and [[University of Wyoming]] Geological Museum team.&lt;ref name=BBbigal&gt;{{cite web |last=Breithaupt |first=Brent H. |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/geology/paleontology/pub/fossil_conference_6/breithaupt.htm |title=The case of &quot;Big Al&quot; the ''Allosaurus'': a study in paleodetective partnerships |accessdate=2007-10-03| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mpuZrJjN | archivedate = 2010-01-16| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This skeleton was discovered by a Swiss team, led by Kirby Siber.

==Species and taxonomy==
{{main|Species of Allosaurus}}
It is unclear how many species of ''Allosaurus'' there were. Seven species have been considered potentially valid since 1988 (''A. amplexus'',&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; ''A. atrox'',&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; ''A. europaeus'',&lt;ref name=OMetal06/&gt; the [[type species]] ''A. fragilis'',&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; the as-yet not formally described &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot;,&lt;ref name=DJC00/&gt; ''A. maximus'',&lt;ref name=DKS98/&gt; and ''A. tendagurensis''&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt;), although only a fraction are usually considered valid at any given time. Additionally, there are at least ten dubious or undescribed species that have been assigned to ''Allosaurus'' over the years, along with the species belonging to genera now sunk into ''Allosaurus''. In the most recent review of basal [[tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods, only ''A. fragilis'' (including ''A. amplexus'' and ''A. atrox'' as synonyms), &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; (as an unnamed species), and ''A. tendagurensis'' were accepted as potentially valid species, with ''A. europaeus'' not yet proposed and ''A. maximus'' assigned to ''Saurophaganax''.&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt;

The issue of synonyms is complicated by the [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] of ''Allosaurus fragilis'' (catalog number [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]]&amp;nbsp;1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious, and thus the genus ''Allosaurus'' itself or at least the species ''A. fragilis'' would be a ''nomen dubium'' (&quot;dubious name&quot;, based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). To address this situation, [[Gregory S. Paul]] and [[Kenneth Carpenter]] (2010) submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] to have the name ''A. fragilis'' officially transferred to a more complete specimen (as a [[Hapantotype|neotype]]).

==Paleobiology==
===Life history===
The wealth of ''Allosaurus'' fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as [[egg (biology)|eggs]]—crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of ''Allosaurus''.&lt;ref name=DFG97/&gt; Based on [[Histology|histological]] analysis of limb bones, the upper age limit for ''Allosaurus'' is estimated at 22 to 28&amp;nbsp;years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age&amp;nbsp;15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150&amp;nbsp;kilograms (330&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) per year.&lt;ref name=PBetal06/&gt;

Medullary bone tissue, also found in dinosaurs as diverse as ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', has been found in at least one ''Allosaurus'' specimen, a [[tibia|shin bone]] from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply [[calcium]] to shells. Its presence in the ''Allosaurus'' individual establishes sex and shows she had reached reproductive age. By counting growth lines, it was shown that she was 10&amp;nbsp;years old at death, so sexual maturity in ''Allosaurus'' was attained well before maximum growth and size.&lt;ref name=LW08&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Andrew H. |year=2008 |title=Sexual maturity in growing dinosaurs does not fit reptilian growth models |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=582–587 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708903105 |pmid=18195356 |last2=Werning |first2=S |pmc=2206579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Allosaurus juvenile skeleton.JPG|thumb|Mounted cast of a juvenile specimen, ''A.'' &quot;jimmadseni&quot;, [[North American Museum of Ancient Life]]]]

The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger ''Allosaurus'' were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood.&lt;ref name=FC06/&gt; The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression.&lt;ref name=LCS02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loewen |first=Mark A. |year=2002 |title=Ontogenetic changes in hindlimb musculature and function in the Late Jurassic theropod ''Allosaurus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3, Suppl. |page=80A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown [[allometry|isometrically]], increasing in size without changing in proportion.&lt;ref name=KC2010/&gt;

===Feeding===
[[File:DMSN dinosaurs.jpg|thumb|left|''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus'' skeletons, [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]]]]
Paleontologists accept ''Allosaurus'' as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on ''Stegosaurus'', including an ''Allosaurus'' tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a ''Stegosaurus'' [[thagomizer|tail spike]], and a ''Stegosaurus'' neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an ''Allosaurus'' snout.&lt;ref name=KSMW05&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Carpenter |coauthors=Sanders, Frank; McWhinney, Lorrie A.; and Wood, Lowell |title=The Carnivorous Dinosaurs|year=2005 |chapter=Evidence for predator-prey relationships: Examples for ''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus'' |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth (ed.)|pages=325–350 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |isbn= 978-0-253-34539-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sauropod]]s seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of [[scavenging]], based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones.&lt;ref name=FS04&gt;Fastovsky, David E.; and Smith, Joshua B. (2004). &quot;Dinosaur Paleoecology&quot;, in ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd). 614–626.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, ''Allosaurus'' was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods.&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults.&lt;ref name=JF07/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG93/&gt; Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. [[Robert T. Bakker]], comparing ''Allosaurus'' to [[Cenozoic]] sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although ''Allosaurus'' did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a [[saw]]-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.&lt;ref name=BB98/&gt;
[[File:Allosaurus Jaws Steveoc86.jpg|thumb|''Allosaurus'' attacking, based on the theories of [[Robert T. Bakker|Bakker]] (1998) and [[Emily Rayfield|Rayfield]] ''et al.'' (2001).]]
Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using [[finite element analysis]] on an ''Allosaurus'' skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]], less than the values for [[alligator]]s (13,000&amp;nbsp;N), [[lion]]s (4,167&amp;nbsp;N), and [[leopard]]s (2,268&amp;nbsp;N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500&amp;nbsp;N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that ''Allosaurus'' used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike ''Tyrannosaurus'', which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods.&lt;ref name=ERetal01/&gt; Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey.&lt;ref name=FK02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frazzetta |first=T.H. |year=2002 |title=Prey attack by a large theropod dinosaur |journal=Nature |volume=416 |pages=387–388 |doi=10.1038/416387a |pmid=11919619 |last2=Kardong |first2=KV |issue=6879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original authors noted that ''Allosaurus'' itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the [[palate]] and lessen stress.&lt;ref name=ERetal02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rayfield |first=Emily J. |year=2002 |title=Prey attack by a large theropod dinosaur: Response to Frazzetta and Kardong, 2002 |journal=Nature |volume=416 |page=388 |doi=10.1038/416388a |last2=Norman |first2=D. B. |last3=Upchurch |first3=P. |issue=6879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like ''Allosaurus'' were &quot;flesh grazers&quot; which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later.&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea.&lt;ref name=JF07/&gt; This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey.&lt;ref name=KC02/&gt;
[[File:Allosaurus skull front.jpg|thumb|upright|''Allosaurus'' skull cast in front view at the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin]]
Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of ''Allosaurus'' limited potential [[binocular vision]] to 20° of width, slightly less than that of modern [[crocodilia]]ns. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks.&lt;ref name=KAS06&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=Kent A. |year=2006 |title=Binocular vision in theropod dinosaurs |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=321–330 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[321:BVITD]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close,&lt;ref name=KC02/&gt; and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things.&lt;ref name=CWG20/&gt; Finally, the top speed of ''Allosaurus'' has been estimated at 30 to 55&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (19 to 34&amp;nbsp;miles per hour).&lt;ref name=PC98&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christiansen |first=Per |year=1998 |title=Strength indicator values of theropod long bones, with comments on limb proportions and cursorial potential |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |issue= |pages=241–255 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/19.pdf |issn=0871-5424 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social behavior===
It has been speculated since the 1970s that ''Allosaurus'' preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups.&lt;ref name=JF76&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farlow |first=James O. |year=1976 |title=Speculations about the diet and foraging behavior of large carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=186–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature.&lt;ref name=DBN85/&gt;&lt;ref name=DL83/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG93/&gt; Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to [[lair]]s for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food.&lt;ref name=RTB97/&gt; However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods,&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia&lt;ref name=DJC00b/&gt; and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named ''Labrosaurus ferox'' is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a [[pack hunter|pack]] or to settle [[territory (animal)|territorial]] disputes.&lt;ref name=TC98&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tanke |first=Darren H. |authorlink=Darren Tanke |year=1998 |title=Head-biting behavior in theropod dinosaurs: Paleopathological evidence |journal=Gaia |issue=15 |pages=167–184 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/12.pdf |issn=0871-5424 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Allosaurus'' may have hunted in packs,&lt;ref name=completedino&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Dinosaur |url=http://books.google.com/?id=FOViD-lDPy0C&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Allosaurus+behavior |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |chapter=Theropods |editor=Farlow, James; and Brett-Surman, M.K. (eds.) |year=1999 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |page=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that ''Allosaurus'' and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among [[vertebrate]]s in general, and modern [[diapsid]] carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) very rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple ''Allosaurus'' individuals at the same site, e.g. in the Cleveland–Lloyd quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that ''Allosaurus'' individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like [[crocodile]]s and [[Komodo dragon]]s. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites.&lt;ref name=RB07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roach|first=Brian T. |year=2007 |title=A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs|journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–138 |doi=10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2|last2=Brinkman|first2=Daniel L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for cannibalism in ''Allosaurus'', including ''Allosaurus'' shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a [[scapula|shoulder blade]],&lt;ref name=BGD04&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodchild Drake |first=Brandon |year=2004 |title=A new specimen of ''Allosaurus'' from north-central Wyoming |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=24 |issue=3, Suppl. |page=65A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.&lt;ref name=BB04/&gt;

===Brain and senses===
The brain of ''Allosaurus'', as interpreted from spiral [[computed tomography|CT scanning]] of an [[endocranial cast|endocast]], was more consistent with [[crocodilia]]n brains than those of the other living [[archosaur]]s, birds. The structure of the [[vestibular system|vestibular apparatus]] indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the [[inner ear]] was like that of a crocodilian, and so ''Allosaurus'' probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The [[olfactory bulb]]s were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.&lt;ref name=SWR99/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Allosaurus in Baltow 20060916 1500.jpg|thumb|right|''Allosaurus'' model in [[Bałtów, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship|Bałtów]], [[Poland]].]]
Along with ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''Allosaurus'' has come to represent the quintessential large, carnivorous dinosaur in popular culture. It is a common dinosaur in museums, due in particular to the excavations at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry; by 1976, as a result of cooperative operations, 38&amp;nbsp;museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; ''Allosaurus'' is the official [[state fossil]] of [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=statefossil&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/fossil.html |title=Utah Symbols&amp;nbsp;– State Fossil |accessdate=2010-06-16|publisher=Pioneer: Utah's Online Library, State of Utah | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mpuZdNJC | archivedate = 2010-01-16| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Allosaurus'' has been depicted in popular culture since the early years of the 20th century. It is top predator in both [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 novel, ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', and its [[The Lost World (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]], the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;Glut, Donald F.; Brett-Surman, Michael K. (1997). &quot;Dinosaurs and the media&quot;, in Farlow, James; and Brett-Surman, Michael K. (eds.): The Complete Dinosaur. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 675–706. ISBN 978-0-253-33349-0.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film ''[[The Beast of Hollow Mountain]]'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lambert, ''Dinosaur Data Book'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1969 film ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'', two [[genre]] combinations of living dinosaurs with [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. In ''The Valley of Gwangi'', Gwangi is billed as an ''Allosaurus'', although [[Ray Harryhausen]] based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight's depiction of a ''Tyrannosaurus''. Harryhausen sometimes confuses the two, stating in a DVD interview &quot;They're both meat eaters, they're both tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Return to the Valley'', a documentary on the Region 1 ''Valley of Gwangi'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' appeared in the second episode of the 1999 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' and the follow-up special ''[[The Ballad of Big Al]]'', which speculated on the life of the &quot;Big Al&quot; specimen, based on scientific evidence from the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton.&lt;ref name=benton2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benton | first1 = M.J. | year = 2001 | title = The science of 'Walking with Dinosaurs'&quot;. | url = | journal = Teaching Earth Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 371–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AK-47''' is a [[selective fire|selective-fire]], [[gas operated|gas-operated]] [[7.62×39mm]] [[assault rifle]], first developed in the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]]. It is officially known as ''Avtomat Kalashnikova.'' It is also known as a '''Kalashnikov''', an &quot;AK&quot;, or, in [[Russian language|Russian]] slang, '''Kalash'''.

Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of [[World War II]] (1945). After the war in 1946, the AK-46 was presented for official military trials. In 1947 the fixed-stock version was introduced into service with select units of the [[Soviet Army]]. An early development of the design was the '''AKS-47''' (S—''Skladnoy'' or &quot;folding&quot;), which was equipped with an underfolding metal [[stock (firearm)|shoulder stock]]. In 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and used by the majority of the member states of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

The original AK-47 was one of the first true &quot;assault rifles&quot; to be manufactured, after the original [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]].&lt;ref name=&quot;poyer&quot;&gt;Poyer, Joe. ''The AK-47 and AK-74 Kalashnikov Rifles and Their Variations''. North Cape Publications. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weaponomics&quot; /&gt; Even after six decades the model and its variants remain the most widely used and popular assault rifles in the world because of its durability, low production cost, and ease of use. It has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as revolutionary and terrorist organizations worldwide. The AK-47 was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. More AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldbank.org&quot;&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/04/13/000016406_20070413145045/Rendered/PDF/wps4202.pdf Worldbank.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Design background===
During [[World War II]], the [[Germans]] first pioneered the [[assault rifle]] concept, based upon research that showed that most firefights happen at close range, within approximately 300&amp;nbsp;meters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The power and range of contemporary rifle cartridges was excessive for most small arms firefights. As a result, armies sought a cartridge and rifle combining [[submachine gun]] features (large-capacity magazine, selective-fire) with an intermediate-power cartridge effective to 300&amp;nbsp;meters. To reduce manufacturing costs, the [[7.92x57mm Mauser]] cartridge case was shortened, the result of which was the lighter [[7.92x33mm Kurz]].

The resultant rifle was the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] (StG44). An earlier firearm, the Italian [[Cei-Rigotti]] combined similar features but suffered poor reliability and ejection mechanism, as well as inferior magazine capacity. Towards the end of the war, the Germans fielded the StG44 against the Soviets; the experience deeply influenced Soviet military doctrine in the post-war years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

[[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] began his career as a weapon designer while in a hospital after he was shot in the shoulder during the [[Battle of Bryansk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,288456,00.html |title=AK-47 Inventor Doesn't Lose Sleep Over Havoc Wrought With His Invention |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2007-07-06 |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After tinkering with a sub-machine gun design, he entered a competition for a new weapon that would chamber the 7.62x41mm cartridge developed by Elisarov and Semin in 1943 (the 7.62x41mm cartridge predated the current [[7.62x39mm|7.62x39mm M1943]]). A particular requirement of the competition was the reliability of the firearm in the muddy, wet, and frozen conditions of the Soviet front line. Kalashnikov designed a carbine, strongly influenced by the American [[M1 Garand]], that lost out to the Simonov design that later became the [[SKS]] semi-automatic carbine. At the same time, the Soviet Army was interested in developing a true assault rifle employing a shortened M1943 round. The first such weapon was presented by [[Aleksei Sudaev|Sudayev]] in 1944, but trials found it to be too heavy.&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, D.N, &quot;Soviet Small-Arms and Ammunition&quot;, pp 68.&lt;/ref&gt; A new design competition was held two years later where Kalashnikov and his design team submitted an entry. It was a gas-operated rifle which had a breech-block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine, and a curved 30-round magazine.

Kalashnikov's rifles (codenamed AK-1 and −2) proved to be reliable and the weapon was accepted to second round of competition along with designs by A.A Demetev and F. Bulkin. In late 1946, as the rifles were being tested, one of Kalashnikov's assistants, Aleksandr Zaytsev, suggested a major redesign of AK-1, particularly to improve reliability. At first, Kalashnikov was reluctant, given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors. Eventually, however, Zaytsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov. The new rifle was produced for a second round of firing tests and field trials. There, Kalashnikov assault rifle model 1947 proved to be simple and reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics. In 1949 it was therefore adopted by the Soviet Army as '7.62mm Kalashnikov assault rifle (AK)'.&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, pp 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design concept===
The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations: the trigger, double locking lugs and unlocking raceway of the [[M1 Garand rifle|M1 Garand]]/[[M1 carbine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|url=http://www.ak-47.net/ak47/galil.html |title=IMI Galil |publisher=AK-47.net|author=J.F.S. |month=July |year=1983 |journal=Soldier of Fortune |accessdate=2008-10-19|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080323110816/http%3A//www.ak-47.net/ak47/galil.html |archivedate = March 23, 2008|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; the safety mechanism of the [[John Browning]] designed [[Remington Model 8]] rifle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remington.com/library/history/firearm_models/centerfire/model_8.asp |title=Firearm Model History – Remington Model 8 |publisher=Remington.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-19|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615193132/http%3A//www.remington.com/library/history/firearm_models/centerfire/model_8.asp |archivedate = June 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gas system and layout of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]].

These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, pp 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AK-47 type II Part DM-ST-89-01131.jpg|thumb|A Type 2 AK-47, the first machined receiver variation]]

There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal [[receiver (firearms)|receivers]]. Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poyer_9&quot;&gt;Poyer, 9&lt;/ref&gt; This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin-Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim [[SKS]] rifle continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poyer_9&quot; /&gt;

Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the [[AKM]] (M for &quot;modernized&quot; or &quot;upgraded&quot;—in Russian: (''Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный [Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy]'') was introduced in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ezell_36&quot;&gt;Ezell, 36&lt;/ref&gt; This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted [[muzzle brake]] on the end of the [[gun barrel|barrel]] to compensate for [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] rise under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed), during rapid or automatic fire.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer, 11&lt;/ref&gt; This is also sometimes referred to as a &quot;cyclic rate reducer&quot;, or simply &quot;rate reducer&quot;, as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during automatic fire. It was also roughly one-third lighter than the previous model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ezell_36&quot; /&gt; Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM variant, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poyer_2&quot;&gt;Poyer, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the &quot;Kalashnikov&quot; or &quot;AK&quot;. The photo above at right illustrates the differences between the Type 2 milled receiver and the Type 4 stamped, including the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine.

In 1978, the Soviet Union began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]]. This new rifle and cartridge had only started being exported to eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed, drastically slowing production of this and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc.

The main advantages of the Kalashnikov rifle are its simple design, fairly compact size and adaptation to [[mass production]]. It is inexpensive to manufacture, and easy to clean and maintain. Its ruggedness and reliability are legendary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030423.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070325171640/http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030423.asp |archivedate=2007-03-25 |title=An AK for Every Market by James Dunnigan April 23, 2003 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.reuters.com/oddly-enough/2007/06/14/mimes-fighting-to-be-heard/ | title=Soldiers from special force unit &quot;COE&quot; take part in a military training exercise at the military base, near Managua | first=Oswaldo | last=Rivas | publisher=Reuters | published=2007-06-13 | accessdate=2008-12-09 | date=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AK-47 was initially designed for ease of operation and repair by glove-wearing Soviet soldiers in Arctic conditions. The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy, as the looser tolerances do not allow for precision and consistency. Reflecting Soviet infantry doctrine of its time, the rifle is meant to be part of massed infantry fire, not long range engagements. The average service life of an AK-47 is 20 to 40 years depending on the conditions to which it has been exposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;weaponomics&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Weaponomics: The Economics of Small Arms | url = http://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/workingpapers/pdfs/2006-13text.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notched rear tangent [[iron sight]] is adjustable, and is calibrated in hundreds of meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. [[Windage]] adjustment is done by the armory before issue. The battle setting places the round within a few centimeters above or below the point of aim out to about 250&amp;nbsp;meters (275&amp;nbsp;yd). This &quot;[[point-blank range]]&quot; setting allows the shooter to fire the gun at any close target without adjusting the sights. The field adjustment procedure for AK-47, AKM and AK-74 family requires 4 rounds to be placed in a 15&amp;nbsp;cm group at a distance of 100&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;AKM handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Handbook for firearms use and maintenance: Kalashnikov 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm modernized assault rifle (AKM and AKMS).

These settings mirror the [[Mosin-Nagant]] and [[SKS]] rifles which the AK-47 replaced. This eased transition and simplified training.

The prototype of the AK-47, the AK-46, had a separate fire selector and safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;popeneker&quot;&gt;Popeneker, Maxim and Williams, Anthony. ''Assault Rifle'' The Crowood Press Ltd. (2005) ISBN 978-1-86126-700-9.&lt;/ref&gt; These were later combined in the production version to simplify the design. The fire selector acts as a dust cover for the charging handle raceway when placed on safe. This prevents intrusion of dust and other debris into the internal parts. The dust cover on the M16 rifle, in contrast, is not tied to the safety, and has to be manually closed. Soviet army handbooks for AKM and AK-74 do not cover target engagement using the semi-automatic setting, and advise the use of short and long bursts (but still recommend short ones).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title = Handbook for firearms use and maintenance: Kalashnikov 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm modernized assault rifle (AKM and AKMS). USSR Ministry of Defence, revised, 1983. In Russian; e-book | url = http://talks.guns.ru/forummessage/18/502015.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-74 handbook&quot;/&gt;

The [[caliber|bore]] and [[chamber (weaponry)|chamber]], as well as the gas piston and the interior of the [[pneumatic cylinder|gas cylinder]], are generally [[chromium]]-plated. This plating dramatically increases the life of these parts by resisting corrosion and wear. This is particularly important, as most military-production ammunition (and virtually all ammunition produced by the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations) during the 20th century contained [[potassium chlorate]] in the [[Percussion cap|primers]]. On firing, this was converted to corrosive and hygroscopic [[potassium chloride]] which mandated frequent and thorough cleaning in order to prevent damage. [[Chrome plating]] of critical parts is now common on many modern military weapons.

The construction of the AK magazine is very robust with reinforced feed lips that contribute to the reliable functioning for which the design is noted. Most Yugoslavian and some East German AK magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty; however, most AK magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty.

===Operating cycle===
[[File:Izhmash AK 47 schematic.JPG|thumb|The gas-operated mechanism of an AK-47 (Chinese version)]]
To fire, the operator inserts a loaded [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]], moves the selector lever off of safety, pulls back and releases the [[Cocking handle|charging handle]], aims, and then pulls the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]]. In this setting, the firearm fires only once (semi-automatic), requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. With the selector in the middle position (full-automatic), the rifle continues to fire, automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. As each bullet travels through the barrel, a portion of the gases expanding behind it is diverted into the gas tube above the barrel, where it impacts the [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|gas piston]]. The piston, in turn, is driven backward, pushing the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] carrier, which causes the bolt to move backwards, ejecting the spent round, and chambering a new round when the recoil spring pushes it back.&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot;&gt;Department of the Army. Operators Manual for AK-47 Assault Rifle. 203d Military Intelligence Battalion&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disassembly===
Dismantling the rifle involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine. The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the weapon is unloaded. The operator presses forward on the retainer button at the rear of the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it. The operator then pushes the spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway, withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear. The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it, and then pull it away. The operator removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the bolt so the camming lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free. When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble.&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot;/&gt;

===Ballistics===
{{Main|7.62x39mm}}
The standard AK-47 or AKM fires the 7.62x39mm [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] with a muzzle [[velocity]] of {{convert|710|m/s}}. Muzzle energy is {{convert|2010|J|ftlbf}}. Projectile weight is normally {{convert|7.8|g|gr}}. The AK-47 and AKM, with the 7.62×39mm cartridge, have a maximum effective range of around {{convert|400|m}}.

==Variants==
Kalashnikov variants include:
[[File:AK 47.JPG|thumb|right|1955 AK-47 Type 3]]
* '''AK-47 1948–51, 7.62x39mm''' – The very earliest models, with the Type 1 stamped sheet metal receiver, are now very rare.

===Derivatives===
[[File:AK-47 and Type 56 DD-ST-85-01269.jpg|thumb|[[Type 56]] and AKS-47]]

The basic design of the AK-47 has been used as the basis for other successful rifle designs such as the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Rk 62|Rk 62/76]] and [[Rk 95 Tp]], the [[Israel]]i [[IMI Galil|Galil]], the Indian [[INSAS rifle|INSAS]] and the Yugoslav [[Zastava M76]] and M77/82 rifles. Several [[bullpup]] designs have surfaced such as the Chinese [[Norinco Type 86S]], although none have been produced in quantity. Bullpup conversions are also available commercially.

==Illicit trade==

Throughout the world, the AK and its variants are among the most commonly smuggled small arms sold to governments, rebels, criminals, and civilians alike, with little international oversight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In some countries, prices for AKs are very low; in [[Somalia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Mozambique]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]], prices are between $30 and $125 per weapon, and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting. [[Moisés Naím]] observed that in a small town in [[Kenya]] in 1986, an AK-47 cost fifteen cows but that in 2005, the price was down to four cows indicating that supply was &quot;immense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5279.html |title=Carnegie Council.

And you know, one man's [[terrorist]] is another man's [[freedom fighter]], so we all sort of think, oh boy, we've got a little bit of [[Che Guevara]] in us. And this accounts for the popularity of the (AK 47) weapon. Plus I think that in the United States it's considered [[counterculture]], which is always something that citizens in this country kind of like ... It's kind of sticking a finger in the eye of [[the man]], if you will.&quot;

The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as Western countries (especially the United States) supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces in a global struggle between the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations and their allies against [[NATO]] and their allies called the [[Cold War]]. While the NATO countries used rifles such as the relatively expensive [[M14 rifle|M14]], [[FN FAL]], and [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|H&amp;K G3]] [[battle rifles]] and [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle during this time, the low production and materials costs of the AK-47 meant that the Soviet Union could produce and supply its allies at a very low cost. Because of its low cost, it was also duplicated or [[List of weapons influenced by the Kalashnikov design|used as the basis]] for many other rifles, such as the [[Israel]]i [[IMI Galil|Galil]], Chinese [[Type 56 assault rifle|Type 56]], and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[SIG SG 550]]. As a result, the Cold War saw the mass export of AK-47s by the Soviet Union and the PRC to their allies, such as the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinistas]], [[Viet Cong]] as well as Middle Eastern, Asian, and African revolutionaries. The United States also purchased the Type 56 from the PRC to give to the [[mujahideen]] guerrillas during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5rar.asn.au/weapons/type_56.htm &quot;Chinese Type-56 Assault Rifle&quot; 5th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Association website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Mozambique.svg|left|thumb|[[Flag of Mozambique]] featuring the AK-47.]]

The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. The AK-47 is included in the [[flag of Mozambique]] and its [[Coat of arms of Mozambique|coat of arms]], an acknowledgment that the country's leaders gained power in large part through the effective use of their AK-47s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Gordon, &quot;Burst of Pride for a Staccato Executioner: AK-47&quot; ''The New York Times'', March 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the coat of arms of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[East Timor]], the revolution era [[coat of arms of Burkina Faso]], the [[flag of Hezbollah]], and the logo of the [[Iran]]ian [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In parts of the Western world, the AK-47 is associated with their enemies; both Cold War era and present-day. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by Western democracies, including Middle Eastern nations such as [[Syria]], [[Libya]] and [[Iran]], who welcomed Soviet Union backing against [[Israel]]. After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]], AK-47s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash, including drug cartels and dictatorial states, and more recently they have been seen in the hands of violent Islamic terrorist groups such as the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], and [[FARC]], [[Ejército de Liberación Nacional]] guerrillas in Colombia. Western movies often portray criminals, gang members and terrorists using AK-47s. For these reasons, in the U.S. and Western Europe the AK-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents, gangsters and terrorists. Conversely, throughout the [[developing world]], the AK-47 can be positively attributed with [[revolutionaries]] or &quot;freedom fighters&quot; from foreign occupation, [[imperialism]], or [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NPRKahaner&quot; /&gt;

In [[Mexico]], the AK-47 is known as &quot;Cuerno de Chivo&quot; (literally &quot;Ram's Horn&quot;) and is one of the weapons of choice of Mexican drug cartels. It is sometimes mentioned in Mexican folk music lyrics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 2006, [[Colombia]]n musician and peace activist [[Cesar Lopez|César López]] devised the ''[[escopetarra]]'', an AK converted into a guitar. One sold for US$17,000 in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of [[anti-personnel mines]], while another was exhibited at the [[United Nations]]' [[Conference on Disarmament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | title = Escopetarras: disparando música | last = Latorre | first = Héctor | date = 2006-01-24 | accessdate = 2007-01-31 | publisher = BBC World | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_4644000/4644028.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalashnikov Museum==
The Kalashnikov Museum (also called the AK-47 museum) opened on November 4, 2004, in [[Izhevsk]], a city in the [[Ural Mountains]] of Russia. The museum chronicles the biography of General [[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]], as well as documents the invention of the AK-47. The museum complex of small arms of M. T. Kalashnikov, a series of halls and multimedia exhibitions is devoted to the evolution of the AK-47 assault rifle and attracts 10,000 monthly visitors. The museum serves as Russia's monument to this world-renowned infantry weapon. &lt;ref&gt;Chivers, C.J. http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/travel/18heads.html The New York Times 2007-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadezhda Vechtomova, the museum director stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to &quot;separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country.&quot;

The '''Atanasoff–Berry Computer''' ('''ABC''') was the first [[electronics|electronic]] [[digital]] [[computing]] device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 1976 | editor-last = Ralston | editor-first = Anthony | editor2-last = Meek | editor2-first = Christopher | title = Encyclopedia of Computer Science | edition = second | pages = 488–489 | isbn = 0-88405-321-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conceived in 1937, the machine was not programmable, being designed only to solve systems of [[linear equation]]s.  It was successfully tested in 1942. However, its intermediate result storage mechanism, a paper card writer/reader, was unreliable, and when inventor [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] left [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] for World War II assignments, work on the machine was discontinued.&lt;ref name = Copeland2006&gt;{{Citation | last = Copeland | first = Jack  | year = 2006 | title = Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers | publication-place = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 101–115 | isbn = 0-19-284055-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ABC pioneered important elements of modern computing, including [[binary arithmetic]] and [[Electronics|electronic switching]] elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Campbell-Kelly | first = Martin | last2 = Aspray | first2 = William | year =1996 | title = [[Computer: A History of the Information Machine]] | page = 84 | isbn = 0-465-02989-2 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | location = New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; but its special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, [[stored program]] distinguish it from modern computers.

Atanasoff and [[Clifford Berry]]'s computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1960s, amidst conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer.  At that time, the [[ENIAC]] was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense, but in 1973 a U.S. District Court invalidated the ENIAC patent and concluded that the ENIAC inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from Atanasoff (see [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer#Patent dispute|Patent dispute]]).

==Design and construction==

[[Image:ABC.GIF.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of the ABC pointing out its various components]]

According to Atanasoff's account, several key principles of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) were conceived in a sudden insight after a long nighttime drive during the winter of 1937–38.  The ABC innovations included electronic computation, binary arithmetic, [[parallel processing]], [[regenerative capacitor memory]], and a separation of memory and computing functions.  The mechanical and logic design was worked out by Dr. Atanasoff over the next year.  A grant application to build a [[proof of concept]] prototype was submitted in March, 1939 to the [[Agronomy]] department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis.  $5,000 of further funding to complete the machine came from the nonprofit [[Research Corporation]] of [[New York City]].

The ABC was built by Dr. Atanasoff and graduate student [[Clifford Berry]] in the basement of the physics building at [[Iowa State College]] during 1939–42. The initial funds were released in September, and the 11-tube prototype was first demonstrated in October, 1939. A December  demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full-scale machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mollenhoff | first = Clark R. | year =1988 | title = Atanasoff: Forgotten Father of the Computer | pages =47, 48 | isbn = 0-8138-0032-3 | publisher = Iowa State University Press | location = Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABC was built and tested over the next two years.  A January 15, 1941 story in the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' announced the ABC as &quot;an electrical computing machine&quot; with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would &quot;compute complicated algebraic equations&quot; (but gave no precise technical description of the computer).  The system weighed more than seven hundred pounds (320&amp;nbsp;kg).and was {{convert|800|sqft|m2}} in all. It contained approximately 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) of wire, 280 dual-triode [[vacuum tube]]s, 31 [[thyratron]]s, and was about the size of a desk.

It was not a [[Turing complete]] computer, which distinguishes it from more general machines, like contemporary  [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941), or later machines like the 1946 [[ENIAC]], 1949 [[EDVAC]], the [[University of Manchester School of Computer Science|University of Manchester]] designs, or [[Alan Turing]]'s post-War designs at [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] and elsewhere.  Nor did it implement the [[stored program architecture]] that made practical fully general-purpose, reprogrammable computers.

The machine was, however, the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer: 
#Using [[binary numeral system|binary]] digits to represent all numbers and data
#Performing all calculations using [[electronics]] rather than wheels, ratchets, or mechanical switches
#Organizing a system in which [[computation]] and [[computer storage|memory]] are separated.

In addition, the system pioneered the use of [[regenerative capacitor memory]], as in the [[DRAM]] still widely used today.

The memory of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was a pair of drums, each containing 1600 [[capacitor]]s that rotated on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 &quot;bands&quot; of 50 (30 active bands and 2 spares in case a capacitor failed), giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second. Data was represented as 50-bit binary fixed point numbers. The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time (3000 bits). 

The [[alternating current|AC]] power line frequency of 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations.
 
The [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic logic functions]] were fully electronic, implemented with vacuum tubes. The family of [[logic gates]] ranged from inverters to two and three input gates. The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates. Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier, preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function. The control logic functions, which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed, were electromechanical, implemented with [[relay]]s.

Although the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines, it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem. An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions, much like the electro-mechanical calculators and [[unit record equipment]] of the time. Selection of the operation to be performed, reading, writing, converting to or from binary to decimal, or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers.

There were two forms of input and output: primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input. The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory. (The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two simultaneous equations, a trivial problem.)

Intermediate results were binary, written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50 bit numbers (one equation). Each sheet could be written or read in one second. The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units, primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets' material characteristics. In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written. This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work. 

Primary user input was decimal, via standard [[IBM]] 80 column [[punched card]]s and output was decimal, via a front panel display.

==Comparison with other early computers==
{{Early computer characteristics}}

==Function==
The ABC was designed for a specific purpose, the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations. It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations, a difficult problem for the time. Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics, the department in which John Atanasoff worked.  The machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty-nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables.  This process would be repeated manually for each of the equations, which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable.  Then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable.

==Patent dispute==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer]] --&gt;
[[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]] were the first to patent a digital computing device, the [[ENIAC]].  The ABC had been examined by John Mauchly in June 1941, and Isaac Auerbach,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/display.phtml?id=160 Oral history interview with Isaac Levin Auerbach], [[Charles Babbage Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; a former student of Mauchly's, alleged that it influenced his later work on ENIAC, although Mauchly denied this (Shurkin, pg. 280-299). In 1967 [[Honeywell]] sued Sperry Rand in an attempt to break their ENIAC patents, arguing the ABC constituted [[prior art]]. The [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]] released its judgement on October 19, 1973, finding in ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]'' that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoff's invention. The decision was not appealed.

Atanasoff, however, never considered himself to be the originator of the idea of a general purpose computer until years after the ENIAC was revealed.  In 1954 a patent attorney from [[IBM]] approached Atanasoff asking for his help in breaking the Mauchly patent.  In a 1982 interview with Shurkin, Atanasoff said &quot;That was the first shock I had.  First time.  Nobody had compared the two of us.&quot;

Campbell-Kelly and Aspray conclude:
{{Quote|The extent to which Mauchly drew on Atanasoff's ideas remains unknown, and the evidence is massive and conflicting.  The ABC was quite modest technology, and it was not fully implemented.  At the very least we can infer that Mauchly saw the potential significance of the ABC and that this may have led him to propose a similar, electronic solution.}}

The case was legally resolved on October 19, 1973 when U.S. District Judge Earl R. Larson held the ENIAC patent invalid, ruling that the ENIAC derived many basic ideas from the Atanasoff–Berry Computer. Judge Larson explicitly stated, &quot;Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic electronic digital computer, but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff&quot;.

==Replica==
The original ABC was eventually dismantled, when the University converted the basement to classrooms, and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded. In 1997, a team of researchers led by [[John Gustafson (scientist)|John Gustafson]] from [[Ames Laboratory]] (located on the Iowa State campus) finished building a working replica of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer at a cost of $350,000. The replica ABC is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the Durham Center for Computation and Communication at Iowa State University.  It is due to be moved to be part of a major new exhibition at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]].

The '''Andes''' is the world's longest [[continental crust|continental]] [[mountain range]]. It is a continual range of highlands along the western coast of [[South America]]. This range is about {{convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide (widest between 18 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s South and 20 degrees South [[latitude]]), and of an average height of about {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Along its length, the Andes is split into several ranges, which are  separated by intermediate [[depression (geology)|depression]]s. The Andes is the location of several high plateaux – some of which host major [[city|cities]] such as [[Quito]], [[Bogotá]], [[Arequipa]], [[Medellín]], [[Sucre]], and [[La Paz]].

The so-called [[Altiplano|Altiplano plateau]] is the world's second-highest plateau following the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The Andes extends to seven countries, in alphabetical order: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]], some of which are known as the [[Andean States]].

The Andes range is the world's highest mountain range outside of the [[continent]] of [[Asia]]. The highest peak, Mt. [[Aconcagua]], rises to an elevation of about {{convert|6962|m|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. The [[Summit (topography)|peak]] of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Mt. Chimborazo]] in the Ecuadorean Andes is located at the point on the surface of the Earth that is the most distant one from its centre. This is because of the Earth's [[equatorial bulge]] that results from its  [[rotation]]. The world's highest volcanos are in the Andes, including [[Ojos del Salado]] on the Chile-Argentina frontier which rises to 6,893 m (22,615&amp;nbsp;ft), and over 50 other volcanos that rise above 6,000 m.

==Name==

The etymology of the word ''Andes'' has been debated. The major consensus is that it derives from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word ''anti'', which means &quot;high crest&quot;. Others believe that ''Andes'' comes from ''[[Anti Suyu]]'', one of the four regions of the Inca empire. It is more likely however that the word ''Antisuyo'' derives from the use of ''Anti'' to designate mountain chains. Derivation from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''andén'' (in the sense of cultivation [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]) has also been proposed, yet considered very unlikely.

==Geography==
[[Image:Aconcagua.8.22.03w.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Aconcagua.]]
The Andes can be divided into three sections: &lt;br&gt;
I. The Southern Andes in Argentina and Chile;&lt;br&gt;
II. The Central Andes, including the Chilean and Peruvian cordilleras and parts of Bolivia;&lt;br&gt;
III. The Northern Andes in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador that consists of two parallel ranges, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Oriental. In Colombia, north its the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, the western, central, and eastern ranges. (The cordillera occidental, central, and oriental).

In the northern part of the Andes, the isolated [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] range is often considered to be part of the Andes. The eastern range of Colombia is the only one that extends to Venezuela.&lt;ref name=&quot;andesmap&quot;&gt;[http://andes.zoom-maps.com/ Andes travel map]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''cordillera'' comes from the Spanish word meaning &quot;cuerda&quot;, meaning &quot;rope&quot;. The Andes range is about {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide throughout its length, except in the Bolivian flexure where it is about {{convert|640|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], which lie in the [[Caribbean Sea]] off the coast of Venezuela, were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the Andes range, but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the South-American and Caribbean plates.

==Geology==
{{Geology of the Andes}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
The Andes are a [[Mesozoic]] – [[Tertiary]] [[orogenic]] belt of mountains along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], a zone of [[volcanic activity]] that encompasses the Pacific rim of the Americas as well as the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The Andes are the result of [[plate tectonics]] processes, caused by the [[subduction]] of [[oceanic crust]] beneath the [[South American plate]]. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of western rim of the [[South American Plate]] due to the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Antarctic Plate]]. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several [[sedimentary basin]]s such as [[Orinoco]], [[Amazon Basin]], [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]] and [[Gran Chaco]] which separates the Andes from the ancient [[craton]]s in eastern South America. In the south the Andes shares a long boundary with the former [[Patagonia#Geology|Patagonia Terrane]]. To the west the Andes ends at the [[Pacific Ocean]], although the [[Peru-Chile trench]] can be considerated its ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography.

===Orogeny===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Magmaticarcandes.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Map of the [[volcanic arc]]s, flat-slab segments and [[subduction|subducted]] ridges in Andes]] --&gt;
The western rim of the [[South American Plate]] has been the place of several pre-Andean orogenies since at least the  of the late [[Proterozoic]] and early [[Paleozoic]] when several [[terrane]]s and [[microcontinent]]s collided and amalgamated with the ancient [[craton]]s of eastern South America, by then the [[South American Plate|South American part]] of [[Gondwana]].

The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the [[Triassic]] when Pangea begun to break up and several [[rift]]s developed. It continued through the [[Jurassic]] Period. It was during the [[Cretaceous]] Period that the Andes began to take its present form, by the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifting]], [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and [[erosion]].

Tectonic forces above the [[subduction zone]] along the entire west coast of South America where the [[Nazca Plate]] and a part of the [[Antarctic Plate]] are sliding beneath the [[South American Plate]] continue to produce an ongoing [[Orogeny|orogenic event]] resulting in minor to major [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s to this day. In the extreme south a major [[transform fault]] separates [[Tierra del Fuego]] from the small [[Scotia Plate]]. Across the {{convert|1000|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide [[Drake Passage]] lie the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Volcanism===
{{Main|Andean Volcanic Belt}}
[[Image:Browncanyonquilotoa.jpg|thumb|[[Rift valley]] near [[Quilotoa]], [[Ecuador]].]]
[[Image:Central Andes Mountains, Salar de Arizaro, Argentina.jpg|thumb|Astronaut photograph with the high plains of the Andes Mountains in the foreground, with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert.]]

The Andes range has many active volcanoes, which are distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity. The Andean volcanism is a result of [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] and [[Antarctic Plate]] underneath the [[South American Plate]]. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighboring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for [[calc-alkalic]] and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extrensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[seamount]] chains apart from a large range on crustal thicknesses and [[magma]] ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.

===Ore deposits and evaporites===
The Andes mountains host large ore and salt deposits and some of its eastern [[fold and thrust]] acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of [[hydrocarbons]]. In the forelands of the [[Atacama desert]] some of the largest [[porphyry copper]] mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the 1st and 2nd largest exporters of copper in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by fluids (mostly water) during the cooling of plutons.  The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of [[meteoric water]]. The dry climate in the central western Andes have also led to the creation of extensive [[saltpeter]] deposits which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the [[Dry lake|salars]] of [[Salar de Atacama|Atacama]] and [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], the first one being the largest source of lithium at present day and the second the world’s largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and Neogene plutonism in Bolivias Cordillera Central created the Bolivian tin belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of [[Cerro Rico de Potosí]].

[[Image:Volcanic Landscapes, Central Andes.JPG|thumb|Astronaut photograph of the Central Andes]]

The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on location, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of {{convert|18|C|F|0}} in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. [[Rainforest]]s exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The [[snow line]] depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800&amp;nbsp;m (14,800&amp;ndash;15,800&amp;nbsp;ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to 4,800&amp;ndash;5,200&amp;nbsp;m (15,800&amp;ndash;17,060&amp;nbsp;ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then descending to {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on Aconcagua at 32°S, {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} at 40°S, {{convert|500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} at 50°S, and only {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in [[Tierra del Fuego]] at 55°S; from 50°S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones; the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Since the Dry Andes extends from the latitudes of [[Atacama Desert]] to the area of [[Maule River]], precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the [[ablation]] area or in the [[Glacier ice accumulation|accumulation area]].

In the high Andes of central Chile and [[Mendoza Province]] [[rock glacier]]s are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Christoph Otto, Joachim Götz, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Dario Trombotto, and Lothar Schrott (2010). Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system - Morenas Coloradas valley (Cordon del Plata, Mendoza, Argentina)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
[[Rainforests]] used to encircle much of the northern Andes but are now greatly [[Deforestation|diminished]], especially in the [[El Chocó|Chocó]] and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. As a direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. Along with several [[Interandean Valles]], they are typically dominated by [[deciduous]] woodland, shrub and [[xeric]] vegetation, reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Atacama Desert.

About 30,000 species of [[vascular plants]] live in the Andes with roughly half being [[endemism|endemic]] to the region, surpassing the diversity of any other [[Biodiversity hotspot|hotspot]].&lt;ref name = &quot;biodiv&quot;/&gt; The small tree ''[[Cinchona pubescens]]'', a source of [[quinine]] which is used to treat [[malaria]], is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that originated from the Andes are [[tobacco]] and [[potatoes]]. The high-altitude ''[[Polylepis]]'' forests and woodlands are found in the Andean areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees, by locals referred to as Queñua, Yagual and other names, can be found at altitudes of {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level. It remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the [[Inca]]n period. Regardless, in [[modern history|modern times]] the clearance has accelerated, and the trees are now considered to be highly [[endangered]], with some believing that as little as 10% of the original woodland remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Fauna==

[[Image:Ausangate-hillside-MT.jpg|thumb|Herds of [[llama]]s ([[alpaca]]s) on the mountain [[Ausangate]] hillside.]]
{{Main|Fauna of the Andes}}
The Andes is rich in fauna: With almost 3,500 species, of which roughly 2/3 are [[endemism|endemic]] to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for [[amphibians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;&gt;[http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/andes/Pages/biodiversity.aspx Tropical Andes] - biodiversityhotspots.org&lt;/ref&gt;
The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of [[mammals]] (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of [[birds]] (about 1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of [[reptile]] (about 45% endemic), and almost 400 species of [[fish]] (about 1/3 endemic).&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;/&gt;

The [[Vicuña]] and [[Guanaco]] can be found living in the [[Altiplano]], while the closely related [[domesticated]] [[Llama]] and [[Alpaca]] are widely kept by locals as [[pack animal]]s and for their [[meat]] and [[wool]]. The nocturnal [[chinchilla]]s, two threatened members of the [[rodent]] order, inhabit the Andes' alpine regions. The [[Andean Condor]], the largest bird of its kind in the [[Western Hemisphere]], occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the [[Huemul (zoology)|huemul]], [[cougar]], foxes in the genus ''[[Pseudalopex]]'', and, for birds, certain species of [[tinamou]]s (notably members of the genus ''[[Nothoprocta]]''), [[Andean Goose]], [[Giant Coot]], [[flamingo]]s (mainly associated with [[hypersaline]] lakes),  [[Lesser Rhea]], [[Andean Flicker]], [[Diademed Sandpiper-plover]], [[Geositta|miners]], [[Phrygilus|sierra-finches]] and [[Diuca|diuca-finches]].

[[Lake Titicaca]] hosts several endemics, among them the highly endangered [[Titicaca Flightless Grebe]] and [[Titicaca Water Frog]]. A few species of [[hummingbirds]], notably some [[Oreotrochilus|hillstars]], can be seen at altitudes above {{convert|4000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, but far higher [[Species richness|diversities]] can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests (&quot;[[cloud forest]]s&quot;) growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the [[Yungas]] and parts of the Chocó, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exists, exceptions being the threatened [[Mountain Tapir]], [[Spectacled Bear]] and [[Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey]].

Birds of humid Andean forests include [[mountain-toucan]]s, [[quetzal]]s and the [[Andean Cock-of-the-rock]], while [[mixed species flock]]s dominated by [[tanagers]] and [[Furnariids]] commonly are seen - in contrast to several vocal but typically [[Crypsis|cryptic]] species of [[wrens]], [[tapaculo]]s and [[antpitta]]s.

A number of species such as the [[Royal Cinclodes]] and [[White-browed Tit-spinetail]]  are associated with ''Polylepis'', and consequently also [[threatened]].

{{refimprove|section|date=January 2011}}
[[Image:Área Cultural Andina.png|thumb|Map showing cultural influence in the Andes.]]

The Andes mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences. A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the [[Inca civilization]] and [[Inca Empire]] in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through imperialistic militarism as well as careful and meticulous governmental management.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The government sponsored the construction of [[aqueducts]] and [[roads]] in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.

Devastated by European diseases to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], and civil wars, in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. [[Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], [[Cañaris]]) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by [[Francisco Pizarro]]. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was [[Machu Picchu]], which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language]] families. [[Woodbine Parish]] and [[Joseph Barclay Pentland]] surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.

In modern times, the largest Andean cities are [[Bogota, Colombia]], with a population of about eight million, [[La Paz, Bolivia]], and [[Quito, Ecuador]].

===Transportation===
[[Image:Carretera transandina.jpg|thumb|Troncal 7 ([[Trans-Andes Highway]]) in the [[Venezuela]]n Andes.]]

Several major cities exist either in the Andes or in the foothills, among which are [[Bogotá]] and [[Cali, Colombia]]; [[Quito, Ecuador]]; [[Mérida, Venezuela]]; [[La Paz, Bolivia]]; [[Santiago, Chile]], and [[Cusco, Peru]]. These and most other cities and large towns are now connected with [[asphalt]]-paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a [[four-wheel-drive]] vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;andesmap&quot; /&gt;

[[Highway]]s and [[railroad]]s that cross the Andes are quite rare, even with modern [[civil engineering]] practices. For example, there is not one highway that crosses over the Andes between Argentina and Chile, though the ends of some highways come rather close to one another from the east and the west. By using tunnels, etc., there are one or two railroads that connect Argentina and Chile. Much of the transportation of passengers is done via [[airline]].

For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the [[War of the Pacific]] between Chile, and the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Argentina out of the war. The [[Chilean Army]] and [[Chilean Navy]] defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivia's only province on the Pacific Coast, and some land from Peru, also - that was returned to Peru later. Bolivia has been a [[landlocked]] country ever since then.

However, if Chile had kept some land to  the east, the difficulties in transportation between east and west would have been enormous. There has also been bad blood between Bolivia and Chile ever since 1870, and these two countries have not had diplomatic relations since about 1974.

Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in which  [[motorized vehicle]]s are of little use are still present. Locally, the relatives of the [[camel]], the [[llama]] and the [[alpaca]] continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times.

===Agriculture===
[[Image:Peruvianterracefarmers.jpg|thumb|Photograph of young Peruvian farmers sowing maize and beans.]]

The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practised [[irrigation]] techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The [[potato]] holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. [[Maize]] was also an important crop for these people. However, they were mainly used for the production of the culturally important [[chicha]]. Currently, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]] and [[coffee]] are the main export crops. [[Coca]], despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating [[herbal tea]], and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of [[cocaine]].

===Mining===
The Andes rose to fame for its mineral wealth during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of South America]]. Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]]s of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival. [[Potosí]] in present-day [[Bolivia]] was one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World. [[Río de la Plata]] and [[Argentina]] derive their names from the silver of Potosí.

Currently, mining in the Andes of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] place these countries as the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; major producers of [[copper]] in the world. The Bolivian Andes produce principally [[tin]] although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the [[Price revolution|economy]] of 17th century Europe.

There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish [[silver]] [[Mining|mine]]s in [[Potosí]] in the 16th century to the vast current [[porphyry copper deposit]]s of [[Chuquicamata]] and [[Escondida]] in Chile and [[Toquepala mine|Toquepala]] in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are also important.

An '''anchor''' is a device, normally made of metal, that is used to connect a [[Watercraft|vessel]] to the [[Seabed|bed]] of a body of water to prevent the vessel from drifting due to [[Leeway|wind]] or [[Ocean current|current]]. 

Anchors can either be temporary or permanent. A permanent anchor is used in the creation of a [[mooring (watercraft)#Permanent Anchor Mooring|mooring]], and is rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain it. Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors which may be of different designs and weights.

A [[sea anchor]] is an unrelated device: a [[drogue]] used to control a drifting vessel.

== Overview ==
Anchors achieve holding power by &quot;hooking&quot; into the [[seabed]], via sheer mass, or a combination of the two. Permanent moorings use large masses (commonly a block or slab of concrete) resting on this seabed. Semi-permanent mooring anchors (such as mushroom anchors) and large ship's anchors derive a significant portion of their holding power from their mass, while also hooking or embedding in the bottom. Modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal flukes which hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft bottoms.

The vessel is attached to the anchor by the [[anchor rode|rode]] which is made of [[chain]], [[cable]], [[rope]], or a combination of these. The ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope. Anchoring with sufficient scope and/or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed. This is particularly important for light modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom, where ratios of 5-7 to 1 are common, whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use 3 to 1 or less.

[[File:Stockless anchor 2 NT.PNG|thumb|right|Stockless anchor being broken out]]Since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed, anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rode until the vessel is directly above the anchor. If necessary, motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it. Anchors are sometimes fitted with a tripping line attached to the crown, by which they can be unhooked from rocks or coral.

An interesting element of anchor jargon is the term ''aweigh'', which describes the anchor when it is hanging on the rode, not resting on the bottom; this is linked to the term ''to weigh anchor'', meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed, allowing the ship or boat to move. An anchor is described as ''aweigh'' when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be ''stowed''. ''Aweigh'' should not be confused with ''under way'', which describes a vessel which is not ''moored'' to a dock or ''anchored'', whether or not it is moving through the water. Thus, a vessel can be under way (or underway) with no way on (i.e., not moving).

== Evolution of the Anchor ==
The earliest anchors were probably rocks and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Paul and McGrail, Seán (1989). ''The sea-craft of prehistory.'' London: Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-02635-2, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design.  However, using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring; trying to move a large enough rock to another bay is nearly impossible.

The ancient Greeks used baskets of stones, large sacks filled with sand, and wooden logs filled with lead, which, according to Apollonius Rhodius and Stephen of Byzantium, were formed of stone; and Athenaeus states that they were sometimes made of wood. Such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom. Iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors, and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth, or &quot;flukes&quot;, to fasten themselves into the bottom.

=== Admiralty Pattern ===
[[Image:Admiralty anchor.JPG|thumb|right|An Admiralty Pattern anchor]]
The Admiralty Pattern, &quot;A.P.&quot;, or simply &quot;[[Admiralty]]&quot;, and also known as &quot;Fisherman&quot;, is the most familiar among non-sailors. It consists of a central shank with a ring or [[shackle]] for attaching the rode. At one end of the shank there are two arms, carrying the flukes, while the stock is mounted to the other end, at ninety degrees to the arms. When the anchor lands on the bottom, it will generally fall over with the arms parallel to the seabed. As a strain comes onto the rode, the stock will dig into the bottom, canting the anchor until one of the flukes catches and digs into the bottom.

The basic design remained unchanged for centuries, with the most significant changes being to the overall proportions, and a move from wooden stocks to those of iron. Since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor, there is a great tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts. When this happens, the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom, and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re-set. In the mid-19th century, numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems, as well as improve holding power, including one-armed mooring anchors. The most successful of these ''patent anchors'', the Trotman Anchor, introduced a pivot where the arms join the shank, allowing the &quot;idle&quot; arm to fold against the shank.

Handling and stowage of these anchors requires special equipment and procedures. Once the anchor is hauled up to the [[hawsepipe]], the ring end is hoisted up to the end of a timber projecting from the bow known as the [[cathead]]. The crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail. This is known as &quot;catting and fishing&quot; the anchor. Before dropping the anchor, the fishing process is reversed, and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead.

===Stockless or Navy Pattern Anchor===
[[File:Anchor, England - scan01.jpg|thumb|right|Stockless Anchor]]
Developed in the late 19th century, stockless anchors represented the first significant departure in anchor design in centuries. Though their holding power to weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors, their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption. In contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors, stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes, and the flukes against the hull (or inside a recess in the hull).

While there are numerous variations, stockless anchors consist of a set of heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.

[[File:Stockless anchor 1 NT.PNG|thumb|left|The action of a stockless anchor being set]]

== Small Boat Anchors ==
Until the mid-20th century, anchors for smaller vessels were either scaled-down versions of admiralty anchors, or simple [[grapnels]]. As new designs with greater holding power to weight ratios, a great variety of anchor designs has emerged. Many of these designs are still under patent, and other types are best known by their original trademarked names.

=== Grapnel ===
A traditional design, the grapnel is merely a shank with four or more tines. It has a benefit in that no matter how it reaches the bottom one or more tines will be aimed to set. In coral it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure, but may be more difficult to retrieve. A grapnel is often quite light, and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard; its weight also makes it relatively easy to carry onboard.

Grapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand, clay, or mud. It is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode, or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom, preventing it from digging in. On the other hand, it is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that, without a trip line from the crown, it is impossible to retrieve. The shape is generally not very compact, and is difficult to stow, although there are a few collapsing designs available.

=== Herreshoff anchor ===
Designed by famous yacht designer [[Lewis Francis Herreshoff|L. Francis Herreshoff]], this is essentially the same pattern as an admiralty anchor, albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms. The novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage. In use, it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor.

=== Northill anchor ===
Originally designed as a lightweight anchor for seaplanes, this design consists of two plow-like blades mounted to a shank, with a folding stock crossing through the crown of the anchor.

=== CQR (Clyde Quick Release) Plough anchor ===
[[Image:Genuine CQR.jpg|thumb|right|CQR anchor]]
So named due to its resemblance to a traditional agricultural [[plough]] (or more specifically two [[plowshare|ploughshares]]), many manufacturers produce a plough-style design, all based on or direct copies of the original CQR (Secure), a 1933 design by mathematician [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, G. I.|authorlink=Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|title=The history of an invention|year=1974|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications|volume=10|pages=367–368|doi=10.1017/S0022112086001040}} Cited by {{cite journal|author=Batchelor, G. K.|title=Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, 7 March 1886–27 June 1975|year=1986|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume=173|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/S0022112086001040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ploughs are popular with cruising sailors and other private boaters. They are generally good in all bottoms, but not exceptional in any. The CQR design has a hinged shank, allowing the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out, while other plough types have a rigid shank. Plough anchors are usually stowed in a roller at the bow.

Owing to the use of lead or other dedicated tip-weight, the plough is heavier than average for the amount of resistance developed, and may take a slightly longer pull to set thoroughly. It cannot be stored in a hawse pipe.

=== Danforth or Fluke anchor===
[[Image:Fluke anchor-1-.gif|thumb|right|A fluke-style anchor]]
American Richard Danforth invented the Danforth pattern in the 1940s for use aboard [[landing craft]]. It uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat triangular flukes are attached. The stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom (and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type). Tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed. The design is a burying variety, and once well set can develop high resistance. Its light weight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store; some anchor rollers and hawsepipes can accommodate a fluke-style anchor.

The fluke anchor has difficulty penetrating kelp and weed-covered bottoms, as well as rocky and particularly hard sand or clay bottoms. If there is much current or the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor it may &quot;kite&quot; or &quot;skate&quot; over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing. Once set, the anchor tends to break out and reset when the direction of force changes dramatically, such as with the changing tide, and on some occasions it might not reset but instead drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Miles|journal=Yachting Monthly|year=1988|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising|year=1994|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312|isbn=9781574090932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Springer|first=Bill|journal=Sail|year=2006|month=October}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Yachting Monthly [Editor's Log]|year=2006|month=December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bruce/ Claw ===
[[Image:Genuine Bruce anchor.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce anchor]]
This claw shaped anchor was designed by Peter Bruce from the [[Isle of Man]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Peter, {{US Patent|4,397,256}} August 9, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruce gained its early reputation from the production of large scale commercial anchors for ships and fixed installations such as oil rigs. The Bruce and its copies, known generically as &quot;claws&quot;, have become a popular option for small boaters. It was intended to address some of the problems of the only general-purpose option then available, the plough. Claw-types set quickly in most seabeds and although not an articulated design, they have the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes, instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force.

Claw types have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms and grass. They offer a fairly low holding power to weight ratio and generally have to be over-sized to compete with other types. On the other hand they perform relatively well with low rode scopes and set fairly reliably. They cannot be used with hawse pipes.

=== Recent designs ===
[[Image:Genuine Rocna.jpg|thumb|right|Rocna anchor]]
In recent years there has been something of a spurt in anchor design. Primarily designed to set very quickly, then generate high holding power, these anchors (mostly proprietary inventions still under [[patent]]) are finding homes with users of small to medium sized vessels.
* The German designed bow anchor, '''Bügelanker''' (or '''Wasi'''), has a sharp tip for penetrating weed, and features a roll-bar which allows the correct setting attitude to be achieved without the need for extra weight to be inserted into the tip.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg-Klemmt, Erika &amp; Achim, and Poiraud, Alain: &quot;The Complete Anchoring Handbook&quot;, Ragged Mountain Press, 2007 (ISBN 0-07-147508-7)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Bulwagga''' is a unique design featuring three flukes instead of the usual two. It has performed well in tests by independent sources such as American boating magazine ''Practical Sailor''.&lt;ref&gt;Practical Sailor: &quot;Anchor Reset Tests&quot;, Belvoir Pubs, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Spade''' is a French design which has proved successful since 1996. It features a demountable shank and the choice of galvanized steel, stainless steel, or aluminium construction, which means a lighter and more easily stowable anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Poiraud, Alain: &quot;Tout savoir sur le mouillage&quot;, Loisirs Nautiques, 2003 (ISBN 2-914423-46-2)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The New Zealand designed '''Rocna''' has been produced since 2004. It too features a sharp toe like the Bügel for penetrating weed and grass, sets quickly,&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Colin: &quot;Gear Test: Rocna Anchor&quot;, Boating NZ, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and has a particularly large fluke area. Its roll-bar is also similar to that of the Bügel. The Rocna obtained the highest averaged holding power in SAIL magazine's comparison testing in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hisse-et-oh.com/articles/article.php?article=367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accademiavelica.it/IT/documentazione/_prova-ancore/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Temporary Anchors ===

* '''Mud weight''': Consists of a blunt heavy weight, usually cast iron or cast lead, that will sink into the mud and resist lateral movement. Suitable only for very soft silt bottoms and in mild conditions. Sizes range between 5 and 20&amp;nbsp;kg for small craft. Various designs exist and many are home produced from lead or improvised with heavy objects. This is a very commonly used method on the [[Norfolk Broads]] in England.

== Permanent anchors  ==

These are used where the vessel is permanently sited, for example in the case of [[lightvessel]]s or channel marker [[buoy]]s. The anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers, including the most severe [[storm]], but only occasionally, or never, needs to be lifted, only for example if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance. An alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances may be to use a pile driven into the seabed.

Permanent anchors come in a wide range of types and have no standard form. A slab of rock with an iron staple in it to attach a chain to would serve the purpose, as would any dense object of appropriate weight (e.g. an engine block). Modern moorings may be anchored by sand screws which look and act very much like over-sized screws drilled into the seabed, or by barbed metal beams pounded in (or even driven in with explosives) like pilings, or a variety of other non-mass means of getting a grip on the bottom. One method of building a mooring is to use three or more conventional anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel, so no matter which direction the vessel moves one or more anchors will be aligned to resist the force.

=== Mushroom ===
[[Image:Portsmouth with mushroom anchor.jpg|thumb|Mushroom Anchor on the [[lightvessel|Lightship]] Portsmouth in [[Virginia]].]]
The mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand.  It was invented by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]], for use by an 82 ton converted fishing boat, ''Pharos'', which was used as a [[lightvessel]] between 1807 and 1810 near to [[Inchcape|Bell Rock]] whilst the [[Bell Rock Lighthouse|lighthouse]] was being constructed. It was equipped with a 1.5 ton example.

It is shaped like an inverted mushroom, the head becoming buried in the silt.  A counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried.

A mushroom anchor will normally sink in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material, thus greatly increasing its holding power. These anchors are only suitable for a silt or mud bottom, since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material, which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack. The holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight unti it becomes buried, when it can be as much as ten times its weight [http://www.inamarmarine.com/pdf/Moorings.pdf]. They are available in sizes from about 10&amp;nbsp;lb up to several tons.

=== Deadweight ===

This is an anchor which relies solely on being a heavy weight. It is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain. Its holding power is defined by its weight underwater (i.e. taking its buoyancy into account) regardless of the type of seabed, although suction can increase this if it becomes buried. Consequently deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable, for example in rock, gravel or coarse sand. An advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged, then it continues to provide its original holding force. The disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor.

=== Screw ===

Screw anchors can be used to anchor permanent moorings, floating docks, fish farms, etc. These anchors must be screwed into the seabed with the use of a tool, so require access to the bottom, either at low tide or by use of a diver. Hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment.

Weight for weight, screw anchors have a higher holding than other permanent designs, and so can be cheap and relatively easily installed, although may not be ideal in extremely soft mud.

== Anchoring gear ==

The elements of anchoring gear include the anchor, the cable (also called a ''rode''), the method of attaching the two together, the method of attaching the cable to the ship, charts, and a method of learning the depth of the water.

Vessels may carry a number of anchors: ''Bower Anchors'' (formerly known as ''Sheet Anchors'') are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel.  A ''Kedge Anchor'' is a light anchor used for [[Anchor#Kedging|kedging]], or more commonly on yachts for [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] quickly. or in benign conditions.  A ''Killick Anchor'' is a small, possibly improvised, anchor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-kil1.htm World Wide Words]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pussers.com/scuttlebutt/view/33 The &quot;Pusser's Anchor&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charts are vital to good anchoring. Knowing the location of potential dangers, as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage, is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook. One can get by without referring to charts, but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear, and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them.

The depth of water is necessary for determining ''scope'', which is the ratio of length of cable to the depth measured from the highest point (usually the anchor roller or bow chock) to the seabed. For example, if the water is 25&amp;nbsp;ft (8 m) deep, and the anchor roller is 3&amp;nbsp;ft (1 m) above the water, the scope is the ratio between the amount of cable let out and 28&amp;nbsp;ft (9 m). For this reason it is important to have a reliable and accurate method of measuring the depth of water.

A cable or rode is the rope, chain, or combination thereof used to connect the anchor to the vessel. Neither rope nor chain is fundamentally superior to a cable.

== Anchoring techniques ==
[[Image:Polarstern anchor-winch hg.jpg|thumb|Anchor winch on [[RV Polarstern]]]]
[[Image:Chain markers.jpg|thumb|Colored plastic inserts on a modern anchor chain show the operator how much chain has been paid out. This knowledge is very important in all anchoring methods]]
The basic anchoring consists of determining the location, dropping the anchor, laying out the scope, setting the hook, and assessing where the vessel ends up. The ship will seek a location which is sufficiently protected; has suitable holding ground, enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing.

The location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back. The anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom. The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight.

Once the desired scope is laid out, the vessel should be gently forced astern, usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail. A hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts, indicating the anchor is dragging, or a smooth tension indicative of digging in. As the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force, the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set. If the anchor continues to drag, or sets after having dragged too far, it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position (or another location chosen.)

With the anchor set in the correct location, everything should be reconsidered. 

Some other techniques have been developed to reduce swing, or to deal with heavy weather.

=== Protection ===

A good anchorage offers protection from the current weather conditions, and will also offer protection from the expected weather. The anchorage should also be suitable for other purposes; for example, proximity to shore is beneficial if the crew plans to land.

=== Seabed ===

Charts should indicate the type of bottom, and a sounding lead may be used to collect a sample from the bottom for analysis. Generally speaking, most anchors will hold well in sandy mud, mud and clay, or firm sand. Loose sand and soft mud are not desirable bottoms, especially soft mud which should be avoided if at all possible. Rock, coral, and shale prevent anchors from digging in, although some anchors are designed to hook into such a bottom. Grassy bottoms may be good holding, but only if the anchor can penetrate the foliage.

=== Depth and tides ===

If the anchorage is affected by [[tide]], tide ranges, as well as the times of high and low water, should be known. Enough depth is needed so that low tide does not present obstacles to where the vessel might swing. This is also important when determining scope, which should be figured for high tide and not the current tide state.

=== Swing range ===

If the anchorage is affected by tide, the swing range will be larger at low tide than at high tide. However, no matter where the vessel is anchored, the largest possible swing range should be considered, as well as what obstacles and hazards might be within that range. Other vessels' swing ranges may overlap, presenting a further variable. Boats on permanent moorings, or shorter scope, may not swing as far as expected, or may swing either more rapidly or more slowly (all-chain cables tend to swing more slowly than all-rope or chain-and-rope cables.)

There are techniques of anchoring to limit the swing of a vessel if the anchorage has limited room.

==== Using an anchor weight, kellet or sentinel ====

Lowering a concentrated, heavy weight down the anchor line – rope or chain – directly in front of the bow to the seabed, behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the angle of pull on the anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, Earl R.; The Complete Book of Anchoring and Mooring, first ed., 1986, Cornell Maritime Press; ISBN 0-87033-348-8&lt;/ref&gt; If the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag. In light conditions, a kellet will reduce the swing of the vessel considerably. In heavier conditions these effects disappear as the rode becomes straightened and the weight ineffective. Known as a &quot;anchor chum weight&quot; or &quot;angel&quot; in the UK.

==== Forked moor ====

Using two anchors set approximately 45° apart, or wider angles up to 90°, from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds. To set anchors in this way, first one anchor is set in the normal fashion. Then, taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back, a second anchor is set approximately a half-scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind. After this second anchor is set, the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable.

This moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel's swing to a narrower oval. Care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range.

==== Bow and stern ====

Not to be mistaken with the '''[[Anchor#Bahamian moor|Bahamian moor]]''', below.

In the ''Bow and Stern'' technique, an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern, which can severely limit a vessel's swing range and also align it to steady wind, current or wave conditions. One method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally, then drop back to the limit of the bow cable (or to double the desired scope, e.g. 8:1 if the eventual scope should be 4:1, 10:1 if the eventual scope should be 5:1, etc.) to lower a stern anchor. By taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set. After both anchors are set, tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel.

==== Bahamian moor ====

Similar to the above, a ''Bahamian moor'' is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel, but allows it to swing to a current. One of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows: the first anchor is set normally, and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable. A second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable, and is dropped and set. A swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable, and the vessel connected to that.

The vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors, which is acceptable in strong reversing currents but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors as they are not aligned for this load.

==== Backing an anchor ====

Also known as ''Tandem anchoring'', in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other, on the same rode. With the foremost anchor reducing the load on the aft-most, this technique can develop great holding power and may be appropriate in &quot;ultimate storm&quot; circumstances. It does not limit swinging range, and might not be suitable in some circumstances. There are complications and the technique requires careful preparation and a level of skill and experience above that required for a single anchor.

=== Kedging ===
[[Image:Памятник Петру 1.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of Peter the Great leaning on an anchor, in symbol of that Tsar's shipbuilding activity ([[Voronezh]], 1860).]]

''Kedging'' is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor known as a ''kedge''.

In yachts, a kedge anchor is an anchor carried in addition to the main, or bower anchors, and usually stowed aft. Every yacht should carry at least two anchors – the main or ''bower'' anchor and a second lighter ''kedge'' anchor. It is used occasionally when it is necessary to limit the turning circle as the yacht swings when it is anchored, such as in a very narrow river or a deep pool in an otherwise shallow area.

For ships, a kedge may be dropped while a ship is underway, or carried out in a suitable direction by a tender or ship's boat to enable the ship to be winched off if aground or swung into a particular heading, or even to be held steady against a tidal or other stream.

Historically, it was of particular relevance to sailing warships which used them to out-maneuver opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined, shoal water to place it in a more desirable position, provided she had enough manpower.

==== Club hauling ====

Club hauling is an archaic technique, and may be considered a variety of kedging: when a sailing vessel is in a narrow channel or on a lee shore so that there is no room to tack the vessel in a conventional manner an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow.  This is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway.  As the vessel gathers sternway the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack.  The anchor is then normally cut away as it cannot be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjohistoriskasamfundet.se/LB/Nautica/Seamanship/Liardet/Liardet%281849%29_p72.html] Francis Liardet: Professional Recollections on Points of Seamanship, Discipline, &amp;c., 1849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/vbb/woronora/maritime/working.html] General Principles of Working a Ship, from The New Practical Navigator (1814).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Heraldry==
[[Image:Triple Entente.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1914 Russian poster depicting the [[Triple Entente]]. Britannia's association with the oceanic [[British Empire]] is indicated by her holding a large anchor.]]

An anchor frequently appears on the flags and coats-of-arms of institutions involved with the sea, both naval and commercial, as well as of port cities and seacoast regions and provinces in various countries.

There also exists in heraldry the &quot;[[Anchored Cross]]&quot;, or [[Cross#As_emblems_and_symbols|Mariner's Cross]], a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor. The symbol can be used to signify 'fresh start' or 'hope'.

The Mariner's Cross is also referred to as [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement's Cross]] in reference to the way this saint was martyred (being tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the [[Black Sea]] in the year [[102]]).

Anchored crosses are occasionally a feature of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] in which context they are referred to by the [[heraldry|heraldic]] terms ''anchry'' or ''ancre''.

'''Anbar''' ('''{{lang|ar|الأنبار}}''') was a town in [[Iraq]], at lat. 33 deg.  22' N., long. 43 deg.  49' E, on the east bank of the [[Euphrates]], just south of the Nahr 'Isa, or Sakhlawieh [[canal]], the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the [[Tigris]].

==History==
Anbar was originally called '''Firuz Shapur''' ('''Firuz Shabur'''), or '''Perisapora''' and was founded circa [[350]] [[AD]] by [[Shapur II]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king of [[Persia]]. Perisapora was captured and destroyed by Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in [[363]], but speedily rebuilt.  The town became a refuge for the [[Arab]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Jew]]ish colonies of that region.{{sfn|Peters|1911}} Anbar was adjacent or identical to the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism (219 AD - ~1050 AD)|Babylonian Jewish]]  center of [[Nehardea]] (Hebrew: '''{{lang|he|נהרדעא}}'''), and lies a short distance from the present-day town of [[Fallujah]], formerly the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism (219 AD - ~1050 AD)|Babylonian Jewish]] center of [[Pumbeditha]] ([[Hebrew]]: '''{{lang|he|פומבדיתא}}).

The name of the town was then changed to Anbar (&quot;[[granaries]]&quot;). [[As-Saffah|Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah]], the founder of the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, made it his capital, and such it remained until the founding of [[Baghdad]] in [[762]]. It continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}

==Today==
It is now it is entirely deserted, occupied only by ruin mounds. The great number of these indicates the former importance of the city.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}

'''Anazarbus in Ancient Cilicia (Adana)''' (med. '''Ain Zarba'''; mod. Anavarza) was an ancient [[Cilicia]]n city, situated in [[Anatolia]] in modern [[Turkey]], in the present [[Çukurova]] (or classical [[Aleian plain]]) about 15&amp;nbsp;km west of the main stream of the present [[Ceyhan River]] (or classical [[Pyramus river]]) and near its tributary the [[Sempas Su]].

A lofty isolated ridge formed its [[acropolis]]. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the [[Suda]]'s identification of it with [[Cyinda]], famous as a treasure city in the wars of [[Eumenes of Cardia]], cannot be accepted in the face of [[Strabo]]'s express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.

Under the early [[Roman empire]] the place was known as '''Caesarea''', and was the metropolis of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. Rebuilt by the emperor [[Justin I]] after an [[earthquake]], it became '''Justinopolis''' (525); but the old native name persisted, and when [[Thoros I of Armenia|Thoros I]], king of [[Lesser Armenia]], made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as '''Anazarva'''.

Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the [[Sis pass]], and near the great road which [[debouches|debouched]] from the [[Cilician Gates]], made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the early [[Muslim]] invaders. It had been rebuilt by [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 796, refortified at great expense by [[Saif ad-Daula]], the [[Hamdanid]] (10th century) and sacked, and ruined by the crusaders.

The present wall of the lower city is of late construction, probably Armenian.  It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside on the south.  The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock; but beyond ruins of two churches and a fine tower built by Thoros I. There are no notable structures in the upper town.  For picturesqueness the site is not equalled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct]]s to their sources.

A visit in December, 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.

An '''anagram''' is a type of [[word play]], the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; e.g., ''orchestra'' = ''carthorse'', ''A decimal point'' = ''I'm a dot in place''.  Someone who creates anagrams is called an '''anagrammatist'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anagrammatist Anagrammatist], www.dictionary.com. Retrieved on 2008-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original word or phrase is known as the ''subject'' of the anagram.

Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. However, the goal of serious or skilled anagrammatists is to produce anagrams that in some way reflect or comment on the subject.  Such an anagram may be a synonym or antonym of its subject, a parody, a criticism, or praise; e.g. ''[[George W. Bush|George Bush]]'' = ''He bugs Gore''; ''[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna Louise Ciccone]]'' = ''Occasional nude income'' or ''One cool dance musician''; ''[[William Shakespeare]]'' = ''I am a weakish speller'', ''[[Roger Meddows-Taylor]]'' = ''Great words or melody''.

==Assumptions==
[[Image:Anagram.jpg|right|280px|thumb|Illustration of an anagram by [[George Herbert]]]]
The creation of anagrams assumes an [[alphabet]], the symbols of which are to be permuted. In a perfect anagram, every letter must be used, with exactly the same number of occurrences as in the anagrammed word or phrase; any result that falls short is called an '''imperfect anagram'''. [[Diacritic]]s are usually disregarded (this is usually not relevant for English anagrams), and standard [[orthography]] is to be used.

==History==
Anagrams can be traced back to the time of Moses, as &quot;Themuru&quot; or changing, which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names.&lt;ref&gt;Of Anagrams, By H.B. Wheatley pg.72 printed 1862 T. &amp; W. Boone, New Bond Street, London&lt;/ref&gt;
They were popular throughout [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], for example with the poet and composer [[Guillaume de Machaut]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoasm.org/IID/Machaut.html HOASM]&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to go back at least to the Greek poet [[Lycophron]], in the third century BCE;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lycophron The LoveToKnow Free Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; but this relies on an account of Lycophron given by [[John Tzetzes]] in the 12th century.

Anagrams in [[Latin language|Latin]] were considered witty over many centuries. &quot;Est vir qui adest&quot;, explained below, was cited as the example in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]''.

Any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings  that were current for the language in question. In particular spelling in English only slowly became fixed. There were attempts to regulate anagram formation, an important one in English being that of [[George Puttenham]]'s ''Of the Anagram or Posy Transposed'' in ''The Art of English Poesie'' (1589).

===Influence of Latin===
As a literary game when Latin was the common property of the literate, Latin anagrams were prominent: two examples are the change of &quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum&quot; (''Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you'') into &quot;Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata&quot; (''Serene virgin, pious, clean and spotless''), and the anagrammatic answer to [[Pilate]]'s question, &quot;Quid est veritas?&quot; (''What is truth?''), namely, &quot;Est vir qui adest&quot; (''It is the man who is here''). The origins of these are not documented.

Latin continued to influence letter values (such as I = J, U = V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be &quot;perfect&quot; if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the [[Jesuits]]: &quot;Societas Jesu&quot; turned into &quot;Vitiosa seces&quot;, or &quot;cut off the wicked things&quot;. Puttenham, in the time of [[Elizabeth I of England]], wished to start from ''Elissabet Anglorum Regina'' (Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain ''Multa regnabis ense gloria'' (By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is &quot;a note of aspiration only and no letter&quot;, and that Z in Greek or Hebrew is a mere SS. The rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century. [[William Camden]] in his ''Remains'' commented, singling out some letters&amp;mdash;Æ, K, W, Z&amp;mdash;not found in the classical Roman alphabet:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Henry Benjamin Wheatley, ''Of anagrams: a monograph treating of their history'' (1862); [http://www.archive.org/details/ofanagramsmonogr00wheauoft online text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The precise in this practice strictly observing all the parts of the definition, are only bold with H either in omitting or retaining it, for that it cannot challenge the right of a letter. But the Licentiats somewhat licentiously, lest they should prejudice poetical liberty, will pardon themselves for doubling or rejecting a letter, if the sence fall aptly, and think it no injury to use E for Æ; V for W; S for Z, and C for K, and contrariwise.|William Camden|''Remains''}}

===Early modern period===
When it comes to the 17th century and anagrams in English or other languages, there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest. The lawyer [[Thomas Egerton]] was praised through the anagram ''gestat honorem''; the physician [[George Ent]] took the anagrammatic motto ''genio surget'', which requires his first name as &quot;Georgius&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Articles from the ''Dictionary of National Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James I of England|James I's]] courtiers discovered in &quot;James Stuart&quot; &quot;a just master&quot;, and converted &quot;[[Charles II of England|Charles James Stuart]]&quot; into &quot;Claims [[King Arthur|Arthur]]'s seat&quot; (even at that point in time, the letters I and J were more-or-less interchangeable). Walter Quin, tutor to the future Charles I, worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father James.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; A notorious murder scandal, the Overbury case, threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by [[Simonds D'Ewes]]: 'Francis Howard' (for [[Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset]], her maiden name spelled in a variant) became ''Car findes a whore'', with the letters E hardly counted, and the victim [[Thomas Overbury]], as 'Thomas Overburie', was written as ''O! O! a busie murther'', with a V counted as U.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlystuartlibels.net/htdocs/overbury_murder_section/H21.html Early Stuart Libels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlystuartlibels.net/htdocs/overbury_murder_section/H22.html Early Stuart Libels]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Drummond of Hawthornden]], in an essay ''On the Character of a Perfect Anagram'', tried to lay down permissible rules (such as S standing for Z), and possible letter omissions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Benjamin Wheatley]], ''On Anagrams'' (1862) , p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Camden]]&lt;ref&gt;''Remains,'' 7th ed., 1674.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a definition of &quot;Anagrammatisme&quot; as &quot;a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, subtraction or change of any letter, into different words, making some perfect sense applyable (i.e., ''applicable'') to the person named.&quot; [[John Dryden|Dryden]] in ''[[MacFlecknoe]]'' disdainfully called the pastime the &quot;torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame
In keen iambics, but mild anagram:
Leave writing plays, and choose for thy command
Some peaceful province in acrostic land.
There thou may'st wings display and altars raise,
And torture one poor word ten thousand ways.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Eleanor Audeley&quot;, wife of [[Sir John Davies]], is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to &quot;Reveale, O Daniel&quot;, and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by [[Sir John Lambe]], the [[Dean of Arches|dean of the Arches]], &quot;Dame Eleanor Davies&quot;, &quot;Never soe mad a ladie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Book of Word Games''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], ''Archbishop Laud'' (2000), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example from France was a flattering anagram for [[Cardinal Richelieu]], comparing him to [[Hercules]] or at least one of his hands (Hercules being a kingly symbol), where &quot;Armand de Richelieu&quot; became &quot;Ardue main d'Hercule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. van Helsdingen, ''Notes on Two Sheets of Sketches by Nicolas Poussin for the Long Gallery of the Louvre'', Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 5, No. 3/4 (1971), pp. 172-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
Examples from the nineteenth century are the transposition of &quot;[[Horatio Nelson]]&quot; into &quot;Honor est a Nilo&quot; (Latin = ''Honor is from the [[Nile]]''); and of &quot;[[Florence Nightingale]]&quot; into &quot;Flit on, cheering angel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;1911 Britannica article &quot;anagram&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by [[Augustus De Morgan]]&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Budget of Paradoxes'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; using his own name as example; &quot;Great Gun, do us a sum!&quot; is attributed to his son [[William De Morgan]], but a family friend [[John T. Graves|John Thomas Graves]] was prolific, and a manuscript with over 2,800 has been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Edoward Moritz, ''On Mathematics and Mathematicians'' (2007), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Stirling, ''William De Morgan and His Wife'' (1922) p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/13/3491.htm AIM25 home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[surrealism]] as a poetic movement, anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the [[Baroque period]]. The German poet [[Unica Zürn]], who made extensive use of anagram techniques, came to regard obsession with anagrams as a &quot;dangerous fever&quot;, because it created isolation of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Friederike Ursula Eigler, Susanne Kord, The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature (1997), pp. 14-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The surrealist leader [[André Breton]] coined the anagram ''Avida Dollars'' for [[Salvador Dalí]], to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism.

==Applications==
While anagramming is certainly a recreation first, there are ways in which anagrams are put to use, and these can be more serious, or at least not quite frivolous and formless. For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called &quot;anagram solution tasks&quot;, to assess the [[implicit memory]] of young adults and adults alike.&lt;ref name = Java&gt;Java, Rosalind I. &quot;Priming and Aging: Evidence of Preserved Memory Function in an Anagram Solution Task.&quot; ''The American Journal of Psychology'', Vol. 105, No. 4. (Winter, 1992), pp. 541–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of priority===
Natural philosophers (astronomers and others) of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into Latin anagrams, to establish their priority. In this way they laid claim to new discoveries, before their results were ready for publication.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] used ''smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras'' for ''Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi'' (&quot;I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form&quot;) for discovering the [[rings of Saturn]] in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Galileo announced his discovery that [[Venus]] had [[Moon phase|phases]] like the Moon in the form &quot;Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur -oy&quot; (Latin: ''These immature ones have already been read in vain by me -oy''), that is, when rearranged, &quot;Cynthiae figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum&quot; (Latin: ''The Mother of Loves [= Venus] imitates the figures of [[Cynthia]] [= the moon]'').

When [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in 1660, he first published it in anagram form, ''ceiiinosssttuv'', for ''ut tensio, sic vis'' (Latin: ''as the tension, so the force'').&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gjertsen, ''The Newton Handbook'' (1986), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related use, from 1975, British naturalist [[Sir Peter Scott]] coined the scientific term &quot;Nessiteras rhombopteryx&quot; (Greek for &quot;The monster (or wonder) of [[Loch Ness|Ness]] with the diamond shaped fin&quot;) for the [[apocryphal]] [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Shortly afterwards, several London newspapers pointed out that &quot;Nessiteras rhombopteryx&quot; anagrams into &quot;Monster hoax by Sir Peter S&quot;. However, [[Robert Rines]], who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster, countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into &quot;Yes, both pix are monsters, R.&quot;

===Pseudonyms===
Anagrams are connected to [[pseudonym]]s, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal, or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity. For example, [[Jim Morrison]] used an anagram of his name in [[the Doors]] song ''[[L.A. Woman]]'', calling himself &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin' &quot;. The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when [[Edward Cave]] wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/pooleyj.html Institute of Historical Research (IHR) home page]&lt;/ref&gt; In a genre such as [[farce]] or [[parody]], anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.

Pseudonyms adopted by [[author]]s are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus &quot;Calvinus&quot; becomes &quot;Alcuinus&quot; (here V = U) or &quot;[[François Rabelais]]&quot; = &quot;Alcofribas Nasier&quot;. The name &quot;[[Voltaire]]&quot; of François Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of &quot;Arouet, l[e] j[eune]&quot; (U = V, J = I) that is, &quot;Arouet the younger&quot;.  Other examples: &quot;[[Arrigo Boito]]&quot; = &quot;Tobia Gorrio&quot;; &quot;[[Edward Gorey]]&quot; = &quot;Ogdred Weary&quot;, = &quot;Regera Dowdy&quot; or = &quot;E. G. Deadworry&quot; (and others); &quot;[[Vladimir Nabokov]]&quot; = &quot;Vivian Darkbloom&quot;, = &quot;Vivian Bloodmark&quot;, = &quot;Blavdak Vinomori&quot; or = &quot;Dorian Vivalcomb&quot;; &quot;[[Bryan Waller Proctor]]&quot; = &quot;Barry Cornwall, poet&quot;; &quot;[[Bernardo Soares]]&quot; = &quot;Fernando Pessoa, poet&quot;; &quot;(Sanche) de Gramont&quot; = &quot;[[Ted Morgan]]&quot;; &quot;[[Dave Barry]]&quot;=&quot;Ray Adverb&quot;; &quot;Declan Gunn&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)]]&lt;/ref&gt; = [[Glen Duncan]]; Dan Abnormal = [[Damon Albarn]]; and so on. Several of these are &quot;imperfect anagrams&quot;, letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.

===Titles===
Anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit. Examples:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is an anagram for the Danish Prince [[Amleth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9217|title=Anagrams|last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=2009-11-29|work=Word Play|publisher=Criminal Brief}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Homer Hickam, Jr.]]'s book ''[[Rocket Boys]]'' was adapted into the 1999 film ''[[October Sky]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CB&quot; /&gt;
* The tapes for the revival of [[BBC]] show [[Doctor Who]] were labeled with the anagram Torchwood, which later went on to be used as the name for a [[Torchwood|spin-off show]].
* The New Wave band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]' best-selling album was called ''[[Spring Session M]]''.
* Hip-hop artist [[MF DOOM]] recorded a 2004 album called ''[[MM..FOOD]]''.
* [[Brian Eno]]'s album ''Before and After Science'' includes a song entitled &quot;King's Lead Hat&quot;, an anagram of &quot;[[Talking Heads]]&quot;, a band Eno has worked with.
* [[Juan Maria Solare]]'s piano ballad &quot;Jura ser anomalía&quot; (literally &quot;he/she swears to be an anomaly&quot;) is an anagram of the composer's full name.
* [[Bill Evans]]'s overdubbed piano elegy for fellow jazz pianist [[Sonny Clark]] is titled &quot;N.Y.C.'s No Lark,&quot; and another composition, &quot;Re: Person I Knew&quot; is a tribute to his producer, [[Orrin Keepnews]].
* [[Imogen Heap]]'s album ''[[iMegaphone]]'' has a title that is an anagram of the singer's name.

===Games and puzzles===
Anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and [[game show]]s. The [[Jumble]] is a puzzle found in many [[newspapers]] in the [[United States]] requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. [[Cryptic crossword]] puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like &quot;confused&quot; or &quot;in disarray&quot;. An example would be ''Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)''. The solution, ''stationer'', is an anagram of ''into tears'', the letters of which have ''burst'' out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of ''businessman''.

Numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:
*In [[Anagrams]], players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can &quot;steal&quot; each others' words by rearranging the letters and extending the words.
*In a version of [[Scrabble]] called [[Clabbers]], the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.
*On the British game show ''[[countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters.
*In [[Boggle]], players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes.
*On the British game show ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a &quot;Pyramid&quot; which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.
*In [[Bananagrams]], players place tiles from a pool into [[crossword puzzle|crossword-style]] word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first.

===Ciphers===
Multiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a [[permutation cipher]], a [[transposition cipher]], and the [[Jefferson disk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page55.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of construction==
Sometimes it is possible to &quot;see&quot; anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. [[Anagram dictionary|Anagram dictionaries]] could also be used. Computer programs, known as &quot;anagram servers&quot;, &quot;anagram solvers&quot; or &quot;anagrammers&quot;, offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the [[Internet]]. The [[Computer program|program]] or [[Server (computing)|server]] carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase. Some programs (such as ''Lexpert'') restrict to one-word answers.  Many anagram servers can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results.  Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations.  Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations. 

Some anagrammatists indicate the method they used.  Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done &quot;manually&quot; or &quot;by hand&quot;; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted &quot;by machine&quot; or &quot;by computer&quot;, or may indicate the name of the computer program (using ''Anagram Genius'').

There are also a few &quot;natural&quot; instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French ''chaise longue'' (&quot;long chair&quot;) became the American &quot;[[chaise lounge]]&quot; by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English &quot;curd&quot; comes from the Latin ''crudus'' (&quot;raw&quot;).

'''Anadyr''' ({{lang-ru|Ана́дырь}}) is a river in the far northeast Siberia which flows into [[Anadyr Bay]] of the [[Bering Sea]] and drains much of the interior of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]. Its basin corresponds to the [[Anadyrsky District]] of Chukotka.

It is {{convert|1146|km}} long and has a basin of {{convert|191000|km2|-3}}. It is frozen from October to late May and has a maximum flow in June with the snowmelt.  It is navigable in small boats for about {{convert|570|km}} to near [[Markovo, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Markovo]]. West of Markovo it is in the Anadyr Highlands (moderate mountains and valleys with a few trees) and east of Markovo it moves into the Anadyr lowlands (very flat treeless tundra with lakes and bogs).  The drop from Markovo to the sea is less than {{convert|100|ft}}.

It rises at about 67°N latitude and 173°E longitude near the headwaters of the [[Maly Anyuy River]], flows southwest receiving the waters of the Yablon and Eropol Rivers, turns east and passes [[Markovo, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Markvovo]] and the old site of [[Anadyrsk]], turns north and east and receives the [[Mayn River]] from the south, thereby encircling the  Lebediny [[Zakaznik]], turns northeast to receive the [[Belaya River (Chukotka)]] from the north, turns southeast past the Ust-Tanyurer [[Zakaznik]] and receives the [[Tanyurer River]] from the north. At [[Lake Krasnoye]], it turns east and flows into the Onemen Bay of the [[Anadyr Estuary]].  If the Onemen Bay is considered part of the river, it also receives the [[Velikaya River (Chukotka)]] from the south and the [[Kanchalan River]] from the north.

Its basin is surrounded by (north) [[Amguyema River]] and [[Palyavaam River]], (northwest) [[Bolshoy Anyuy River]] and the Oloy branch of the [[Omolon River]] and (southwest) [[Penzhin Bay|Penzhina River]].

==History==
In 1648 [[Semyon Dezhnyov|Semyon Dezhnev]] reached the mouth of the Anadyr after being shipwrecked on the coast.  In 1649 he went upriver and built winter quarters at [[Anadyrsk]]. For the next 100 years the Anadyr was the main route from the Arctic to the Pacific and Kamchatka. In the 18th century, the Anadyr was described by the polar explorer [[Dmitry Laptev]].

==Ecology==
The country through which it passes is thinly populated, and is dominated by [[tundra]], with a rich variety of plant life.&lt;ref&gt;The area, which is still sparsely populated today, in 1911 it was described as &quot;thinly populated&quot; {{harvnb|Anonymous|1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the region has beautiful landscapes, dominated by often spectacular, rugged mountains. For nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow, and the frozen rivers become navigable roads.  George Kennan, an American working on the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] in the late 1860s, found that dog sled travel on the lower Anadyr was limited by lack of firewood.

[[Reindeer]], upon which the local inhabitants subsisted, were once found in considerable numbers,&lt;ref&gt;This point was made in 1911: &quot;Reindeer, upon which the inhabitants subsist, are found in considerable numbers&quot; {{harvnb|Anonymous|1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in 1992. As herds of domestic reindeer have declined, herds of wild [[caribou]] have increased.

There are ten species of [[salmon]] inhabiting the Anadyr river basin.  Every year, on the last Sunday in April, there is an ice fishing competition in the frozen estuarine waters of the Anadyr River's mouth. This festival is locally known as '''Korfest'''.

The area is a summering place for a number of migratory birds including [[Brent Goose|Brent geese]], [[Eurasian Wigeon]]s, and the [[Northern Pintail|pintails]] of [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Henny, Charles J.

'''André-Marie Ampère''' (20 January 1775 – 10 June 1836) was a [[French people|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who is generally regarded as one of the main discoverers of [[electromagnetism]].  The [[SI]] unit of measurement of [[electric current]], the [[ampere]], is named after him.

==Early days==
Ampère was born in [[Lyon]], France on 20 January 1775. He spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at [[Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or]] near Lyon. His father began to teach him [[Latin]], until he discovered the boy's preference and aptitude for mathematical studies. The young Ampère, however, soon resumed his Latin lessons, to enable him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]].  In later life Ampère claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a [[polymath]], his reading embraced history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and the natural sciences.  

During the [[French Revolution]], Ampere's father stayed at [[Lyon]] expecting to be safer there. Nevertheless, after the revolutionaries had taken the city he was captured and executed. This death was a great shock to Ampère.

In 1796 Ampère met Julie Carron, and in 1799 they were married. From about 1796, Ampère gave private lessons at Lyon in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and languages.  In 1801 he moved to [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], as professor of [[physics]] and chemistry, leaving his ailing wife and his infant son ([[Jean-Jacques Ampère]]) at Lyon. Her death, in July 1803, troubled Ampère for the rest of his life. Also in 1804, Ampère was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[University of Lyon]].

Ampère claimed that &quot;at eighteen years he found three culminating points in his life, his [[First Communion]], the reading of Antoine Leonard Thomas's &quot;Eulogy of Descartes&quot;, and the [[Taking of the Bastille]]. On the day of his wife's death he wrote two verses from the [[Psalm]]s, and the prayer, 'O Lord, God of Mercy, unite me in Heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth.' Serious doubts harassed him at times, and made him very unhappy. Then he would take refuge in the reading of the [[Bible]] and the [[Fathers of the Church]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01437c.htm| doi = | accessdate = 2007-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time he took into his family the young student [[Antoine-Frédéric Ozanam]] (1813-1853), one of the founders of the [[Conference of Charity]], later known as the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]]. Though Ampère, Ozanam had contact with leaders of the [[neo-Catholic]] movement, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], and [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]]. Ozanam was to be [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[1997]].

== Physics and further studies ==

[[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s recommendation obtained for Ampère the Lyon appointment, and afterwards (1805) a minor position in the polytechnic school at [[Paris]], where he was appointed professor of mathematics in 1809. Here Ampère continued to pursue his scientific research and his diverse studies with unabated diligence. He was admitted as a member of the Institute in 1814. 

Ampère's fame mainly rests on his establishing the relations between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], and in developing the science of [[electromagnetism]], or, as he called it, [[electrodynamics]].  On 11 September 1820 he heard of [[Hans Christian Ørsted|H. C. Ørsted's]] discovery that a [[Compass|magnetic needle]] is acted on by a voltaic current.  Only a week later, on 18 September, Ampère presented a paper to the Academy containing a much more complete exposition of that and kindred phenomena.  On the same day, Ampère also demonstrated before the Academy that parallel wires carrying currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether currents are in the same (attraction) or in opposite directions (repulsion). This laid the foundation of [[electrodynamics]].

The topic of [[electromagnetism]] thus begun, Ampère developed a mathematical theory which not only described the electromagnetic phenomena already observed, but also predicted many new ones.

During 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]].

== Last years ==

[[Image:Ampere grave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Ampère and his son]]

Ampère died at [[Marseille]] and was buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]], Paris. The great amiability and childlike simplicity of his character are well brought out in his ''Journal et correspondence'' (Paris, 1872).

Ampère's final work, published posthumously, was ''Essai sur la philosophie des sciences, ou exposition analytique d'une classification naturelle de toutes les connaissances humaines (&quot;Essay on the philosophy of science or analytical exposition on the natural classification of human knowledge&quot;)''.

&lt;!--THIS ARTICLE WAS STARTED IN BRITISH SPELLING. PLEASE KEEP PER WP:ENGVAR--&gt;
'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] (and so is covalently bonded) with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic [[pungent]] [[odour]]. Ammonia contributes significantly to the [[nutrition]]al needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to [[food]] and [[fertilizer]]s. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many [[pharmaceuticals]]. Although in wide use, ammonia is both [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] and [[hazard]]ous. In 2006, worldwide production was estimated at 146.5 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Appl |title=Ammonia, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year= 2006|publisher= Wiley-VCH|location= Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in commercial cleaning products.

Ammonia, as used commercially, is often called ''anhydrous ammonia.'' This term emphasizes the absence of water in the material. Because NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; boils at  -33.34 °C (-28.012 °F), the liquid must be stored under high pressure or at low temperature. Its [[Enthalpy of vaporization|heat of vapourization]] is, however, sufficiently high so that NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be readily handled in ordinary [[Beaker (glassware)|beakers]], in a [[fume hood]] (i.e., if it is already a liquid it will not boil readily). &quot;Household ammonia&quot; or &quot;[[ammonium hydroxide]]&quot; is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water. The strength of such solutions is measured in units of [[Baumé scale|baume]] ([[density]]), with 26 degrees baume (about 30% w/w ammonia at 15.5 °C) being the typical high concentration commercial product.&lt;ref name=LaRoche&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |title=Ammonium hydroxide physical properties}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household ammonia ranges in concentration from 5 to 10 weight percent ammonia.

==Structure and basic chemical properties==
The ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape with a bond angle of 107.8°, as predicted by the [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (VSEPR theory). The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs which are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5° as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but is measured at 107.8°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], which makes ammonia a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]]. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form [[hydrogen bonds]], makes ammonia highly miscible with [[Water (molecule)|water]]. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]]. Temperature and [[salinity]] also affect the proportion of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The latter has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[methane]]. It is known to have the highest [[specific heat capacity]] of any substance.

===Natural occurrence===
Ammonia is found in [[trace]] quantities in the atmosphere, being produced from the [[putrefaction]] (decay process) of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac), and [[ammonium sulfate]] are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]]n [[guano]]. The [[kidney]]s secrete NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to neutralize excess acid.&lt;ref&gt;ammonia is a purple gas.{{cite journal|pmid=10360635|year=1999|month=Jun|author=Kirschbaum, B; Sica, D; Anderson, Fp|title=Urine electrolytes and the urine anion and osmolar gaps.|volume=133|issue=6|pages=597–604|issn=0022-2143|journal=The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine|doi=10.1016/S0022-2143(99)90190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium salts also are found distributed through all fertile soil and in seawater. Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called ''ammoniacal''.
Ammonia is found on Pluto, Jupiter and, in small amounts, on Uranus.

==History==
[[File:Ammoniak Reaktor BASF.jpg|thumb|This high-pressure reactor was built in 1921 by [[BASF]] in [[Ludwigshafen]] and was re-erected on the premises of the [[University of Karlsruhe]] in Germany.]]
The Romans called the ammonium chloride deposits they collected from near the Temple of Jupiter [[Amun]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] Ἄμμων ''Ammon'') in [[ancient Libya]] 'sal ammoniacus' (salt of Amun) because of proximity to the nearby temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ammonia| work = h2g2 Eponyms|publisher = BBC.CO.UK|date = 2003-01-11|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A632990| accessdate = 2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salts of ammonia have been known from very early times; thus the term ''Hammoniacus sal'' appears in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} cites Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' xxxi. 39&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern ''sal-ammoniac''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mineral Data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Sal-ammoniac.shtml |title=Sal-ammoniac|publisher=Webmineral|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form of sal-ammoniac (nushadir), ammonia was important to the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Muslim alchemists]] as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Islamic chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Haq1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haq|first=Syed Nomanul|title=Names, Natures and Things: The Alchemist Jabir Ibn Hayyan and His Kitab Al-Ahjar (Book of Stones)|url=http://books.google.com/?id=P-70YjP0nj8C|accessdate=22 June 2010|date=1995-02-28|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-3254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the European [[Alchemy|alchemists]] since the 13th century, being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It was also used by [[dye]]rs in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]] to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the 15th century, [[Basilius Valentinus]] showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal-ammoniac. At a later period, when sal-ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with [[hydrochloric acid]], the name &quot;spirit of hartshorn&quot; was applied to ammonia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kwQQaltqByAC&amp;pg=PA72|page=72|title=Historical Studies in the Language of Chemistry|author=Maurice P. Crosland|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2004|isbn=0-486-43802-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1774 and was termed by him ''alkaline air''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy&quot; &gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham, Lyndy|title=Marvell and alchemy|publisher=Aldershot Scolar |year=1990|isbn=0-85967-774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 years later in 1785, [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] ascertained its composition.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The [[Haber-Bosch process]] to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] in 1909 and patented in 1910. It was first used on an industrial scale by the Germans during [[World War I]],&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from [[Chile]]. The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conquering&quot; &gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Roland|title=Conquering Chemistry|year=2001|isbn=0-07-470146-0|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the advent of cheap natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to [[ammonia production]] was produced via the [[electrolysis]] of water or using the [[chloralkali process]]. The [[Vemork]] 60 MW hydroelectric plant in Norway, constructed in 1911, was used purely for plants using the [[Birkeland-Eyde process]].

==Synthesis and production==
{{See also|Haber-Bosch process}}
Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of [[chemical plant]]s worldwide produce ammonia. The worldwide [[ammonia production]] in 2004 was 109&amp;nbsp;million [[metric tonnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-07-07|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/nitrogen/nitromcs05.pdf |title=United States Geological Survey publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Republic of China]] produced 28.4% of the worldwide production (increasingly from coal as part of [[urea]] synthesis)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2009-07-07|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3323/is_200401/ai_n8039172/|title=New coal-based ammonia and urea capacity.(China)|date=January 2004}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[India]] with 8.6%, [[Russia]] with 8.4%, and the [[United States]] with 8.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt; About 80% or more of the ammonia produced is used for fertilizing agricultural crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;/&gt;

Before the start of [[World War I]], most ammonia was obtained by the [[dry distillation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2009-07-07|url=http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1918/press.html |title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1918)] – [[Haber-Bosch process]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including [[camel]] [[manure|dung]], where it was [[distillation|distilled]] by the reduction of [[nitrous acid]] and [[nitrite]]s with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of [[coal]], and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by [[alkaline]] hydroxides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2009-07-07|title=Chemistry of the Group 2 Elements – Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1002934|publisher= BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], the salt most generally used being the chloride ([[ammonium chloride|sal-ammoniac]]) thus:

:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 2 CaO → CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Today, the typical modern ammonia-producing plant first converts [[natural gas]] (i.e., methane) or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (such gases are [[propane]] and [[butane]]) or petroleum [[naphtha]] into gaseous hydrogen. The process used in producing the hydrogen begins with removal of [[sulfur]] compounds from the natural gas (because sulfur deactivates the [[catalyst]]s used in subsequent steps). Catalytic [[hydrogenation]] converts organosulfur compounds into gaseous [[hydrogen sulfide]]:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + RSH → RH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (g)

The hydrogen sulfide is then removed by passing the gas through beds of [[zinc oxide]] where it is adsorbed and converted to solid [[zinc sulfide]]:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + ZnO → ZnS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Catalytic [[steam reforming]] of the sulfur-free feedstock is then used to form hydrogen plus [[carbon monoxide]]:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the next step, the [[water gas shift reaction]] is used to convert the [[carbon monoxide]] into [[carbon dioxide]] and more hydrogen:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The carbon dioxide is then removed either by absorption in aqueous [[ethanolamine]] solutions or by [[adsorption]] in [[Pressure Swing Adsorption|pressure swing adsorbers]] (PSA) using proprietary solid adsorption media.

The final step in producing the hydrogen is to use catalytic methanation to remove any small residual amounts of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide from the hydrogen:

:CO + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

To produce the desired end-product ammonia, the hydrogen is then reacted with nitrogen (derived from process air) using a [[magnetite]] [[catalyst]] under high pressure to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the [[Haber-Bosch]] process):

:3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification, less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives which are presently impractical for large scale.
At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at [[Vemork]], via the electrolysis route. Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.

==Biosynthesis==
[[File:Production of ammonia.svg|thumb|300px|Production trend of ammonia between 1947 and 2007]]
In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by [[enzyme]]s called [[nitrogenase]]s. The overall process is called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods will be developed that are competitive with the [[Haber process]], intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; ensemble.

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]]. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, birds, as well as insects and snails solely excrete [[uric acid]] as nitrogenous waste.

==Properties==
Ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is [[lighter than air]], its density being 0.589 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. It is easily liquefied due to the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules; the [[liquid]] boils at −33.3 °C, and freezes at −77.7 °C to white crystals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The crystal symmetry is cubic, [[Pearson symbol]] cP16, [[space group]] P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;3 No.198, lattice constant 0.5125&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0567739479001340|title=The crystal structure of deuteroammonia between 2 and 180 K by neutron powder profile refinement|year=1979|last1=Hewat|first1=A. W.|last2=Riekel|first2=C.|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=35|issue=4|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liquid]] ammonia possesses strong [[ion]]ising powers reflecting its high [[Dielectric constant|ε]] of 22. Liquid ammonia has a very high [[Enthalpy of vaporization|standard enthalpy change of vapourization]] (23.35&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/mol, ''cf.'' [[water (molecule)|water]] 40.65&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, methane 8.19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in non-insulated vessels without additional refrigeration.

It is [[miscible]] with water. Ammonia in an aqueous solution can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is often known as '.880 Ammonia'. Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15–25% air. When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if chlorine is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also formed.

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260&amp;nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleeton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.45.234|title=Electromagnetic Waves of {{convert|1.1|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Wave-Length and the Absorption Spectrum of Ammonia|year=1934|author=Cleeton, C. E.|journal=Physical Review|volume=45|issue=4|pages=234|first2=N. H.|last2=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or acetic acid. Both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt.

===Basicity===
One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its [[basicity]]. It combines with [[acid]]s to form [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. However, perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]]: moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baker, H. B. |year=1894|journal=J. Chem. Soc.|volume=65|page= 612}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the [[:Category:Ammonium compounds|ammonium salts]] and all contain the [[ammonium|ammonium ion]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Anhydrous ammonia is often used for the [[Methamphetamine abuse|production of methamphetamine]]. Dilute aqueous ammonia can be applied on the skin to lessen the effects of acidic animal poisons, such as from insects and [[jellyfish]].

===Acidity===
Although ammonia is well-known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of [[amide]]s (which contain the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion). For example, [[lithium]] dissolves into liquid ammonia to give a solution of [[lithium amide]]:

:2 Li + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Self-dissociation===
Like water, ammonia undergoes [[molecular autoionisation]] to form its acid and base conjugates:
:2 {{chem|NH|3}} (l) {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} (aq) + {{chem|NH|2|-}} (aq)
At standard pressure and temperature, [{{chem|NH|4|+}}][{{chem|NH|2|-}}] = 10{{su|p=−30}}&amp;nbsp;M{{su|p=2}}.

===Combustion===
The combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and [[water]] is [[exothermic]]:
: 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''g'') ([[Standard enthalpy of reaction|Δ''H''º&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]] = –1267.20 kJ/mol)

The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ''H''º&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is –382.81&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all [[nitrogen oxide]]s are unstable with respect to nitrogen and [[oxygen]], which is the principle behind the [[catalytic converter]]. However, nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of [[nitric acid]]:
:4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 NO + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

A subsequent reaction leads to water and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as [[platinum]] gauze), as the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia-air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of other compounds===
In [[organic chemistry]], ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting –NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as by-products. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]].

[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with a number of [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200 °C are required.

The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by [[metal]]s, thus [[magnesium]] burns in the gas with the formation of [[magnesium nitride]] Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and when the gas is passed over heated [[sodium]] or [[potassium]], sodamide, NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and potassamide, KNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are formed. Where necessary in [[IUPAC nomenclature|substitutive nomenclature]], [[IUPAC]] recommendations prefer the name '''azane''' to ammonia: hence [[chloramine]] would be named ''chloroazane'' in substitutive nomenclature, not ''chloroammonia''.

Pentavalent ammonia is known as λ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure, and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0373800|title=High pressure chemistry of hydrogenous fuels|author=Sterrett ,K.

===Ammonia as a ligand===
[[File:Tetraamminediaquacopper(II)-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the tetraamminediaquacopper(II) cation, [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
Ammonia can act as a [[ligand]] in [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]]. It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include:
*'''Tetraamminediaquacopper(II)''', [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a characteristic dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to solution of copper(II) salts. Known as [[Schweizer's reagent]].
*'''Diamminesilver(I)''', [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[silver chloride]] (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, [[silver bromide]] (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution while [[silver iodide]] (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous solution of ammonia.

Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s theory of coordination compounds. Werner noted that only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] could be formed, and concluded that the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This proposal has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.
:Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + HgCl(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments. The [NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] ratio has been estimated to range from 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; in small dark clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ungerechts, H., Walmsley, CM., Winnewisser, G.|journal=Astron.

All other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller, making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrochemistry.net |title=astrochemistry.net |publisher=astrochemistry.net |date= |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play, the reaction:

Some of the other possible formation reactions are:

This is due to the relatively high abundance of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Uses==
===Fertilizer===
Approximately 83% (as of 2004) of ammonia is used as fertilizers either as its salts or as solutions. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, the production of ammonia is a significant component of the world energy budget.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Precursor to nitrogenous compounds===
Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. An important derivative is [[nitric acid]]. This key material is generated via the [[Ostwald process]] by [[oxidation]] of ammonia with air over a [[platinum]] catalyst at 700–850 °C, ~9 atm. [[Nitric oxide]] is an intermediate in this conversion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. |title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|location= San Diego|year=2001|isbn=0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Nitric acid is used for the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and many organonitrogen compounds.

===Cleaner===
Household ammonia is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water (i.e., [[ammonium hydroxide]]) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration from 5 to 10 weight percent ammonia.

===Minor and emerging uses===
====Refrigeration – R717====
Because of its favourable vaporization properties, ammonia is an attractive [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] and low cost. The [[Kalina cycle]], which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia-water mixture. Ammonia is used less frequently in commercial applications, such as in grocery store freezer cases and refrigerated displays due to its toxicity.

====For remediation of gaseous emissions====
Ammonia is used to scrub SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR ([[selective catalytic reduction]]), relies on a [[vanadia]]-based catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-07-07|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_748642_page_3.htm |title=Diesel: Greener Than You Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a fuel====
[[File:AmmoniacalGasEngineStreetcarARWaud.jpeg|thumb|Drawing of an Ammoniacal Gas Engine Streetcar in New Orleans (1871) by Alfred Rudolph Waud]]
Ammonia was used during [[World War II]] to power buses in Belgium, and in engine and solar energy applications prior to 1900. Liquid ammonia was used as the fuel of the rocket airplane, the [[X-15]]. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.

Ammonia has been proposed as a practical alternative to [[fossil fuel]] for [[internal combustion engines]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-library/downloads/transportation|title=Ammonia as a Transportation Fuel IV|date=October 15–16, 2007|publisher=
Norm Olson –Iowa Energy Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calorific value of ammonia is 22.5 MJ/kg (9690 [[BTU]]/lb) which is about half that of diesel. In a normal engine, in which the water vapour is not condensed, the calorific value of ammonia will be about 21% less than this figure. It can be used in existing engines with only minor modifications to [[carburettors]]/[[injector]]s.

To meet these demands, significant capital would be required to increase present production levels. Although the second most produced chemical, the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage. It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. It is however significantly less efficient than batteries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The 60 MW Rjukan dam in [[Telemark]], Norway produced ammonia via electrolysis of water for many years from 1913 producing fertilizer for much of Europe. If produced from coal, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be readily sequestered &lt;ref name=c1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/ammoniaMtg07.htm |title=Iowa Energy Center, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency; Research, Education and Demonstration – Related Renewable Energy – Ammonia 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the combustion products are nitrogen and water). In 1981 a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0hBAz6MxC4 |title=YouTube – Ammonia Powered Car}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregvezina.com |title=Watch 'Ammonia Fuel'|accessdate=2009-07-07|publisher=Greg Vezina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a [[working fluid]], have been proposed and occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/ammonia/ammonia.htm |title=Ammonia Motors |date=1 October 2007 |publisher=aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is similar to that used in a [[fireless locomotive]], but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] in the UK and in [[streetcars in New Orleans]] in the USA.

====As a stimulant====

Ammonia has found significant use in various sports – particularly the strength sports of [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] and [[Olympic weightlifting]] as a respiratory stimulant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of [[Methamphetamine]] through a [[Birch reduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General &amp;#124; Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Birch method of making meth is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.

====Textile====
Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, give a properties like [[mercerisation]] using alkalies. In particular, it is used for pre-washing of wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=

====Lifting gas====
At standard temperature and pressure ammonia is lighter than air, and has approximately 60% of the lifting power of hydrogen or helium. Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a [[lifting gas]]. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).

====Woodworking====
Ammonia was historically used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts &amp; Crafts and Mission style furniture. Ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fuming_white_oak.html |title=Fuming white oak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ammonia's role in biological systems and human disease==
[[File:Symptoms of hyperammonemia.svg|thumb|250px|Main symptoms of hyperammonemia (ammonia reaching toxic concentrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/944996-overview |title=eMedicine Specialties &gt; Metabolic Diseases &gt; Hyperammonemia|author= Karl S Roth, MD. |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ammonia is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75% ), few living creatures are capable of using this nitrogen. Nitrogen is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing [[legume]]s, benefit from [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[rhizobia]] which create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adjei, M.B.; Quesenberry, K.H. and Chamblis, C.G.|title=Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AG152 |publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|date=June 2002}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. Ammonia is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=10323059 |title=PubChem Substance Summary|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]] as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zschocke, Johannes, and Georg Hoffman|title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Friedrichsdorf, Germany: Milupa GmbH|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rose, Burton, and Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1994|isbn=0-683-07354-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excretion===
{{Main|Excretion}}
Ammonium ions are a [[toxic]] waste product of the [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |coauthors=[[Jane Reece|Jane B. Reece]] |title=Biology |edition=6th |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=San Francisco, California |isbn=0-8053-6624-5 |pages=937–938 |chapter=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid ammonia as a solvent==
{{See also|Inorganic nonaqueous solvent}}
Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied non-aqueous ionising solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conducting solutions containing [[solvated electron]]s. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with those of water shows that NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, [[viscosity]], [[dielectric constant]] and [[electrical conductivity]]; this is due at least in part to the weaker H bonding in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the fact that such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks since each NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has only 1 lone-pair of electrons compared with 2 for each H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. The ionic self-[[dissociation constant]] of liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at −50 °C is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·L&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds including many [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[cyanide]]s and [[thiocyanate]]s. Most [[ammonium]] salts are soluble, and these salts act as acids in liquid ammonia solutions. The solubility of [[halide]] salts increases from [[fluoride]] to [[iodide]]. A saturated solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] contains 0.83&amp;nbsp;mol solute per mole of ammonia, and has a [[vapour pressure]] of less than 1&amp;nbsp;bar even at {{convert|25|C|0|abbr=on}}.

===Solutions of metals===
{{See also|Solvated electron}}
Liquid ammonia will dissolve the [[alkali metal]]s and other [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] metals such as [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. At low concentrations (&lt;0.06&amp;nbsp;mol/L), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and [[solvated electron]]s, free electrons which are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules.

These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as [[Wiktionary:immiscible|immiscible]] phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen, [[Standard electrode potential|''E''°]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{unicode|⇌}} 8NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is only +0.04&amp;nbsp;V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the [[Amide|metal amide]] and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions: although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

==Detection and determination==
Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the least trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. [[Sulfur sticks]] are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard [[sulfuric acid]] and the excess of acid then determined [[volumetric analysis|volumetrically]]; or the ammonia may be absorbed in [[hydrochloric acid]] and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]], (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Interstellar space===
Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on [[microwave]] emissions from the direction of the [[Milky Way|galactic core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cheung, A.C.; Rank, D.M.; Townes, C.H.; Thornton, D.D. and Welch, W.J.|year= 1968|title=Detection of NH3 molecules in the interstellar medium by their microwave emission|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=21|issue=25|page=1701|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.21.1701|bibcode=1968PhRvL..21.1701C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first [[polyatomic]] molecule to be so detected.
The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=ho&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ho, P. T. P. and Townes, C.H.|year= 1983|title=Interstellar ammonia|bibcode=1983ARA&amp;A..21..239H|journal=Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophys.|volume= 21|issue=1|pages=239–70|doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.21.090183.001323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium.

The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Deuterium|D]], NHD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The detection of triply [[deuterium|deuterated]] ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Millar, T. J.|title=Deuterium Fractionation in Interstellar Clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume= 106|issue=1|pages=73–86|doi=10.1023/A:1024677318645|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ammonia molecule has also been detected in the atmospheres of the [[gas giant]] planets, including [[Jupiter]], along with other gases like methane, hydrogen, and [[helium]]. The interior of Saturn may include frozen crystals of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Kirk Munsell. Image page credit Lunar and Planetary Institute. NASA. &quot;[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=166 NASA's Solar Exploration: Multimedia: Gallery: Gas Giant Interiors]&quot;. accessed April 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is naturally found on Deimos and Phobos - the moons of Mars.

Since its interstellar discovery, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium. With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles. Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia.

====Single antenna detections====
Radio observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope]] reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T.L., Downes, D., Bieging, J. |year=1979|journal= AAp|volume= 71|page= 275 |bibcode=1979A&amp;A....71..275W|title=Ammonia in Orion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25 m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in [[H II region]]s, HNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[maser]]s, H-H objects, and other objects associated with star formation. A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacDonald, G.H., Little, L.T., Brown, A.T., Riley, P.W., Matheson, D.N., Felli, M. |year=1981|journal= MNRAS|volume= 195|page= 387 |bibcode=1981MNRAS.195..387M|title=Detection of new ammonia sources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), [[Orion (constellation)|Orion A]], W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre. The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morris, M., Zuckerman, B., Palmer, P., Turner, B.E. |year=1973|journal= APJ|volume= 186|page= 501 |bibcode=1973ApJ...186..501M|doi=10.1086/152515|title=Interstellar ammonia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interferometric studies====
[[Very Large Array|VLA]] observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows reveal condensations of less than 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] in L1551, S140, and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus A]]. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Torrelles, J.M., Ho, P.T.P., Rodriguez, L.F., Canto, J. |year=1985|journal= APJ|volume= 288|page= 595 |bibcode=1985ApJ...288..595T|doi=10.1086/162825|title=VLA observations of ammonia and continuum in regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in [[IC 342]]. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ho, P.T.P., Martin, R.N.,Turner, J.L., Jackson, J. M. |year=1990|journal= APJL|volume= 355|page= L19 |bibcode=1990ApJ...355L..19H|doi=10.1086/185728|title=VLA imaging of extragalactic ammonia – Hot gas in the nucleus of IC 342}}&lt;/ref&gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was also monitored by VLA towards a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96-0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cesaroni, R., Churchwell, E., Hofner, P., Walmsley, C. M., Kurtz, S. |year=1994|journal= AAP|volume= 288|page= 903 |bibcode=1994A&amp;A...288..903C|title=Hot ammonia towards compact HII regions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infrared detections====
Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the [[Becklin-Neugebauer Object]] and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Knacke, R.F., Mc Corkle, S., Puetter, R.C., Erickson, E.F., Kraetschmer, W. |year=1982|journal= APJ|volume= 260|page= 141|bibcode=1982ApJ...260..141K|doi=10.1086/160241|title=Observation of interstellar ammonia ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]], covering the 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Orton, G.S., Aumann, H.H., Martonchik, J.V., Appleby, J.F. |year=1982|journal= Icarus|volume= 52|issue=1|page= 81 |bibcode=1982Icar...52...81O|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(82)90170-1|title=Airborne spectroscopy of Jupiter in the 100- to 300-cm−1 region: Global properties of ammonia gas and ice haze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The cores are not generally spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benson, P.J., Myers, P. |year=1989|journal= APJS|volume= 71|page= 89 |bibcode=1989ApJS...71...89B|doi=10.1086/191365|title=A survey for dense cores in dark clouds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia has been detected in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco Nebula]] and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic [[infrared cirrus]]. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo which could have been borne in the galactic disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mebold, U., Heithausen, A., Reif, K.|year= 1987|journal= AAP|volume= 180|page= 213|bibcode=1987A&amp;A...180..213M|title=Ammonia in the galactic halo and the infrared cirrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomical observations and research applications==
The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades. Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer.

===Observations of nearby dark clouds===
By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between [[excitation temperature]] and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines — indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dark clouds. Mapping of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.

===UC HII regions===
Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas which can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.

===Extragalactic detection===
Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies, and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (~50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy — hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).

==Safety precautions==
[[File:Ammiakoprovod NS.jpg|thumb|The world's longest ammonia [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], running from the [[TogliattiAzot]] plant in [[Russia]] to [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]].]]
The U. S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts126.pdf |title=Toxic FAQ Sheet for Ammonia| publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR)|date= September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/7664417.html Ammonia], IDLH Documentation&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet/&gt; Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/hm-permitting.htm#one Hazardous Materials (HM) Safety Permits] from the website of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicity and storage information===
The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to [[carbamoyl phosphate]] by the enzyme [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase]], and then enters the [[urea cycle]] to be either incorporated into [[amino acid]]s or excreted in the urine. However, [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is [[Directive 67/548/EEC|classified]] as ''dangerous for the environment''. Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with bases (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.

===Household use===
Solutions of ammonia (5–10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, or a poisonous gas may result. Mixing with [[chlorine]]-containing products or strong oxidants, for example household [[bleach]] can lead to hazardous compounds such as [[chloramine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Rizk-Ouaini|first =Rosette|last2 =Ferriol, Michel; Gazet, Josette; Saugier-Cohen Adad, Marie Therese |title = Oxidation reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite.

===Laboratory use of ammonia solutions===
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|Hydrochloric acid sample releasing HCl fumes, which are reacting with ammonia fumes to produce a white smoke of ammonium chloride.]]
The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: &quot;dilute&quot; ammonia solutions are usually 5–10% by weight (&lt;5.62&amp;nbsp;mol/L); &quot;concentrated&quot; solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a solution which has a lower density will be more concentrated. The [[Directive 67/548/EEC|European Union classification]] of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated (&quot;0.880&quot;) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care; this is not usually a problem for 25% (&quot;0.900&quot;) solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with [[halogen]]s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with [[silver (element)|silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[iodide]] salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in [[qualitative analysis|qualitative chemical analysis]], and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (&lt;6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.

===Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid)===
&lt;!-- EU index no. 007-001-00-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- R10, 23, 34, 50; S1/2, 9, 16, 26, 36/37/39, 45, 61 --&gt;
Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic ('''T''') and dangerous for the environment ('''N'''). The gas is flammable ([[autoignition temperature]]: 651 °C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the United States is 50&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] (35&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while the [[IDLH]] concentration is estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50&amp;nbsp;ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes [[copper (element)|copper]]- and [[zinc (element)|zinc]]-containing [[alloy]]s, and so [[brass]] fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack [[rubber]] and certain plastics.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens. [[Nitrogen triiodide]], a [[primary explosive|primary]] [[high explosive]], is formed when ammonia comes in contact with [[iodine]]. Ammonia causes the explosive [[polymerisation]] of [[ethylene oxide]]. It also forms explosive [[fulminating]] compounds with compounds of [[gold (element)|gold]], [[silver]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[germanium]] or [[tellurium]], and with [[stibine]]. Violent reactions have also been reported with [[acetaldehyde]], [[hypochlorite]] solutions, [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[peroxide]]s.

'''Amethyst''' is a violet variety of [[quartz]] often used in [[jewelry]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀ'' ''a-'' (&quot;not&quot;) and ''μέθυστος'' ''methustos'' (&quot;intoxicated&quot;), a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from [[drunkenness]]; the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] wore amethyst and made drinking vessels of it in the belief that it would prevent [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].

==Chemistry==
Amethyst is the violet variety of [[quartz]]; its chemical formula is SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the 19th century, the color of amethyst was attributed to the presence of [[manganese]]. However, since it is capable of being greatly altered and even discharged by heat, the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source. [[Iron|Ferric]] [[thiocyanate]] has been suggested, and [[sulfur]] was said to have been detected in the mineral.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The color in amethyst is due to [[irradiation]], which caused the iron ions present as impurities in quartz to rearrange themselves in the crystal lattice affecting the color in a reversible process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/pdf/mr/v12n3/v12n3a11.pdf ''Infrared and Chemical Characterization of Natural Amethysts and Prasiolites Colored by Irradiation''] Materials Research, Vol. 12, No. 3, 315-320,  8th may 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic amethyst is thus man-made by [[gamma-ray]], [[x-ray]] or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz which has been first doped with ferric impurities.

On exposure to heat, the irradiation effects can be partially cancelled and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green, and much of the [[citrine]], [[Cairngorm (mineral)|cairngorm]], or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely &quot;burnt amethyst&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Synthetic, imitation, and treated gemstones, Michael O'Donoghue'' pages 124 &amp; 125, Reed Elsevier publishing 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic amethyst is made to imitate the best quality amethyst. Its chemical and physical properties are so similar to that of natural amethyst that it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemnological testing (which is often cost-prohibitive). There is one test based on &quot;Brazil law twinning&quot; (a form of [[Crystal twinning|quartz twinning]] where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://quartzpage.de/crs_twins.html|title = Quartz Page Twinning Crystals|accessdate = 2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which can be used to identify synthetic amethyst rather easily. It is possible to synthesize twinned amethyst, but this type is not available in large quantities in the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;WiseSecrets1&quot;/&gt;

==Composition==
Amethyst is composed of an irregular superposition of alternate [[lamellar structure|lamellae]] of right-handed and left-handed quartz. It has been shown that this structure may be due to mechanical stresses.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Because it has a hardness of seven on the [[Mohs scale of hardness|Mohs scale]], amethyst is suitable for use in jewelry.

==Hue and tone==
Amethyst occurs in primary hues from a light pinkish violet to a deep purple. Amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues, red and blue. The ideal grade is called &quot;Deep Siberian&quot; and has a primary purple hue of around 75–80%, 15–20% blue and (depending on the light source) red secondary hues.&lt;ref name=&quot;WiseSecrets1&quot;&gt;''Secrets of the Gem Trade; The Connoisseur's Guide to Precious Gemstones'' Richard W Wise, Brunswick House Press, Lenox, Massachutes., 2005 ISBN 0-9728223-8-0&lt;/ref&gt; Green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green amethyst, which is an actual misnomer and not an acceptable name for the material, the proper terminology being prasiolite. It is actually against FTC Guidelines to call prasiolite ''green amethyst''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Other names for green quartz are pvermarine, greened amethyst, or lime citrine.

Of very variable intensity, the color of amethyst is often laid out in stripes parallel to the final faces of the crystal. The fact that sometimes only a thin surface layer of violet color be presents in the stone or that this color is not homogeneous, makes often a difficult cutting. The art of lapidary is to place the color correctly in order to make homogeneous the tone of cut stones.

==History==
[[File:Intaglio Caracalla Cdm Paris Chab2101.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[engraved gem]] of [[Caracalla]] in amethyst, once in the Treasury of [[Sainte-Chapelle]].]]
Amethyst was used as a [[gemstone]] by the ancient [[Egypt]]ians and was largely employed in antiquity for [[intaglio (jewelry)|intaglio engraved gems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;castellani&quot;&gt;''Gems, Notes and Extracts'' Augosto Castellani (famous Italian 19th century jeweler), page 34, London, Bell and Daldy, 1871 ISBN 1-141-06174-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication,&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=czU2nSOaKioC&amp;ots=TBsozlzp7T ''Diamonds, Pearls and Precious Stones''] Marcell N Smith, Griffith Stillings Press, Boston, Massachutes., 1913, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; while medieval European soldiers wore amethyst [[amulets]] as protection in battle – the reason for this being that amethysts are believed to heal people and keep them cool-headed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Beads of amethyst were found in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] graves in England.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

A large [[geode]], or &quot;amethyst-grotto&quot;, from near Santa Cruz in southern [[Brazil]] was presented at the 1902 exhibition in [[Düsseldorf, Germany]].

Amethyst is the traditional [[birthstone]] for February.

===Mythology===
The Greek word &quot;amethystos&quot; may be translated as &quot;not drunken&quot;, from Greek ''a-'', not + ''methustos'', intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness, which is why wine goblets were often carved from it. In Greek mythology, [[Dionysus]], the god of intoxication, and of wine, was pursuing a maiden named Amethystos, who refused his affections. Amethystos prayed to the gods to remain chaste, a prayer which the goddess [[Artemis]] answered, transforming her into a white stone. Humbled by Amethystos's desire to remain chaste, Dionysus poured wine over the stone as an offering, dyeing the crystals purple.

Variations of the story include that Dionysus had been insulted by a mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path, creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath. The mortal turned out to be a beautiful young woman, Amethystos, who was on her way to pay tribute to [[Artemis]]. Her life was spared by Artemis, who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws. Dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue. The god's tears then stained the quartz purple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/amethyst.html The amethyst] Gemstone.org&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation involves the titan [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] presenting Dionysus with the amethyst stone to preserve the wine-drinker's sanity.&lt;ref&gt;(Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca,'' XII.380)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Quartz-119178.jpg|thumb|An amethyst cluster from [[Artigas, Uruguay]]. Size: 15.9×15.6×10.6 cm.]]
Amethyst is produced in abundance from the state of [[Minas Gerais]] in [[Brazil]] where it occurs in large [[geode]]s within [[volcanic rock]]s. Many of the hollow agates of southwestern [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior. [[Artigas, Uruguay]] and neighboring Brazilian state [[Rio Grande do Sul]] are large world producers exceeding in quantity [[Minas Gerais]], as well as [[Mato Grosso]], [[Espirito Santo]], [[Bahia]], and [[Ceará]] states, all amethyst producers of importance in Brazil.

It is also found and mined in [[South Korea]]. The largest opencast amethyst vein in the world is in [[Maissau]], Lower [[Austria]]. Much fine amethyst comes from [[Russia]], especially from near [[Mursinka]] in the [[Ekaterinburg]] district, where it occurs in [[Druse (geology)|drusy]] cavities in granitic rocks. Many localities in south [[India]] yield amethyst. One of the largest global amethyst producers is [[Zambia]] in southern [[Africa]] with an annual production of about 1000 tonnes.

Amethyst occurs at many localities in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Among these may be mentioned: the [[Mazatzal Mountain]] region in [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila]] and [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa Counties]], [[Arizona]]; [[Amethyst Mountain]], [[Texas]]; [[Yellowstone National Park]]; [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]]; [[Haywood County, North Carolina]]; Deer Hill and Stow, [[Maine]] and in the [[Lake Superior]] region of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], and [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]]. Amethyst is relatively common in [[Ontario]], and in various locations throughout [[Nova Scotia]]. The largest amethyst mine in [[North America]] is located in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario.

==Value==
Up until the 18th century, amethyst was included in the [[Cardinal gem|cardinal]], or most valuable, gemstones (along with [[diamond]], [[sapphire]], [[ruby]], and [[emerald]]). However, since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as [[Brazil]], it has lost most of its value.

Collectors look for depth of color, possibly with red flashes if cut conventionally.&lt;ref&gt;CIBJO guidelines,&lt;/ref&gt; The highest grade amethyst (called &quot;Deep Russian&quot;) is exceptionally rare and therefore, when one is found, its value is dependent on the demand of collectors. It is, however, still orders of magnitude lower than the highest grade sapphires or rubies (padparadscha sapphire or &quot;pigeon's blood&quot; ruby).&lt;ref name=WiseSecrets1/&gt;

'''''Albertosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|l|ˌ|b|ɜr|t|ɵ|ˈ|s|ɔr|ə|s}}; meaning &quot;Alberta lizard&quot;) is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in western [[North America]] during the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], more than 70&amp;nbsp;[[million years ago]]. The [[type species]], ''A. sarcophagus'', was apparently restricted in [[range (biology)|range]] to the modern-day [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]], after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing ''[[Gorgosaurus libratus]]'' as a second species.

As a tyrannosaurid, ''Albertosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predator]] with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the [[food chain]] in its local [[ecosystem]]. Although relatively large for a theropod, ''Albertosaurus'' was much smaller than its more famous relative ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', probably weighing less than 2&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s.

Since the first discovery in 1884, [[fossil]]s of more than thirty individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of ''Albertosaurus'' anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 22 individuals at one site provides evidence of [[pack hunter|pack]] behaviour and allows studies of [[ontogeny]] and [[population biology]] which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.

==Description==
[[Image:Albertosaurus.png|thumb|left|''Albertosaurus'' with a human for scale]]
''Albertosaurus'' was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' and ''Tyrannosaurus''.

All tyrannosaurids, including ''Albertosaurus'', shared a similar body appearance. Typically for a theropod, ''Albertosaurus'' was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and [[torso]] with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot. The first digit, called the [[hallux]], was short and only the other three contacted the ground, with the third (middle) digit longer than the rest.&lt;ref name=holtz2004/&gt; ''Albertosaurus'' may have been able to reach speeds of 14−21&amp;nbsp;kilometres per hour (8−13&amp;nbsp;miles per hour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thulborn  |first1= Richard A. |year=1982 |title= Speeds and gaits of dinosaurs |journal= Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=38 |issue= 3-4  |pages=227−256 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(82)90005-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skull and teeth===
[[Image:Albertosaurus sarcophagus copia.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction]]
The massive [[skull]] of ''Albertosaurus'', perched on a short, ''S''-shaped neck, was approximately 1&amp;nbsp;metre (3.3&amp;nbsp;ft) long in the largest adults.&lt;ref name=currie2003a&gt;{{cite_journal|last=Currie |first=Philip J. |authorlink=Philip J.

Its long jaws contained more than 60 banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth. Unlike most theropods, ''Albertosaurus'' and other tyrannosaurids were [[heterodont]], with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The [[premaxilla]]ry teeth at the tip of the upper jaw were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and ''D''-shaped in [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]].&lt;ref name=holtz2004/&gt; Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ageofdinosaursalbertosaurus&quot;&gt;&quot;Albertosaurus.&quot; In: Dodson, Peter; Britt, Brooks; Carpenter, Kenneth; Forster, Catherine A.; Gillette, David D.; Norell, Mark A.; Olshevsky, George; Parrish, J. Michael; &amp; Weishampel, David B. ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Lincolnwood, IL: Publications International, Ltd., 1993. pp. 106-107. ISBN 0-7853-0443-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William L. Abler]] observed in 2001 that ''Albertosaurus'' [[tooth serrations]] are so thin as to functionally be a [[Fracture|crack]] in the tooth.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot;&gt;Abler, W.L. 2001. A kerf-and-drill model of tyrannosaur tooth serrations. p. 84-89. In: ''Mesozioc Vertebrate Life''. Ed.s Tanke, D. H., Carpenter, K., Skrepnick, M. W. Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the base of this crack is a round void called an ampulla which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger [[surface area]], hindering the ability of the &quot;crack&quot; formed by the serration to propagate through the tooth.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; An examination of other ancient predators, a [[phytosaur]] and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' found similarly crack-like serrations, but no [[adaptation]]s for preventing crack propagation.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; [[Tyrannosaurid]] teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling [[meat]] off a body, rather than [[knife]]-like cutting functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviours may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; When a tyrannosaur would have pulled back on a piece of meat, the force would tend to push the tip of tooth toward the front of the mouth and the anchored [[Tooth root|root]] would experience tension on the posterior side and compression from the front.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; This would typically incline the tooth to crack formation on the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] side of the tooth, but the ampullae at the base of the already crack-like serrations would tend to diffuse potential crack-forming forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; This form resembles techniques used by [[guitar]] makers to &quot;impart alternating regions of flexibility and ridgidity to a stick of wood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; The use of a [[drill]] to create an &quot;ampulla&quot; of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through an important material is also used to protect [[airplane]] surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt; Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with kerfs and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;abler-2001&quot; /&gt;

Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg ([[tibia]]) and feet ([[metatarsal]]s and [[phalanges]]).&lt;ref name=currie2003a/&gt;&lt;ref name=currieetal2003/&gt;

==Discovery and naming==
===Naming===
''Albertosaurus'' was named by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of ''Tyrannosaurus rex''.&lt;ref name=osborn1905&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry F. |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |year=1905 |title=Tyrannosaurus and other Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=21 |pages=259–265 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/1464}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|265}} The name honours [[Alberta]], the present-day [[Canadian province]] in which the first remains were found. The generic name also incorporates the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''σαυρος''/''sauros'' (&quot;lizard&quot;), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The type species is ''A. sarcophagus'', which means &quot;flesh-eater&quot; and has the same [[etymology]] as the [[sarcophagus|funeral container]] with which it shares its name: a combination of the Ancient Greek words ''σαρξ''/''sarx'' (&quot;flesh&quot;) and ''Φαγειν''/''phagein'' (&quot;to eat&quot;).&lt;ref name=osborn1905/&gt; More than thirty specimens of all ages are known to science.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=currie2003b/&gt;

===Early discoveries===
[[Image:red deer river.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Red Deer River]] near [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]]. Almost three-quarters of all ''Albertosaurus'' remains have been discovered alongside the river, in outcrops like the ones on either side of this picture.]]
The [[type specimen]] is a partial skull, collected in 1884 from an [[outcrop]] of the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] alongside the [[Red Deer River]], in present-day Alberta. This specimen and a smaller skull associated with some skeletal material were recovered by expeditions of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], led by the famous [[geologist]] [[Joseph Tyrrell|Joseph B. Tyrrell]]. The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species ''Laelaps incrassatus'' by [[Edward Drinker Cope]] in 1892,&lt;ref name=cope1892&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Cope |first=Edward D. |authorlink=Edward Drinker Cope |year=1892 |title=On the skull of the dinosaurian ''Laelaps incrassatus'' Cope |journal=American Philosophical Society, Proceedings |volume=30 |pages=240–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the name ''Laelaps'' was [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|preoccupied]] by a genus of [[mite]] and had been changed to ''[[Dryptosaurus]]'' in 1877 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh, so it fell to [[Lawrence Lambe]] to change ''Laelaps incrassatus'' to ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' when he described the remains in detail in 1904.&lt;ref name=lambe1904&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1904 |title=On ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' (Cope) from the Edmonton Series of the Northwest Territory |journal=Contributions to Canadian Palaeontology |volume=3 |pages=1–27|url=http://www.archive.org/details/LambeL.M.1904.OnDryptosaurusIncrassatuscopeFromTheEdmonton |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that ''D. incrassatus'' was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of ''D. aquilunguis'', type species of ''Dryptosaurus'', so Osborn created the new name ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before.&lt;ref name=osborn1905/&gt; Both specimens (CMN 5600 and 5601) are stored in the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] in [[Ottawa]].

===Dry Island bonebed===
In 1910, American paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] uncovered the remains of a large group of ''Albertosaurus'' at another [[quarry]] alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals they could identify in the [[bonebed]]. Among the bones deposited in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] collections in [[New York City]] are seven sets of right [[metatarsal]]s, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. The [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside [[Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park]].&lt;ref name=currie1998&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |authorlink=Philip J. Currie|year=1998 |title=Possible evidence of gregarious behavior in tyrannosaurids |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=271–277 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/21.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-03}} (not printed until 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remains of 13 more individuals of various ages, including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old individual estimated at over 10&amp;nbsp;metres (33&amp;nbsp;ft) in length. None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by remains in both museums.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2004/&gt;

===''Gorgosaurus libratus''===
[[Image:Gorgosaurus death pose.jpg|thumb|Sub-adult ''Gorgosaurus'' specimen in &quot;[[death pose]]&quot;, [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]]]] 
In 1913, [[paleontologist]] [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]] recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur ''[[Gorgosaurus]] libratus'' in 1914.&lt;ref name=lambe1914&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1914 |title=On a new genus and species of carnivorous dinosaur from the Belly River Formation of Alberta, with a description of the skull of ''Stephanosaurus marginatus'' from the same horizon |journal=Ottawa Naturalist |volume=28 |pages=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of [[Montana]]. Finding few differences to separate the two genera, [[Dale Russell]] declared the name ''Gorgosaurus'' a [[junior synonym]] of ''Albertosaurus'', which had been named first, and ''G. libratus'' was renamed ''Albertosaurus libratus'' in 1970. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus ''Albertosaurus'' backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.&lt;ref name=russell1970/&gt;

In 2003, [[Philip J. Currie]] compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are [[sister taxa]], more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' be retained as separate genera, as they are no more similar than ''Daspletosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from [[Alaska]] and [[New Mexico]], and Currie suggested that the ''Albertosaurus''-''Gorgosaurus'' situation may be clarified once these are described fully.&lt;ref name=currie2003b/&gt; Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation,&lt;ref name=holtz2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=ricklefs2007&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Ricklefs |first=Robert E. |year=2007 |title=Tyrannosaur ageing |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=214–217 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597 |pmid=17284406 |pmc=2375931}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some have not.&lt;ref name=carretal2005/&gt;

===Other discoveries===
[[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]] described a new species, ''Albertosaurus arctunguis'', based on a partial skeleton excavated near the Red Deer River in 1928,&lt;ref name=parks1928&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Parks |first=William A. |authorlink=William Parks (paleontologist)|year=1928 |title=''Albertosaurus arctunguis'', a new species of therapodous dinosaur from the Edmonton Formation of Alberta |journal=University of Toronto Studies, Geological Series |volume=25 |pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this species has been considered identical to ''A. sarcophagus'' since 1970.&lt;ref name=russell1970/&gt; Parks' specimen (ROM 807) is housed in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto]]. Six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and [[Wyoming]], but these probably do not represent ''A. sarcophagus'' and may not even belong to the genus ''Albertosaurus''.&lt;ref name=holtz2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=currie2003b/&gt;

''Albertosaurus megagracilis'' was based on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of Montana.&lt;ref name=paul1988&gt;{{cite_book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S. Paul |year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-61946-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed ''[[Dinotyrannus]]'' in 1995,&lt;ref name=olshevsky1995&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Olshevsky |first=George. |authorlink=George Olshevsky |year=1995 |title=(The origin and evolution of the tyrannosaurids.) |journal=Kyoryugaku Saizensen (Dino Frontline) |volume=9 |pages=92–119 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now thought to represent a juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus rex''.&lt;ref name=currie2003a/&gt;

==Paleobiology==
===Growth pattern===
[[Image:Tyrantgraph.png|thumb|right|A graph showing the hypothesized growth curves (body mass versus age) of four tyrannosaurids, with ''Albertosaurus'' drawn in &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2004/&gt;]]
Most age categories of ''Albertosaurus'' are represented in the [[fossil record]]. Using bone [[histology]], the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known ''Albertosaurus'' is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50&amp;nbsp;kilograms (110&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) and measured slightly more than 2&amp;nbsp;metres (7&amp;nbsp;ft) in length. The 10&amp;nbsp;metre (33&amp;nbsp;ft) specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an ''S''-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was 122&amp;nbsp;kilograms (268&amp;nbsp;lb) per year, based on an adult 1.3&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s (1.4&amp;nbsp;[[short ton]]s). Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern. Tyrannosaurids similar in size to ''Albertosaurus'' had similar growth rates, although the much larger ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' grew almost five times faster (601&amp;nbsp;kilograms [1325&amp;nbsp;lb] per year) at its peak.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt; The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of [[sexual maturity]] in ''Albertosaurus'', although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2004/&gt; Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2007&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Erickson |first=Gregory M. |coauthors= Curry Rogers, Kristi; Varricchio, David J.; Norell, Mark.; &amp; Xu, Xing |year=2007 |title=Growth patterns in brooding dinosaurs reveals the timing of sexual maturity in non-avian dinosaurs and genesis of the avian condition |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |pages=558–561 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0254 |pmid=17638674 |issue=5 |pmc=2396186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large&lt;ref name=lee_werning2008&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Lee |first=Andrew H. |coauthors= Werning, Sarah |year=2008 |title=Sexual maturity in growing dinosaurs does not fit reptilian growth models |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |pages=582–587 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708903105 |pmid=18195356 |issue=2 |pmc=2206579}}&lt;/ref&gt; dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and [[elephant]]s.&lt;ref name=lee_werning2008/&gt;  This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.&lt;ref name=ricklefs2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee_werning2008/&gt;

===Life history===
Most known ''Albertosaurus'' individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly [[preservation bias]], where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field.&lt;ref name=roachbrinkman2007&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Roach |first= Brian T. |coauthors=&amp; Brinkman, Daniel T. |year=2007 |title=A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs |journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–138 |doi=10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young ''Albertosaurus'' are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of [[Biological life cycle|life history]], rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile ''Albertosaurus'' are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;

A hypothesis of ''Albertosaurus'' life history postulates that [[hatchling]]s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult ''Albertosaurus'', and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to high physiological demands, stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of [[senescence]]. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, [[African buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all ''Albertosaurus'' specimens are known from one locality.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ricklefs2007/&gt;

In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of [[tyrannosaurid]] dinosaurs such as ''Albertosaurus'' were caused by a parasite similar to ''[[Trichomonas]] gallinae'' which infects birds.&lt;ref name=Wolff2009&gt;{{cite journal| year = 2009| author = Wolff, Ewan D. S.; Salisbury, Steven W.; Horner, John R.; &amp; Varricchio, David J.| editor1-last = Hansen| editor1-first = Dennis Marinus| title = Common avian infection plagued the tyrant dinosaurs| journal = PLoS ONE| pmid = 19789646| volume = 4 | issue = 9| pmc = 2748709| pages = e7288| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.&lt;ref name=Wolff2009/&gt;

===Pack behaviour===
[[Image:Albertosaurus.jpg|thumb|''Albertosaurus'' models, [[Royal Tyrell Museum]].]] 
The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 22 ''Albertosaurus'', the most individuals found in one locality of any Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' assemblage at the [[Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Utah]]. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;

The near-absence of [[herbivore]] remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[California]], and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;currie1998&quot;/&gt; Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.&lt;ref name=ericksonetal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=roachbrinkman2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=eberthmccrea2001&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Eberth |first=David A. |coauthors=&amp; McCrea, Richard T. |year=2001 |title=Were large theropods gregarious? |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=21 |issue=Supplement to 3 - Abstracts of Papers, 61st Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |page=46A}}(published abstract only)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs, including [[ceratopsia]]ns and [[hadrosaur]]s.&lt;ref name=horner1997&gt;{{cite_book |last=Horner |first=John R. |authorlink=Jack Horner (paleontologist) |year=1997 |chapter=Behavior |editor=[[Philip J.

Small theropods like ''[[Deinonychus]]'',&lt;ref name=maxwellostrom1995&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1995.10011256 |last=Maxwell |first=W.

Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside &quot;Sue,&quot; the ''Tyrannosaurus'' mounted in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]], and a bonebed in the [[Two Medicine Formation]] of Montana contains at least three specimens of ''Daspletosaurus'', preserved alongside several hadrosaurs.&lt;ref name=currieetal2005&gt;{{cite_book |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |authorlink=Philip J.

Currie also offers speculation on the pack-hunting habits of ''Albertosaurus''. The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of [[ornithomimid]]s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger ''Albertosaurus'' were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower.&lt;ref name=currie1998/&gt; Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator [[Ecological niche|niche]]s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than adult ''Albertosaurus'' in mass.&lt;ref name=holtz2004/&gt; A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small [[insectivore]]s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands.&lt;ref name=auffenberg1981&gt;{{cite_book |last=Auffenberg |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Auffenberg|year=2000 |title=The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=978-0-8130-0621-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested.

==Paleoecology==
[[Image:Horseshoe Canyon.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] is exposed in its [[Type locality (geology)|type section]] at [[Horseshoe Canyon (Alberta)|Horseshoe Canyon]], [[Alberta]].]]
All identifiable fossils of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' are known from the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] in Alberta. This [[geologic formation]] dates to the early [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period, 73 to 70 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the [[Bearpaw Shale]], a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] formation representing a section of the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon times before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like [[lagoon]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[tidal flat]]s. Numerous [[coal]] seams represent ancient [[peat]] [[swamp]]s. Like most of the other [[vertebrate]] fossils from the formation, ''Albertosaurus'' remains are found in deposits laid down in the [[river delta|deltas]] and [[floodplain]]s of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.&lt;ref name=eberth1997&gt;{{cite_book |last=Eberth |first=David A. |year=1997 |chapter=Edmonton Group |editor=[[Philip J. Currie|Currie, Philip J.]] &amp; Padian, Kevin (eds.) |title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs |publisher= Academic Press |location=San Diego |pages=199–204 |isbn=0-12-226810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fauna]] of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. [[Shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[sturgeon]]s, [[bowfin]]s, [[gar]]s and the gar-like ''[[Aspidorhynchus]]'' made up the fish fauna. Mammals included [[multituberculate]]s and the [[marsupial]] ''[[Didelphodon]]''. The saltwater [[plesiosaur]] ''[[Leurospondylus]]'' has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by [[turtle]]s, ''[[Champsosaurus]]'', and [[crocodilia]]ns like ''[[Leidyosuchus]]'' and ''[[Stangerochampsa]]''. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''[[Saurolophus]]'' and ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]''. Ceratopsians and [[ornithomimid]]s were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer [[ankylosauria]]ns and [[pachycephalosaur]]s, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including [[troodontid]]s, [[dromaeosaurid]]s, and [[caenagnathid]]s. Adult ''Albertosaurus'' were the [[apex predator]]s in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.&lt;ref name=eberth1997/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''See the [[#Related terminology|terminology]] section below for information regarding inconsistent use of the terms assembly and assembler.''

An '''assembly language''' is a [[low-level programming language]] for [[computer]]s, [[microprocessor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and other programmable devices. It implements a symbolic representation of the [[machine code]]s and other constants needed to program a given [[CPU]] architecture. This representation is usually defined by the hardware manufacturer, and is based on [[mnemonic#Assembly mnemonics|mnemonics]] that symbolize processing steps ([[instruction (computer science)|instructions]]), [[processor register]]s, memory locations, and other language features. An assembly language is thus specific to a certain physical (or virtual) computer architecture. This is in contrast to most [[high-level programming language]]s, which, ideally, are [[porting|portable]].

A [[utility program]] called an ''assembler'' is used to translate assembly language statements into the target computer's machine code. The assembler performs a more or less [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] translation (a one-to-one mapping) from [[mnemonic]] statements into machine instructions and data. This is in contrast with high-level languages, in which a single statement generally results in many machine instructions.

Many sophisticated assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, control the assembly process, and aid [[debugging]]. In particular, most modern assemblers include a [[macro (computer science)|macro]] facility (described below), and are called ''macro assemblers''.

==Key concepts==
===Why use an assembly language?===
A simple assembler converts each assembly language statement into the corresponding machine-language statement, so at first glance seems merely a minor convenience, substituting obscure machine instructions by easily remembered names. However, consider a machine-language program loaded into memory from location 0, which has an instruction which is the machine-code equivalent of &lt;code&gt;jump to instruction 25&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;jump forward skipping 5 instructions&lt;/code&gt;, followed by other instructions. If written in assembly language, assembled, and loaded it will produce exactly the same code, although it will have convenient [[mnemonic]]s and use symbolic labels rather than absolute locations, as in &lt;code&gt;jumpto label4&lt;/code&gt;, instead of something like hexadecimal number &lt;code&gt;A13528CD&lt;/code&gt;, the machine code for the instruction. However, if the program is modified in a way which changes the number of instructions, the destination of the jump may no longer be at location 25 or 5 instructions ahead, meaning the entire machine-language program must be modified every time such a change is made; to correct all jump destinations. If symbols have been used in an assembly language to identify the destination of the jump, the programmer need only work on the changed parts with no regard to anything else; the assembler will assemble the modified program with all jumps and so on adjusted to remain correct. Similarly, if memory availability requires the program to be loaded starting at location 123 instead of 0, the assembler will adjust all references to suit. Assembly language has many more such advantages over machine language.

===Assembler===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Computer software]] --&gt;
:''Compare with: [[Microassembler]].''
Typically a modern '''assembler''' creates [[object code]] by translating assembly instruction mnemonics into [[opcode]]s, and by resolving [[identifier|symbolic names]] for memory locations and other entities.&lt;ref&gt;David Salomon (1993). ''[http://www.davidsalomon.name/assem.advertis/asl.pdf Assemblers and Loaders]''&lt;/ref&gt; The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] facilities for performing textual substitution&amp;mdash;e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as [[inline expansion|inline]], instead of ''called'' [[subroutine]]s.

Assemblers are generally simpler to write than [[compiler]]s for [[high-level language]]s, and have been available since the 1950s. Modern assemblers, especially for [[RISC]] [[Instruction set architecture|architectures]], such as [[SPARC]] or [[IBM POWER|POWER]], as well as [[x86]] and [[x86-64]], optimize [[Instruction scheduling]] to exploit the [[CPU pipeline]] efficiently.

====Number of passes====

There are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed to produce the executable program.
* One-pass assemblers go through the source code once and assume that all symbols will be defined before any instruction that references them.
* Two-pass assemblers create a table with all symbols and their values in the first pass, then use the table in a second pass to generate code. The assembler must at least be able to determine the length of each instruction on the first pass so that the addresses of symbols can be calculated.

The original reason for the use of one-pass assemblers was speed; however, modern computers perform two-pass assembly without unacceptable delay.  The advantage of the two-pass assembler is that symbols can be defined anywhere in program source code, allowing programs to be defined in more logical and meaningful ways, making two-pass assembler programs easier to read and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Leland L.|title=System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1996|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-level assemblers====

More sophisticated [[high-level assembler]]s provide language abstractions such as:
* Advanced control structures
* High-level procedure/function declarations and invocations
* High-level abstract data types, including structures/records, unions, classes, and sets
* Sophisticated macro processing (although available on ordinary assemblers since late 1950s for [[IBM 700/7000 series|IBM 700 series]] and since 1960's for [[IBM/360]], amongst other machines)
* [[Object-oriented programming]] features such as [[class (object-oriented programming)|classes]], [[Object (computer science)|objects]], [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[type polymorphism|polymorphism]], and [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Randall. &quot;Chapter 12 - Classes and Objects&quot;. The Art of Assembly Language, 2nd Edition. No Starch Press. © 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[#Language design|Language design]] below for more details.

====Use of the term====

Note that, in normal professional usage, the term ''assembler'' is used to refer both to an assembly language, and to software which assembles an assembly-language program. Thus: &quot;CP/CMS was written in [[IBM System/360|S/360]] assembler&quot; as well as &quot;ASM-H was a widely-used [[IBM System/370|S/370]] assembler.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Assembly language===
A program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic statements and meta-statements (known variously as directives, pseudo-instructions and pseudo-ops), comments and data. These are translated by an [[assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] to a stream of executable instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed. Assemblers can also be used to produce blocks of data from formatted and commented source code, to be used by other code.

Take, for example, the instruction that tells an [[x86]]/[[IA-32]] processor to move an [[Constant (programming)|immediate 8-bit value]] into a [[processor register|register]]. The binary code for this instruction is 10110 followed by a 3-bit identifier for which register to use. The identifier for the ''AL'' register is 000, so the following [[machine code]] loads the ''AL'' register with the data 01100001.&lt;ref name=&quot;intel-1999-MOV&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2: Instruction Set Reference|year=1999|publisher=INTEL CORPORATION |pages=442 and 35|url=http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumII/manuals/24319102.PDF|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 10110000 01100001
This binary computer code can be made more human-readable by expressing it in [[hexadecimal]] as follows
 B0 61
Here, &lt;code&gt;B0&lt;/code&gt; means 'Move a copy of the following value into ''AL''', and &lt;code&gt;61&lt;/code&gt; is a hexadecimal representation of the value 01100001, which is 97 in [[decimal]]. Intel assembly language provides the [[mnemonic]] [[MOV (x86 instruction)|MOV]] (an abbreviation of ''move'') for instructions such as this, so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language, complete with an explanatory comment if required, after the semicolon. This is much easier to read and to remember.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;MOV AL, 61h       ; Load AL with 97 decimal (61 hex)&lt;/source&gt;

At one time many assembly language mnemonics were three letter abbreviations, such as JMP for ''jump'', INC for ''increment'', etc. Modern processors have a much larger instruction set and many mnemonics are now longer, for example FPATAN for &quot;''[[floating point]] partial [[Inverse trigonometric functions|arctangent]]''&quot; and BOUND for &quot;''check [[Array data structure|array]] [[Index (information technology)|index]] against [[Bounds checking|bounds]]''&quot;. Many assembly language statements consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by a comma-separated list of data, arguments or parameters.&lt;ref name=&quot;intel-1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2: Instruction Set Reference|year=1999|publisher=INTEL CORPORATION |url=http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumII/manuals/24319102.PDF|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same mnemonic MOV refers to a family of related opcodes to do with loading, copying and moving data, whether these are immediate values, values in registers, or memory locations pointed to by values in registers.  The opcode 10110000 (&lt;code&gt;B0&lt;/code&gt;) copies an 8-bit value into the ''AL'' register, while 10110001 (&lt;code&gt;B1&lt;/code&gt;) moves it into ''CL'' and 10110010 (&lt;code&gt;B2&lt;/code&gt;) does so into ''DL''. Assembly language examples for these follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;intel-1999-MOV&quot;/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
MOV AL, 1h        ; Load AL with immediate value 1
MOV CL, 2h        ; Load CL with immediate value 2
MOV DL, 3h        ; Load DL with immediate value 3
&lt;/source&gt;
The syntax of MOV can also be more complex as the following examples show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=David|title=x86 Assembly Guide|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=18 November 2010|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
MOV EAX, [EBX]	  ; Move the 4 bytes in memory at the address contained in EBX into EAX
MOV [ESI+EAX], CL ; Move the contents of CL into the byte at address ESI+EAX
&lt;/source&gt;
In each case, the MOV mnemonic is translated directly into an opcode in the ranges 88-8E, A0-A3, B0-B8, C6 or C7 by an assembler, and the programmer does not have to know or remember which.&lt;ref name=&quot;intel-1999-MOV&quot;/&gt;

Transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler, and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a [[disassembler]]. Unlike [[high-level language]]s, there is usually a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases, an assembler may provide ''pseudoinstructions'' (essentially macros) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a &quot;branch if greater or equal&quot; instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's &quot;set if less than&quot; and &quot;branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction)&quot;. Most full-featured assemblers also provide a rich [[macro (computer science)|macro]] language (discussed below) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences.

Each [[computer architecture]] and [[processor architecture]] usually has its own machine language.
On this level, each instruction is simple enough to be executed using a relatively small number of electronic circuits. Computers differ by the number and type of operations they support. For example, a machine with a 64-bit word length would have different circuitry from a 32-bit machine. They may also have different sizes and numbers of registers, and different representations of data types in storage. While most general-purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality, the ways they do so differ; the corresponding assembly languages may reflect these differences.

Multiple sets of [[mnemonic]]s or assembly-language syntax may exist for a single instruction set, typically instantiated in different assembler programs. In these cases, the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation.

==Language design==
===Basic elements===
There is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use. In particular, some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo-operation (pseudo-op). A typical assembly language consists of 3 types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations:
*[[Opcode]] mnemonics
*Data sections
*Assembly directives

====Opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonics====
Instructions (statements) in assembly language are generally very simple, unlike those in [[high-level programming language|high-level language]]. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction (an [[opcode]]), and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an ''operation'' or ''opcode'' plus zero or more ''[[operand]]s''. Most instructions refer to a single value, or a pair of values.  Operands can be immediate (typically one byte values, coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction, implied or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. ''Extended mnemonics'' are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use '''B''' as an extended mnemonic for '''BC''' with a mask of 15 and '''NOP''' for '''BC''' with a mask of 0.

''Extended mnemonics'' are often used to support specialized uses of instructions, often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name. For example, many CPU's do not have an explicit NOP instruction, but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose. In 8086 CPUs the instruction ''xchg ax,ax'' is used for ''nop'', with ''nop'' being a pseudo-opcode to encode the instruction ''xchg ax,ax''. Some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the ''xchg ax,ax'' instruction as ''nop''. Similarly, IBM assemblers for [[IBM System/360|System/360]] and [[IBM System/370|System/370]] use the extended mnemonics ''NOP'' and ''NOPR'' for ''BC'' and ''BCR'' with zero masks.

Some assemblers also support simple built-in macro-instructions that generate two or more machine instructions. For instance, with some Z80 assemblers the instruction ''ld hl,bc'' is recognized to generate ''ld l,c'' followed by ''ld h,b''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.z80.de/z80/z80code.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes known as ''pseudo-opcodes''.

====Data sections====
There are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables.  They define the type of data, the length and the alignment of data. These instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs (programs assembled separately) or only to the program in which the data section is defined. Some assemblers classify these as pseudo-ops.

====Assembly directives====
Assembly directives, also called pseudo opcodes, pseudo-operations or pseudo-ops, are instructions that are executed by an assembler at assembly time, not by a CPU at run time.  They can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer, so that one program can be assembled different ways, perhaps for different applications.  They also can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain.

(For example, directives would be used to reserve storage areas and optionally their initial contents.) The names of directives often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions.

Symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names (''[[label (programming language)|label]]s'' or ''symbols'') with memory locations. Usually, every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name, thus promoting [[self-documenting code]]. In executable code, the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point, so any calls to a subroutine can use its name. Inside subroutines, [[GOTO]] destinations are given labels. Some assemblers support ''local symbols'' which are lexically distinct from normal symbols (e.g., the use of &quot;10$&quot; as a GOTO destination).

Some{{which?|date=December 2010}} assemblers provide flexible symbol management, letting programmers manage different [[namespace (computer science)|namespaces]], automatically calculate offsets within [[data structure]]s, and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler. Labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses.

Assembly languages, like most other computer languages, allow comments to be added to assembly [[source code]] that are ignored by the assembler. Good use of comments is even more important with assembly code than with higher-level languages, as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of instructions is harder to decipher from the code itself.

Wise use of these facilities can greatly simplify the problems of coding and maintaining low-level code. ''Raw'' assembly source code as generated by compilers or disassemblers—code without any comments, meaningful symbols, or data definitions—is quite difficult to read when changes must be made.

===Macros===
Many assemblers support ''predefined macros'', and others support ''programmer-defined'' (and repeatedly re-definable) macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded. This sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives. Once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic. When the assembler processes such a statement, it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro, then processes them as if they existed in the source code file (including, in some assemblers, expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text).

Since macros can have 'short' names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code, they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. They can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs, optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features.

Many assemblers have built-in (or ''predefined'') macros for system calls and other special code sequences, such as the generation and storage of data realized through advanced bitwise and [[Boolean data type|boolean]] operations used in gaming, software security, data management, and cryptography.

Macro assemblers often allow macros to take [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]]s. Some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages, incorporating such high-level language elements as optional parameters, symbolic variables, conditionals, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations, all usable during the execution of a given macro, and allowing macros to save context or exchange information. Thus a macro might generate a large number of assembly language instructions or data definitions, based on the macro arguments. This could be used to generate record-style data structures or &quot;unrolled&quot; loops, for example, or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters. An organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher-level language, since such programmers are not working with a computer's lowest-level conceptual elements.

Macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers' needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems. This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with [[IBM]]'s Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine (CMS/VM) and with IBM's &quot;real time transaction processing&quot; add-ons, [[CICS]], Customer Information Control System,  and [[Airline Control Program|ACP]]/[[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]], the airline/financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large [[computer reservations system]]s (CRS) and credit card systems today.

It was also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in COBOL using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code.

This was because, as was realized in the 1960s, the concept of &quot;macro processing&quot; is independent of the concept of &quot;assembly&quot;, the former being in modern terms more word processing, text processing, than generating object code. The concept of macro processing appeared, and appears, in the C programming language, which supports &quot;preprocessor instructions&quot; to set variables, and make conditional tests on their values. Note that unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers, the C preprocessor was not [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] because it lacked the ability to either loop or &quot;go to&quot;, the latter allowing programs to loop.

Despite the power of macro processing, it fell into disuse in many high level languages (a major exception being C/C++) while remaining a perennial for assemblers.  This was because many programmers were rather confused by macro parameter substitution and did not disambiguate macro processing from assembly and execution{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}.

Macro parameter substitution is strictly by name: at macro processing time, the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name. The most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name. In the macro:
&lt;tt&gt;
foo: macro a
load a*b
&lt;/tt&gt;
the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable, and the &quot;global&quot; variable or constant b would be used to multiply &quot;a&quot;. If foo is called with the parameter &lt;tt&gt;a-c&lt;/tt&gt;, the macro expansion of &lt;tt&gt;load a-c*b&lt;/tt&gt; occurs.  To avoid any possible ambiguity, users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions, or callers can parenthesize the input parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
   |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/503x3e3s%28v=VS.90%29.aspx

   |accessdate=2010-06-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PL/I and C/C++ feature macros, but this facility can only manipulate text.  On the other hand, homoiconic languages, such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Prolog]], and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], retain the power of assembly language macros because they are able to manipulate their own code as data.

===Support for structured programming===
Some assemblers have incorporated [[structured programming]] elements to encode execution flow. The earliest example of this approach was in the [[Concept-14 macro set]], originally proposed by Dr. H.D. Mills (March, 1970), and implemented by Marvin Kessler at IBM's Federal Systems Division, which extended the S/360 macro assembler with IF/ELSE/ENDIF and similar control flow blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

   |accessdate=May 25, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of [[GOTO]] operations in assembly code, one of the main factors causing [[spaghetti code]] in assembly language. This approach was widely accepted in the early 80s (the latter days of large-scale assembly language use).

A curious design was [[A-natural]], a &quot;stream-oriented&quot; assembler for 8080/[[Z80]] processors{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} from [[Whitesmiths|Whitesmiths Ltd.]] (developers of the [[Unix]]-like [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]] operating system, and what was reported to be the first commercial [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]]). The language was classified as an assembler, because it worked with raw machine elements such as opcodes, registers, and memory references; but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order. Parentheses and other special symbols, along with block-oriented structured programming constructs, controlled the sequence of the generated instructions. A-natural was built as the object language of a C compiler, rather than for hand-coding, but its logical syntax won some fans.

There has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large-scale assembly language development.&lt;ref name=&quot;assembly-language?cat=technology&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/assembly-language?cat=technology|title=assembly language: Definition and Much More from Answers.com|accessdate=2008-06-19|author=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of that, they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target system's architecture prevent the effective use of higher-level languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neshla.sourceforge.net/ NESHLA: The High Level, Open Source, 6502 Assembler for the Nintendo Entertainment System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of assembly language==
===Historical perspective===
Assembly languages were first developed in the 1950s, when they were referred to as [[second generation programming language]]s. For example, SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program) was a 1957 assembly language for the [[IBM 650]] computer.  Assembly languages eliminated much of the error-prone and time-consuming [[first-generation language|first-generation]] programming needed with the earliest computers, freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses. They were once widely used for all sorts of programming. However, by the 1980s (1990s on [[microcomputer]]s), their use had largely been supplanted by [[high-level language]]s{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, in the search for improved [[programming productivity]]. Today, although assembly language is almost always handled and generated by [[compiler]]s, it is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. Typical uses are [[device driver]]s, low-level [[embedded system]]s, and [[real-time computing|real-time]] systems.

Historically, a large number of programs have been written entirely in assembly language. Operating systems were almost exclusively written in assembly language until the widespread acceptance of [[C (programming language)|C]] in the 1970s and early 1980s. Many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well, including a large amount of the IBM mainframe software written by large corporations. [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]] eventually displaced much of this work, although a number of large organizations retained assembly-language application infrastructures well into the 90s.

Most early microcomputers relied on hand-coded assembly language, including most operating systems and large applications. This was because these systems had severe resource constraints, imposed idiosyncratic memory and display architectures, and provided limited, buggy system services. Perhaps more important was the lack of first-class high-level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use. A psychological factor may have also played a role: the first generation of microcomputer programmers retained a hobbyist, &quot;wires and pliers&quot; attitude.

In a more commercial context, the biggest reasons for using assembly language were minimal bloat (size), minimal overhead, greater speed, and reliability.

Typical examples of large assembly language programs from this time are IBM PC [[DOS]] operating systems and early applications such as the [[spreadsheet]] program [[Lotus 1-2-3]], and almost all popular games for the [[Atari 800]] family of home computers. Even into the 1990s, most console video games were written in assembly, including most games for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. According to some industry insiders, the assembly language was the best computer language to use to get the best performance out of the [[Sega Saturn]], a console that was notoriously challenging to develop and program games for.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eidolons-inn.net/tiki-index.php?page=SegaBase+Saturn Eidolon's Inn : SegaBase Saturn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The popular arcade game [[NBA Jam]] (1993) is another example. On the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, as well as ZX Spectrum home computers, assembler has long been the primary development language. This was in large part because BASIC dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed, as well as insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware on these systems. Some systems, most notably Amiga, even have IDEs with highly advanced debugging and macro facilities, such as the freeware [http://www.theflamearrows.info/homepage.html ASM-One assembler], comparable to that of [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] facilities (ASM-One predates Microsoft Visual Studio).

''The Assembler for the [[VIC-20]]'' was written by Don French and published by ''French Silk''. At 1639 bytes in length, its author believes it is the smallest symbolic assembler ever written. The assembler supported the usual symbolic addressing and the definition of [[character string]]s or hex strings. It also allowed address expressions which could be combined with [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[logical AND]], [[logical OR]], and [[exponentiation]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiks.net/~jimbo/art/int7.htm|title=Speaking with Don French : The Man Behind the French Silk Assembler Tools|date=2004-05-21|accessdate=2008-07-25|author=Jim Lawless|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage===
There have always been debates over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high-level languages. Assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important; see below. But in general, modern [[optimizing compiler]]s are claimed{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} to render high-level languages into code that can run as fast as hand-written assembly, despite the counter-examples that can be found.&lt;ref name=&quot;goto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/technology/28super.html?_r=1 |title=Writing the Fastest Code, by Hand, for Fun: A Human Computer Keeps Speeding Up Chips |publisher=New York Times, John Markoff |date=2005-11-28 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bit-fild&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hardwarebug.org/2010/01/30/bit-field-badness/ |title=Bit-field-badness |publisher=hardwarebug.org |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gcc-mess&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hardwarebug.org/2009/05/13/gcc-makes-a-mess/ |title=GCC makes a mess |publisher=hardwarebug.org |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of modern processors and memory sub-system makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers, as well as assembly programmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatDebate1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/GreatDebate/debate1.html|title=The Great Debate|date=|accessdate=2008-07-03|author=Randall Hyde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;compiler-fails1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hardwarebug.org/2008/11/28/codesourcery-fails-again/ |title=Code sourcery fails again|publisher=hardwarebug.org |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, and to the dismay of efficiency lovers, increasing processor performance has meant that most CPUs sit idle most of the time,{{Citation needed|reason=Mainframes normally run with a high CPU loading factor.|date=January 2011}} with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as [[I/O]] operations and [[paging]]. This has made raw code execution speed a non-issue for many programmers.

There are some situations in which practitioners might choose to use assembly language, such as when:
* a stand-alone binary executable of compact size is required, i.e. one that must execute without recourse to the [[Run-time system|run-time]] components or [[library (computer science)|libraries]] associated with a high-level language; this is perhaps the most common situation. These are embedded single-tasking programs, and use only a relatively small amount of memory. Examples include firmware for telephones, automobile fuel and ignition systems, air-conditioning control systems, security systems, and sensors.
** particularly, a system with severe resource constraints (e.g., an [[embedded system]]) must be hand-coded to maximize the use of limited resources; but this is becoming less common as processor price decreases and performance improves.
* interacting directly with the hardware, for example in [[device driver]]s and [[interrupt handler]]s.
* using processor-specific instructions not implemented in a compiler. A common example is the [[circular shift|bitwise rotation]] instruction at the core of many encryption algorithms.
* creating vectorized functions for programs in higher-level languages such as C.  In the higher-level language this is sometimes aided by compiler [[intrinsic function]]s which map directly to SIMD mnemonics, but nevertheless result in a one-to-one assembly conversion specific for the given vector processor.
* extreme optimization is required, e.g., in an inner [[Control_flow#Loops|loop]] in a processor-intensive algorithm. [[Game programmer]]s take advantage of the abilities of hardware features in systems, enabling games to run faster. Also large scientific simulations require highly optimized algorithms, e.g. [[linear algebra]] with [[Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms|BLAS]]&lt;ref name=&quot;goto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bench&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark-August2008 |title=BLAS Benchmark-August2008 |publisher=eigen.tuxfamily.org |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DCT (math)|discrete cosine transformation]] (e.g. [[SIMD]] assembly version from [[x264]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://git.videolan.org/?p=x264.git;a=tree;f=common/x86;hb=HEAD |title=x264.git/common/x86/dct-32.asm |publisher=git.videolan.org |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* no high-level language exists, on a new or specialized processor, for example.
* programs need precise timing such as
** [[real-time computing|real-time]] programs that need precise timing and responses, such as simulations, flight navigation systems, and medical equipment. For example, in a [[fly-by-wire]] system, telemetry must be interpreted and acted upon within strict time constraints. Such systems must eliminate sources of unpredictable delays, which may be created by (some) interpreted languages, automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], paging operations, or [[preemptive multitasking]]. However, some higher-level languages incorporate run-time components and operating system interfaces that can introduce such delays. Choosing assembly or lower-level languages for such systems gives programmers greater visibility and control over processing details.
** cryptographic algorithms that must always take strictly the same time to execute, preventing [[timing attack]]s.
* complete control over the environment is required, in extremely high security situations where [[Trusting trust#Reflections on Trusting Trust|nothing can be taken for granted]].
* writing [[computer virus]]es, [[bootloader]]s, certain [[device driver]]s, or other items very close to the hardware or low-level operating system.
* writing [[instruction set simulator]]s for monitoring, tracing and [[debugging]] where additional overhead is kept to a minimum
* [[reverse-engineering]] and modifying program files such as
**existing [[binary file|binaries]] that may or may not have originally been written in a high-level language, for example when trying to recreate programs for which source code is not available or has been lost, or cracking copy protection of proprietary software.
** [[video game]]s (also termed [[ROM hacking]]), which is possible via several methods. The most widely employed is altering program code at the assembly language level.
* writing [[self modifying code]], to which assembly language lends itself well.
* writing [[calculator gaming|games]] and other software for [[graphing calculator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tifreakware.net/tutorials/89/a/calc/fargoii.htm|title=68K Programming in Fargo II|date=|accessdate=2008-07-03|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* writing compiler software that generates assembly code; the programmers must be expert assembly language programmers to generate correct assembly code.

Assembly language is still taught in most [[computer science]] and [[electronic engineering]] programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as [[binary arithmetic]], [[memory allocation]], [[stack (data structure)|stack processing]], [[character set]] encoding, [[interrupt]] processing, and [[compiler]] design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/fwd.html|title=Foreword (&quot;Why would anyone learn this stuff?&quot;), ''op. cit.''|date=1996-09-30|accessdate=2010-03-05|author=Hyde, Randall}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although [[calculator]]s are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.

===Typical applications===
Hard-coded assembly language is typically used in a system's [[boot ROM]] ([[BIOS]] on IBM-compatible [[Personal Computer|PC]] systems). This low-level code is used, among other things, to initialize and test the system hardware prior to booting the OS, and is stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. Once a certain level of hardware initialization has taken place, execution transfers to other code, typically written in higher level languages; but the code running immediately after power is applied is usually written in assembly language. The same is true of most [[boot loader]]s.

Many compilers render high-level languages into assembly first before fully compiling, allowing the assembly code to be viewed for [[debug]]ging and optimization purposes. Relatively low-level languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], often provide special [[syntax of programming languages|syntax]] to embed assembly language directly in the source code. Programs using such facilities, such as the [[Linux kernel]], can then construct abstractions using different assembly language on each hardware platform. The system's [[software portability|portable]] code can then use these processor-specific components through a uniform interface.

Assembly language is also valuable in [[reverse engineering]], since many programs are distributed only in machine code form, and machine code is usually easy to translate into assembly language and carefully examine in this form, but very difficult to translate into a higher-level language. Tools such as the [[Interactive Disassembler]] make extensive use of disassembly for such a purpose.

One niche that makes use of assembly language is the [[demoscene]]. Certain competitions require contestants to restrict their creations to a very small size (e.g. 256[[Bytes|B]], 1[[Kilobyte|KB]], 4KB or 64 KB), and assembly language is the language of choice to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080211025322rn_1/www.256b.com/home.php|title=256bytes demos archives|date=|accessdate=2008-07-03|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources, especially CPU processing-constrained systems, like the earlier [[Amiga]] models, and the [[Commodore 64]], are a concern, assembler coding is a must. Optimized assembler code is written &quot;by hand&quot; and instructions are sequenced manually by [[programmer]]s in an attempt to minimize the number of CPU cycles used. The CPU constraints are so great that every CPU cycle counts. However, using such methods has enabled systems like the Commodore 64 to produce real-time [[3D graphics]] with advanced effects, a feat which might be considered unlikely or even impossible for a system with a 1.02[[MHz]] processor. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Related terminology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Assembly language]] --&gt;
* '''Assembly language''' or '''assembler language''' is commonly called '''assembly''', '''assembler''', '''ASM''', or '''symbolic machine code'''. A generation of IBM mainframe programmers called it '''ALC''' for ''Assembly Language Code'' or '''BAL'''&lt;ref&gt;Techically BAL was only the assembler for '''BPS'''; the others were macro assemblers.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Basic Assembly Language''.

:: Note: Calling the language '''assembler''' is of course potentially confusing and ambiguous, since this is also the name of the utility program that translates assembly language statements into machine code. Some may regard this as imprecision or error. However, this usage has been common among professionals and in the literature for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Stroustrup, Bjarne, ''The C++ Programming Language'', Addison-Wesley, 1986, ISBN 0-201-12078-X: ''&quot;C++ was primarily designed so that the author and his friends would not have to program in assembler, C, or various modern high-level languages.'' [use of the term ''assembler'' to mean ''assembly language'']&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some early computers called their ''assembler'' their '''assembly program'''.&lt;ref&gt;Saxon, James, and Plette, William, ''Programming the IBM 1401'', Prentice-Hall, 1962, LoC 62-20615. [use of the term ''assembly program'']&lt;/ref&gt;)
* The computational step where an assembler is run, including all macro processing, is termed '''assembly time'''.
* The use of the word '''assembly''' dates from the early years of computers (''cf.'' [[Short Code (Computer language)|short code]], [[speedcoding|speedcode]]).
* A '''cross assembler''' (see [[cross compiler]]) is functionally just an assembler. This term is used to stress that the assembler is run on a computer or [[operating system]] of different  type and incompatible with the system on which the resulting code is to run. Cross-assembling may be necessary if the target system cannot run an assembler itself, as is typically the case for small embedded systems. A cross assembler must provide for or interface to facilities to transport the code to the target processor, e.g. to reside in flash or EPROM memory. It generates a binary image, or [[Intel HEX]] file rather than an [[object file]].
* An '''assembler directive''' or ''pseudo-opcode'' is a command given to an assembler. These directives may do anything from telling the assembler to include other source files, to telling it to allocate memory for constant data.

==List of assemblers for different computer architectures==
The following page has a list of different assemblers for the different computer architectures, along with any associated information for that specific assembler:
* [[List of assemblers]]

==Further details==
For any given personal computer, mainframe, embedded system, and game console, both past and present, at least one &amp;mdash; possibly dozens &amp;mdash; of assemblers have been written. For some examples, see the [[list of assemblers]].

On [[Unix]] systems, the assembler is traditionally called [[as (Unix)|as]], although it is not a single body of code, being typically written anew for each port. A number of Unix variants use [[GNU Assembler|GAS]].

Within processor groups, each assembler has its own dialect. Sometimes, some assemblers can read another assembler's dialect, for example, [[TASM]] can read old [[MASM]] code, but not the reverse. [[FASM]] and [[Netwide Assembler|NASM]] have similar syntax, but each support different macros that could make them difficult to translate to each other. The basics are all the same, but the advanced features will differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyde&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/WhichAsm.html|title = Which Assembler is the Best? |accessdate = 2007-10-19|author = Randall Hyde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, assembly can sometimes be portable across different operating systems on the same type of [[CPU]]. [[Calling convention]]s between operating systems often differ slightly or not at all, and with care it is possible to gain some portability in assembly language, usually by linking with a [[C (programming language)|C]] library that does not change between operating systems. An  [[instruction set simulator]] (which would ideally be written in an assembler language) can, in theory, process the [[object code]]/ [[binary file|binary]] of ''any'' assembler to achieve portability even across [[platform (computing)|platform]]s (with an overhead no greater than a typical bytecode interpreter). This is essentially what microcode achieves when a hardware platform changes internally.

For example, many things in [[libc]] depend on the preprocessor to do OS-specific, C-specific things to the program before compiling. In fact, some functions and symbols are not even guaranteed to exist outside of the preprocessor. Worse, the size and field order of structs, as well as the size of certain [[typedef]]s such as off_t, are entirely unavailable in assembly language without help from a [[configure script]], and differ even between versions of [[Linux]], making it impossible to portably call functions in libc other than ones that only take simple integers and pointers as parameters. To address this issue, [[FASMLIB]] project provides a portable assembly library for Win32 and Linux platforms, but it is yet very incomplete.&lt;ref name=&quot;FASMLIB&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fasmlib.x86asm.net/features.html|title = FASMLIB: Features|accessdate = 2007-10-19|author = &quot;''vid''&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some higher level computer languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Borland Pascal]], support [[inline assembler|inline assembly]] where sections of assembly code, in practice usually brief, can be embedded into the high level language code. The [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] language commonly contains an assembler used in CODE words.

An [[emulator]] can be used to to debug assembly-language programs.

==Example listing of assembly language source code==
&lt;!-- This is a really poor example of an assembly language program for learning what assembler is. Showing the actual binary code , rather than (conventionally) its hex equivalent and bundling opcodes together with their operands makes it really hard to read and understand. There are also no comments on the statements which IMHO is a serious ommision from most standpoints. Please look at an [[IBM/360]] assembler to see how it should be done (eg. &quot;loop unwinding&quot; article - dynamic loop unwinding example) --&gt;

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], '''''ambrosia''''' ({{lang-el|ἀμβροσία}}) is sometimes the food, sometimes the drink, of the Greek gods (or demigods), often depicted as conferring ageless [[immortality]] upon whoever consumes it.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Griffiths  | first = Alan H.  | contribution = Ambrosia  | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link = | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was brought to the gods in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] by doves,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xii.62&lt;/ref&gt; so it may have been thought of in the Homeric tradition as a kind of divine exhalation of the Earth.

==Definition==
{{For|its Indian equivalent|Amrita}}
Ambrosia is very closely related to the gods' other form of sustenance, ''[[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]]''. The two terms may not have originally been distinguished;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Attempts to draw any significant distinctions between the functions of nectar and ambrosia have failed.&quot; Clay, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; though in [[Homer]]'s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods; it was with ambrosia Hera &quot;cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' xiv.170&lt;/ref&gt; and with ambrosia Athena prepared Penelope in her sleep,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xviii.188ff&lt;/ref&gt; so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors, the effect of the years had been stripped away and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her. On the other hand, in [[Alcman]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alcman]], fragment 42&lt;/ref&gt; nectar is the food, and in [[Sappho]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sappho]], fragment 141 LP&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anaxandrides]], ambrosia is the drink.&lt;ref&gt;When Anaxandrides says &quot;I eat nectar and drink ambrosia&quot;, Wright, p. 5, suggested he was using comic inversion.&lt;/ref&gt; When a character in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Knights|Knights]]'' says, &quot;I dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head— out of a ladle&quot;, the homely and realistic ladle brings the ineffable moment to ground with a thump. 

The consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings. Upon his assumption into immortality on Olympus, [[Heracles]] is given ambrosia by [[Athena]], while the hero [[Tydeus]] is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains. In one version of the myth of [[Tantalus]], part of Tantalus' crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself, he attempts to steal some away to give to other mortals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' 1. 50. ff&lt;/ref&gt; Those who consume ambrosia typically had not blood in their veins, but [[ichor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' v. 340, 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant, and may be used as [[perfume]]: in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' Menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins, &quot;and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore; but the goddess saved us; she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv.444-46&lt;/ref&gt; Homer speaks of ambrosial raiment, ambrosial locks of hair, even the gods' ambrosial sandals.

Among later writers, ''ambrosia'' has been so often used with generic meanings of &quot;delightful liquid&quot; that such late writers as [[Athenaeus]], [[Paulus]] and [[Dioscurides]] employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery,&lt;ref&gt;In Athenaeus, a sauce of oil, water and fruit juice.&lt;/ref&gt; medicine,&lt;ref&gt;In Paulus, a medicinal draught.&lt;/ref&gt; and botany.&lt;ref&gt;Dioscurides remarked its Latin name was ''ros marinus'', &quot;sea-dew&quot;, or [[rosemary]]; these uses were noted by Wright 1917:6.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Additionally, some modern [[Ethnomycology|ethnomycologists]], such as [[Danny Staples]], identify ambrosia with the untameable [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'': &quot;it was the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices&quot;, Staples asserts.&lt;ref&gt;Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, ''The World of Classical Myth'' 1994:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. H. Roscher]] thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of [[honey]], in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing power of honey, which is in fact anti-septic, and because fermented honey ([[mead]]) preceded [[wine]] as an [[entheogen]] in the Aegean world: on some Minoan seals goddesses had [[bee]] faces: compare [[Merope]] and [[Melissa]].

[[Propolis]], a hive product also known for its sweet fruity taste, cures sore throats, and there are many modern proprietary medicines which use honey as an ingredient.

== Etymology ==
The concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two Indo-European areas: Greek and Sanskrit. The Greek ἀμβροσία (ambrosia) is semantically linked to the Sanskrit अमृत (''[[amrita]]'') as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words may be derived from the same Indo-European form *ṇ-mṛ-to- : immortal (n- : negative prefix equivalent to the prefix a- in both Greek and Sanskrit; mṛ : [[Ablaut|zero grade]] of *mer- : to die; and -to- : adjectival suffix). A semantically similar etymology exists for [[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]], the beverage of the gods ([[Greek language|Greek]]: νέκταρ, ''néktar'') presumed to be a compound of the [[PIE]] roots ''*nek-'', &quot;death&quot;, and ''-*tar'', &quot;overcoming&quot;.
 
However, the connection that has derived ''ambrosia'' from the Greek prefix ''a-'' (&quot;not&quot;) and the word ''brotos'' (&quot;mortal&quot;), hence the food or drink of the immortals, has been questioned as coincidental by some modern linguists.&lt;ref&gt;So noted by Wright 1917:6&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical scholar [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]] denied that there is any clear example in which the word ''ambrosios'' necessarily means ''immortal'', and preferred to explain it as &quot;fragrant,&quot; a sense which is always suitable. If so, the word may be derived from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ''MBR'', giving &quot;[[amber]]&quot;, which when burned is resinously fragrant (compare &quot;[[ambergris]]&quot;) to which Eastern nations attribute miraculous properties.  In Europe, honey-colored amber, sometimes far from its natural source, was already a grave gift in [[Neolithic]] times and was still worn in the 7th century as a talisman by [[Druidry|druidic]] [[Frisia]]ns, though St. [[Eligius]] warned &quot;No woman should presume to hang amber from her neck.&quot;

== Other examples in mythology ==
[[File:Johann Balthasar Probst 002.jpg|thumb|Thetis anoints Achilles with ambrosia]]
*In one version of the story of the birth of [[Achilles]], [[Thetis]] anoints the infant with ambrosia and passes the child through the fire to make him immortal&amp;mdash;a familiar [[Phoenicia]]n custom&amp;mdash;but [[Peleus]], appalled, stops her, leaving only his heel unimmortalised (''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869-879).
*In the ''[[Iliad]]'' xvi, [[Apollo]] washes the black blood from the corpse of [[Sarpedon]] and anoints it with ambrosia, readying it for its dreamlike return to Sarpedon's native [[Lycia]]. Similarly, [[Thetis]] anoints the corpse of [[Patroclus]] in order to preserve it. Additionally, both ambrosia and nectar are depicted as [[unguent]]s (xiv. 170; xix. 38).
*In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] is described as having &quot;spread a table with ambrosia and set it by [[Hermes]], and mixed the rosy-red nectar.&quot;  It is ambiguous whether he means the ambrosia itself is rosy-red, or if he is describing a rosy-red nectar Hermes drinks along with the ambrosia.  Later, [[Circe]] mentions to [[Odysseus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' xi: &quot;the trembling doves that carry ambrosia to Father Zeus.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that a flock of doves are the bringers of ambrosia to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].
*In the ''Odyssey'' (ix.345&amp;ndash;359), [[Polyphemus]] likens the wine given to him by [[Odysseus]] to ambrosia and nectar.
*One of the impieties of [[Tantalus]], according to [[Pindar]], was that he offered to his guests the ambrosia of the Deathless Ones, a theft akin to that of [[Prometheus]], [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted (in ''Heroes of the Greeks'').
*In the [[Homeric hymn]] to [[Aphrodite]], the goddess uses &quot;ambrosian oil&quot; as perfume, &quot;divinely sweet, and made fragrant for her sake.&quot;
*In the myth of [[Psyche]] and [[Eros]], Psyche is given ambrosia by [[Hermes]] upon her completion of the quests set by Aphrodite and her acceptance on Olympus.  After she partakes, she and Eros are wed as gods.
==Lykourgos of Thrace and Ambrosia==
{{See|Lycurgus (Thrace)}}
Lykourgos (Lycurgus) of Thrace, an antagonist of [[Dionysus]], forbade the cult of Dionysus, whom he drove from [[Thrace]], and was driven mad by the god. In his fit of insanity he killed his son, whom he mistook for a stock of mature [[ivy]], and '''Ambrosia''', who was transformed into the [[Vitis|grapevine]].

'''Aurelius Ambrosius''', better known in English as '''Saint Ambrose''' (c. between 337 and 340&amp;nbsp;– 4 April 397), was a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]] who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century. He was one of the four original [[doctors of the Church]].

==Life==
===Political career===
Ambrose was born into a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Christian]] family between about 337 and 340 and was raised in [[Trier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=St. Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Ambrosius Aurelius,&lt;ref&gt;Greenslade, Stanley Lawrence. Early Latin theology: selections from Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, and Jerome, Volume 5 of Library of Christian classics, Westminster John Knox Press, 1956, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|praetorian prefect of Gaul]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot;/&gt; his mother was a woman of intellect and piety. Ambrose's siblings, [[Satyrus of Milan|Satyrus]] (who is the subject of Ambrose's ''De excessu fratris Satyri'') and [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]], are also venerated as saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90298 Santi Beati] {{it_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of [[bee]]s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of [[honey]]. His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] often appear in the [[Saint symbology|saint's symbology]].

After the early death of his father, Ambrose followed his father's career. He was educated in Rome, studying [[literature]], [[law]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Smith | title = St. Ambrosius | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 139–140 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0148.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praetor]] [[Anicius Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him [[consular prefect]] or &quot;Governor&quot; of [[Liguria]] and [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], with headquarters at [[Milan]], which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot; /&gt;

Ambrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan. He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Valentinian I]]. Ambrose never married.

===Bishop of Milan===
[[File:Francisco de Zurbarán 032.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''St. Ambrose'', by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]]]]
In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the [[diocese of Milan]] between the Catholics and [[Arianism|Arians]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wilken, &quot;The Spirit of Early Christian Thought&quot; (Yale University Press: New Haven, 2003), pp. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Walsh 1991 pp. 407&quot;&gt;Michael Walsh, ed. &quot;Butler's Lives of the Saints&quot; (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), pp. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; In 374 [[Auxentius of Milan|the bishop of Milan, Auxentius]], an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the [[Apostolic succession|succession]]. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call &quot;Ambrose, bishop!&quot;, which was taken up by the whole assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Walsh 1991 pp. 407&quot;/&gt;

Ambrose was known to be Catholic in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot;/&gt; Upon his appointment, St. Ambrose fled to a colleague's home to seek hiding. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, St. Ambrose's host gave Ambrose up. Within a week, Ambrose was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]].

As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] (who later became a nun),&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt; and committed the care of his family to his brother. Ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of &quot;The Goodness Of Death&quot;.

===Ambrose and Arians===
According to legend, Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped [[Arianism]] in Milan. In his pursuit of the study of theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome he was to excel. Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Hebrew Bible and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxcviii.html Letter of Basil to Ambrose]&lt;/ref&gt; He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed [[Augustine of Hippo]], who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.

In the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were heretical. The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] held [[Chalcedonian Christianity|orthodox]] belief in the [[Nicene]] creed, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the empire, adhered to the Arian creed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Walsh 1991 pp. 408&quot;&gt;Michael Walsh, ed. &quot;Butler's Lives of the Saints&quot; (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the [[Nicene]] creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.

In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria|Palladius]] of [[Ratiaria]] and [[Secundianus of Singidunum|Secundianus]] of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon [[Gratian]] to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from the episcopal office.

Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Walsh 1991 pp. 408&quot;/&gt; or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the basilica of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Walsh 1991 pp. 408&quot;/&gt; Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot;/&gt; He went, his eloquence in defence of the Church reportedly overawed the ministers of Emperor Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing divine service in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still continued obstinate, the court proceeded to violent measures {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}: the officers of the household were commanded to prepare the [[Basilica]] and the Portian churches to celebrate divine service upon the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]].

In spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop Ambrose declared:
{{quote|If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to [[prison]] or to [[death]], I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of [[Jesus|Christ]]. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the [[altar]] rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but [[God]] alone can appease it.}}

===Ambrose and Jews===

An address by Ambrose to Christian young people warns them against intermarriage with Jews (&quot;De Abrahamo,&quot; ix. 84, xiv. 451). But his opposition assumed a more positive and active character in the matter of the bishop of Callinicum in [[Mesopotamia]]. It appears that in 388 a mob, led by the local bishop and many monks, destroyed the [[synagogue]] at Callinicum. The emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] ordered the rebuilding of the synagogue at the expense of the rioters, including the bishop. Ambrose immediately issued a fiery protest to the emperor. He writes to Theodosius (&quot;Epistolæ,&quot; xl. xvi. 1101 et seq.) that &quot;the glory of God&quot; is concerned in this matter, and that therefore he cannot be silent. &quot;Shall the bishop be compelled to reerect a synagogue? Can he religiously do this thing? If he obey the emperor, he will become a traitor to his faith; if he disobey him, a [[martyr]]. What real wrong is there, after all, in destroying a synagogue, a 'home of perfidy, a home of impiety,' in which Christ is daily blasphemed? Indeed, he must consider himself no less guilty than this poor bishop; at least to the extent that he made no concealment of his wish that all synagogues should be destroyed, that no such places of blasphemy be further allowed to exist.&quot; At the end, he succeeded in obtaining from Theodosius a promise that the sentence should be completely revoked, with the very natural consequence that thereafter the prospect of immunity thus afforded occasioned spoliations of synagogues all over the empire. That Ambrose could nevertheless occasionally say a good word for the Jews is shown by a passage in his &quot;Enarratio in Psalmos&quot; (i. 41, xiv. 943), in which he remarks, &quot;Some Jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study.&quot;

===Ambrose and emperors===
[[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|300px|''Saint Ambrose and emperor Theodosius'' by [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]].]]
[[Image:Sant'Ambrogio Cript in Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The crypt in Sant'Ambrogio basilica.]]
The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor. When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.

On a second attempt of the same kind Ambrose was again employed; and although he was unsuccessful, it cannot be doubted that, if his advice had been followed, the schemes of the usurper would have proved abortive; but the enemy was permitted to enter [[Italy]]; and [[Milan]] was taken. Justina and her son fled; but Ambrose remained at his post, and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.

In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused [[Valentinian II]]'s imperial request to hand over the [[Portian basilica]] for the use of Arian troops. In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop Auxentius, and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History'' p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was threatened with excommunication by Ambrose for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]] of 7,000 persons at [[Thessalonika|Thessalonica]] in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot;/&gt; Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt&amp;nbsp;— Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance . This incident shows the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor&amp;nbsp;— the controversy of [[John Chrysostom]] with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.

In 392, after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the acclamation of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.

====Persecution of Paganism====
{{main|Persecution of Paganism under the influence of Saint Ambrose}}

Under Ambrose's major influence, emperors [[Gratian]], [[Valentinian II]] and [[Theodosius I]] carried on a persecution of [[Paganism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Byfield2003&quot;&gt;Byfield (2003) pp.92-4 quote: {{quotation|In the west, such [anti-Pagan] tendencies were less pronounces, although they had one especially powerful advocate. No one was more determined to destroy paganism than Ambrose, bishop of Milan, a major influence upon both Gratian and Valentinian II. [...] p.94 The man who ruled the ruler - Wether Ambrose, the senator-bureaucrat-turned-bishop. was Theodosius's mentor or his autocrat, the emperor heeded him--as did most of the fourth-century church.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMullen1984p100&quot;&gt;MacMullen (1984) p.100 quote: {{quotation|The law of June 391, issued by Theodosius [...] was issued from Milan and represented the will of its bishop, Ambrose; for Theodosius--recently excommunicated by Ambrose, penitent, and very much under his influence&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;--was no natural zealot. Ambrose, on the other hand, was very much a Christian. His restless and imperious ambition for the church's growth, come what might for the non-Christians, is suggested by his preaching.}} See also note 43 at p.163, with references to Palanque (1933), Gaudemet (1972), Matthews (1975) and King (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roldanus (2006) p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo (1989) p.254&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ambrose's zealous pressure, Theodosius issued the infamous 391 &quot;Theodosian decrees,&quot; a declaration of war on paganism,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMullen1984p100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;King1961p78&quot;&gt;King (1961) p.78&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Altar of Victory]] was removed by Gratian.

===Death and legacy===
Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the [[Roman empire]], Theodosius died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397) Ambrose also died. He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by [[Simplician]]. Ambrose's body may still be viewed in the church of S. Ambrogio in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated&amp;nbsp;— along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of [[Sts. Gervase and Protase]]&amp;nbsp;— and is one of the oldest extant bodies of historical personages known outside [[Egypt]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Character===
[[Image:AmbroseStatue.png|thumb|left|100px|Drawing based on a statue of St. Ambrose]]
Many circumstances in the history of Ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.

He was generous to the [[poverty|poor]]; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two [[martyr]]s, [[Gervasius]] and [[Protasius]]. The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.

==Theology==
Ambrose ranks with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory the Great]], as one of the [[Latin]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. Theologians compare him with [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]], who they claim fell short of Ambrose's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater [[theology|theological]] ability. He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of [[Biblical]] and [[doctrinal]] subjects.  His spiritual successor, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], whose conversion was helped by Ambrose's [[sermon]]s, owes more to him than to any writer except [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.

Ambrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing [[doctrine]] of the Church and its [[sacerdotal]] ministry, while the prevalent [[asceticism]] of the day, continuing the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cicero]]nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian [[ethics]]. Thus we have the ''De officiis ministrorum'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'' and ''De paenitentia''.

Ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place.  His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom.  &quot;When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not.  Follow the custom of the church where you are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Augustine of Hippo, Epistle to Januarius, II, section 18, and in Epistle to Casualanus, XXXVI, section 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Ambrose refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the &quot;right&quot; liturgical form where there was no substantial problem.  His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, &quot;[[wikt:when in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome, do as the Romans do.]]&quot;

One interpretation of Ambrose's writings is that he was a [[Christian universalism|Christian universalist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hanson&quot;&gt;J.W. Hanson. ''Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years''. &quot;[http://hellbusters.8m.com/upd18.html Chapter 18 Additional Authorities]&quot;. Boston and Chicago Universalist Publishing House. 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Ambrose's theology was significantly influenced by that of [[Origen]] and [[Didymus the Blind]], two other early Christian universalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanson&quot;/&gt; One quotation cited in favor of this belief:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our Savior has appointed two kinds of resurrection in the Apocalypse. 'Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection,' for such come to grace without the judgment. As for those who do not come to the first, but are reserved unto the second resurrection, these shall be disciplined until their appointed times, between the first and the second resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.tentmaker.org/Quotes/churchfathersquotes.htm The Church Fathers on Universalism]&quot;. at ''Tentmaker.org''. Accessed December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell).  Several other works by Ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, ''and therefore have lost the grace of redemption'', because they reject that on which salvation depends.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose.

==Mariology==
The powerful Mariology of Ambrose of Milan influenced contemporary Popes like [[Pope Damasus]] and [[Siricius]] and later, [[Pope Leo the Great]]. Central to Ambrose is the  [[virginity]] of Mary and her role as [[Mother of God]].

* The virgin birth is worthy of  God.  Which human birth would have been more worthy of God, than the one,  in which the Immaculate Son of God maintained the purity of his immaculate origin while becoming human?&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose of Milan CSEL 64, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

* We confess, that Christ the Lord was born from a virgin, and therefore we reject the natural order of things.  Because not from a man she conceived but from the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose of Milan, De Mysteriis, 59, PG 16, 410&lt;/ref&gt;

* Christ is not divided but one. If we adore him as the Son of God,  we do not deny his birth from the virgin... But nobody shall extend this to Mary. Mary was the temple of God but not God in the temple. Therefore only the one who was in the temple can be worshipped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf210.iv.ii.iv.xi.html?highlight=mary,was,the,temple,of,god,but,not,in#highlight Ambrose of Milan,  De Spiritu Sancto, III, 11,79-80]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Yes, truly blessed for having surpassed the priest (Zechariah). While the priest denied, the Virgin rectified the error. No wonder that the Lord, wishing to rescue the world, began his work with Mary. Thus she, through whom salvation was being prepared for all people, would be the first to receive the promised fruit of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose of Milan,  Expositio in Lucam 2, 17; PL 15, 1640&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambrose viewed [[virginity]] as superior to marriage and saw [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mary]] as the model of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;''De virginibus'' (On Virgins); ''De virginitate''&lt;/ref&gt; He is alleged to have founded an institution for virgins in Rome.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In matters of [[exegesis]] he is, like Hilary, an [[Alexandrian]]. In [[dogma]] he follows [[Basil of Caesarea]] and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats.  This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human [[sin]] and [[divine grace]], and in the place which he assigns to [[faith]] in the individual Christian life.
