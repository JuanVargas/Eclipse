[toxicity]] (especially by inhalation) of beryllium-containing dusts. Beryllium is corrosive to tissue, and can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease called [[berylliosis]] in some people. As it is not [[nucleosynthesis|synthesized]] in stars, beryllium is a relatively rare element in both the Earth and the universe. The element is not known to be necessary or useful for either plant or animal life.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
Beryllium has exceptional [[flexural rigidity]] ([[Young's modulus]] 287 GPa) and a reasonably high [[melting point]]. The [[modulus of elasticity]] of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast [[speed of sound|sound conduction speed]] in beryllium – about 12.9&amp;nbsp;km/s at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]]. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear [[thermal expansion]] (11.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.&lt;ref name=Be&gt;{{Cite book| title = Landolt-Börnstein&amp;nbsp;– Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data.

===Nuclear properties===
Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 [[barn (unit)|barn]]s for energies above ~0.01 eV. Therefore, it effectively slows the neutrons to the [[neutron temperature|thermal energy]] range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material. The predominant beryllium isotope &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction to &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be, which then instantaneously breaks into two alpha particles; that is, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:&lt;ref name =&quot;BeMelurgy&quot;/&gt; 
:{{Nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n → 2({{Nuclide|Helium|4}}) + 2n

As a metal, beryllium is [[transparent]] to most wavelengths of [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, making it useful for the output windows of [[X-ray tube]]s and other such apparatus. It is also a good source for the relatively-small numbers of free [[neutron]]s in the laboratory which are liberated when beryllium [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are struck by energetic [[alpha particle]]s&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; producing the nuclear reaction
:{{Nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + {{Nuclide|Helium|4}} → {{Nuclide|Carbon|12}} + n , where {{Nuclide|Helium|4}} is an alpha particle and {{Nuclide|Carbon|12}} is a [[carbon-12]] nucleus.&lt;ref name =&quot;BeMelurgy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=FCnUN45cL1cC&amp;pg=PA239|page = 239|chapter = Nuclear Properties|title = Beryllium its Metallurgy and Properties|publisher = University of California Press|first = Henry H|last = Hausner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes and nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-10}}
[[File:Solar Activity Proxies.png|thumb|300px|Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be concentration. Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be levels]]
Beryllium contains only one stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be, and therefore is a [[monoisotopic element]]. [[Cosmogenic]] &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]] by the [[cosmic ray spallation]] of [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. Cosmogenic &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be accumulates at the [[soil]] surface, where its relatively long [[half-life]] (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to [[boron]]-10. Thus, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural [[soil erosion]], [[soil formation]] and the development of [[laterite|lateritic soil]]s, and as a [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for measurement of the variations in [[solar activity]] and the age of [[ice core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/beryllium.html |title=Beryllium: Isotopes and Hydrology |author= |date= |work= |publisher=University of Arizona, Tucson |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is inversely proportional to the solar activity, because the increased [[solar wind]] during periods of high solar magnetic activity in turn decreases the flux of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at [[nuclear weapon test]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.016|year=2008|month=Feb|author=Whitehead, N; Endo, S; Tanaka, K; Takatsuji, T; Hoshi, M; Fukutani, S; Ditchburn, Rg; Zondervan, A|title=A preliminary study on the use of (10)Be in forensic radioecology of nuclear explosion sites|volume=99|issue=2|pages=260–70 |pmid=17904707|journal=Journal of environmental radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotope &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots much like &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be has a very short half-life of about 7{{e|-17}} s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=R.

The [[British (people)|British]] [[astronomer]] Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] first showed that the energy levels of &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C allow carbon production by the so-called [[triple-alpha process]] in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available, thus making creation of [[carbon-based life]] possible from the gas and dust ejected by [[supernova]]s (see also [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=PXGWGnPPo0gC&amp;pg=PA223|page=223|title=Supernovae and nucleosynthesis|author=Arnett, David |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=0691011478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innermost electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be decays by [[electron capture]], it does so by taking electrons from [[atomic orbital]]s that may participate in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its electron configuration&amp;nbsp;– a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html|title = How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates|first = Bill|last = Johnson|publisher = University of California, Riverside|accessdate = 2008-03-30 |year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Be which decays through [[neutron emission]]. It has a half-life of 2.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Hammond, C.

Unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but these do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium was created when [[cosmic rays]] induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ILQ7sTrRixMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA172|page=172|title=Physics: 1981–1990|author=Ekspong, G.

===Occurrence===
[[File:Beryllium OreUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Beryllium ore]]
{{Category see also|Beryllium minerals}}
The beryllium concentration in the Earth's surface rocks is ca. 4–6 parts per million (ppm). Beryllium is a major constituent of about 100 out of some 4000 known [[mineral]]s, the most important of which are [[bertrandite]] (Be&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[beryl]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chrysoberyl]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[phenakite]] (Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Production==
Because of its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed, the extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process. [[Electrolysis]] of a mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century, the metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the [[alkali metals]]. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of [[beryllium iodide]] was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of [[zirconium]], but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08827508808952633|title=Beryllium Extraction&amp;nbsp;– A Review|year=1988|author=Babu, R. S.|journal=Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review|volume=4|pages=39|last2=Gupta|first2=C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as [[beryllium chloride]] with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified [[magnesium]]. The price on the American market for [[Casting (metalworking)|vacuum-cast]] beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/|title = Beryllium Statistics and Information|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical equation for the key reaction is as follows:

:BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Mg → MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Be

The mining and production of beryllium is dominated by one American company, [[Brush Engineered Materials|Brush Wellman Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brushelmore.com/history.asp|title = Brush Wellman – Elmore, Ohio Plant :: Company History|accessdate = 2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This company smelts its beryllium ore, which contains the mineral [[bertrandite]], and which comes mostly from the company-owned Spor Mountain deposit in the [[State of Utah]]. The smelting and other refining of the beryllium is carried out at a factory just north of [[Delta, Utah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spor&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1998/ofr-98-0524/SPORMTN.HTM|title = Slides of the fluorspar, beryllium, and uranium deposits at Spor Mountain, Utah |first = David A.|last = Lindsey|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 [[tonne]]s, of which 176 tonnes (88%) came from the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSMCS2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/100300.pdf|title = Commodity Summary 2000: Beryllium |publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSMCS2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/mcs-2010-beryl.pdf|title = Commodity Summary 2000: Beryllium |publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Beryllium metal is located above aluminium in the electrochemical series and therefore is expected to show significant chemical activity; however, it is passivated by an oxide layer and does not react with air or water even at [[red heat]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of [[beryllium oxide]] and [[beryllium nitride]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt; Beryllium dissolves readily in non-[[oxidizing acid]]s, such as HCl and diluted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but not in [[nitric acid]] as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium, again similarly to aluminium, dissolves in warm alkali metals to form the beryllate anion, Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and hydrogen gas.

[[File:BeHydrolysis.png|thumb|Beryllium hydrolysis as a function of pH&lt;/br&gt;Water molecules attached to Be are omitted]]
The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In beryllium compounds the two electrons are lost and beryllium is in the +2 [[oxidation state]]; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in [[beryllium dichloride|BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wiberg, Egon; Holleman, Arnold Frederick|year=2001|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0123526515}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small [[atomic radius]] leads to significant [[Covalent bond|covalent]] character in beryllium's bonding.&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt; Beryllium is 4-fold coordinated in virtually all of its derivatives, e.g. [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and tetrahaloberyllates, BeX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using [[EDTA]] as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral complexes]]&amp;nbsp;– thus absorbing other cations such as Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; which might interfere – for example, in the [[Liquid-liquid extraction|solvent extraction]] of a complex formed between Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[acetylacetone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Determination of a trace amount of beryllium in water samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after preconcentration and separation as a beryllium-acetylacetonate complex on activated carbon|author=Okutani, T.; Tsuruta, Y.; Sakuragawa, A. |journal=Anal.

Solutions of beryllium salts, e.g. [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[beryllium nitrate]], are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion.

Other products of hydrolysis include the [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]]ic ion [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Beryllium hydroxide]], Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, that is at biological pH. It is [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] and dissolves in strongly [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] solutions.

Beryllium forms [[binary compound]]s with many non-metals. [[Anhydrous]] [[halide]]s are known for F, Cl, Br and I. [[beryllium fluoride|BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] has a [[silica]]-like structure with corner-shared BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. [[beryllium chloride|BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[beryllium bromide|BeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra.

[[Beryllium oxide]], BeO, is a white [[refractory]] solid, which has the [[zinc sulfide|wurtzite]] crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is [[amphoteric]].

==History==
Early analyses of [[emerald]]s and [[beryl]]s &lt;!--by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Torbern Olof Bergman]], [[Franz Karl Achard]], and Johann Jakob Bindheim--&gt; always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are [[aluminium silicate]]s. [[René Just Haüy]] discovered that both crystals show strong similarities, and he asked the [[chemist]] [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] for a chemical analysis. Vauquelin was able to separate the aluminium from the beryllium by dissolving the [[aluminium hydroxide]] in an additional [[alkali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Annales de Chimie|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA155|pages = 155–169| first = Louis-Nicolas|last = Vauquelin|title = De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre| year = 1798| issue = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vauquelin named the new element &quot;glucinum&quot; for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira |year = 1933|title = The Discovery of the Elements |publisher = Journal of Chemical Education |location = Easton, PA |chapter = XII.

The potassium itself had been produced by the [[electrolysis]] of its compounds, a newly-discovered process. This chemical method yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered. The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] by [[Paul Lebeau]] in 1898 resulted in the first pure samples of beryllium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt; It took until [[World War I]] (1914–18) before significant amounts of beryllium were produced, but large-scale production was not started until early 1930s. It saw a rapid increase during [[World War II]], due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper [[alloy]]s and [[phosphor]]s for [[fluorescent light]]s. In the first years, most fluorescent lamps used [[zinc orthosilicate]] with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium [[tungstate]] improved the blue part of the spectrum yielding acceptable white. After it was discovered that beryllium was toxic, halophosphate-based phosphors took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=klE5qGAltjAC&amp;pg=PA98|page = 98|title = Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress|isbn = 9780881733785|author1 = Kane, Raymond|author2 = Sell, Heinz|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Early usage of the word ''beryllium'' can be traced to many languages, including [[Latin]] ''Beryllus''; French ''Béry''; [[Greek language|Greek]] ''βήρυλλος'', ''bērullos'', ''beryl''; [[Prakrit]] ''veruliya'' (वॆरुलिय‌); [[Pāli]] ''veḷuriya'' (वेलुरिय), ''veḷiru'' (भेलिरु) or ''viḷar'' (भिलर्) – &quot;to become pale,&quot; in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the [[Sanskrit]] word वैडूर्य vaidurya-, which is of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin and could be derived from the name of the modern city of [[Belur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|beryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as {{anchor|Glucinium}} '''glucinum''' or '''glucinium''' (with the accompanying chemical symbol &quot;'''Gl'''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Black, The MacMillian Company, New York, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;), the name coming from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for sweet: γλυκυς, due to the sweet taste of beryllium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].

==Applications==
It is estimated that most beryllium is used for military applications, so information is not readily available.&lt;ref&gt;Petzow, Günter ''et al.'' &quot;Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_011.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation windows===

[[File:Be foil square.jpg|thumb|right|A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an [[X-ray microscope]]. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low [[atomic number]].]]
Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of Be to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of [[synchrotron]] radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

Low [[atomic number]] also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic [[Elementary particle|particles]]. Therefore it is used to build the [[beamline|beam pipe]] around the collision region in [[particle physics]] setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[LHCb]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Installation and commissioning of vacuum systems for the LHC particle detectors|publisher = CERN|first1 =R.|last1 = Veness|first2 =D.|last2 =Ramos|first3 =P.|last3 =Lepeule|first4 =A.|last4 = Rossi|first5 =G.|last5 =Schneider|first6 =S.|last6 =Blanchard|url = http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1199583/files/CERN-ATS-2009-005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tevatron]] and the [[SLAC]]. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above [[absolute zero]], and its [[diamagnetic]] nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and [[strong focusing|focus]] the [[particle beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)01149-4|title=A new inner vertex detector for STAR|year=2001|author=Wieman, H|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section a Accelerators Spectrometers Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=473|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical applications===
Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and [[aerospace]] industries in high-speed [[aircraft]], [[missile]]s, [[space vehicle]]s and [[communication satellite]]s. Several [[liquid-fuel rocket]]s use [[rocket engine nozzle|nozzles]] of pure beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC&amp;pg=PA690| title = Metals handbook|chapter = Beryllium|first = Joseph R.|last = Davis|publisher = ASM International|year = 1998|isbn = 9780871706546|pages = 690–691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6fdmMuj0rNEC&amp;pg=PA62|page=62|title=Encyclopedia of materials, parts, and finishes|author=Schwartz, Mel M. |publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=1566766613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium is used as an [[alloy]]ing agent in the production of [[beryllium copper]], which contains up to 2.5% beryllium. Beryllium-copper alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of high [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]], high strength and [[hardness (materials science)|hardness]], nonmagnetic properties, along with good [[corrosion]] and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance. These applications include the making of [[spot welding]] electrodes, [[Spring (device)|springs]], non-sparking tools and [[electrical contact]]s.

The excellent elastic rigidity of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in [[gyroscope]] [[inertial guidance]] systems and in support structures for optical systems.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in Jason pistols, which were used to strip paint from the hulls of ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=2009-08-08|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Defence-forces-face-rare-toxic-metal-exposure-risk/2005/02/01/1107228681666.html|title=Defence forces face rare toxic metal exposure risk|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier major application of beryllium was in [[brake]]s for military aircraft because of its hardness, high melting point and exceptional [[heat dissipation]]. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

===Mirrors===
Beryllium [[mirror]]s are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a [[honeycomb mirror|honeycomb support structure]], are used, for example, in [[meteorological satellite]]s where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in [[control system|optical guidance]] systems and in [[fire-control system]]s, e.g. in the German-made [[Leopard 1]] and [[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]s. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard [[electroless nickel plating]] which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to [[cryogenic]] operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

The [[James Webb Space Telescope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html|title = Beryllium related details from NASA|accessdate = 2008-09-18|publisher =NASA |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529052057/http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass—and remains more uniform—in such temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The James Webb Space Telescope|first = Jonathan P.|last = Gardner|year = 2007|journal = Poceedings of Science|url = http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/052/005/MRU_005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the optics of the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] are entirely built of beryllium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Spitzer Space Telescope Mission|first = M.

R.|last9 = Brandl|first9 = B.|bibcode=2004ApJS..154....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic applications===
Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium are used by naval or military [[explosive ordnance disposal]] teams for work on or near [[naval mine]]s, since these mines commonly have [[fuze|magnetic fuze]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0263919|title=The selection of low-magnetic alloys for EOD tools|publisher= Naval Weapons Plant Washington DC|author= Kojola, Kenneth ; Lurie, William|date=9 August 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EqtlqFNkWwQC&amp;pg=PT891|page=891|title=Understanding anesthesia equipment|author=Dorsch, Jerry A. and Dorsch, Susan E.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=0781776031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[radio communication]]s and powerful (usually military) [[radar]]s, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic [[klystron]]s, [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling wave tube]]s, etc., that are used for generating high levels of [[microwave]] power in the [[transmitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=MobileReference|title=Electronics Quick Study Guide for Smartphones and Mobile Devices|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AG6H633VIAcC&amp;pg=PT2396|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=9781605011004|pages=2396–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear applications===
Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in [[nuclear weapon design]]s as the very outer layer of the [[plutonium pit]]s in the primary stages of [[thermonuclear bomb]]s, placed to surround the [[fissile]] material. These layers of beryllium are good &quot;pushers&quot; for the [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium-239]], and they are also good [[neutron reflector]]s, just as they are in beryllium-moderated [[nuclear reactors]].&lt;ref name=weapons/&gt;

Beryllium is also commonly used as a [[neutron source]] in laboratory experiments in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a [[radio-isotope]] such as [[polonium]]-210, [[radium]]-226, [[plutonium]]-239, or [[americium]]-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus are [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction than the alpha particle was heading. Such neutron sources, named [[Modulated neutron initiator|&quot;urchin&quot;]] neutron initiators, were used some in early [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=weapons&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|page=35|title=How nuclear weapons spread|author=Barnaby, Frank |publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0415076749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium is also used at the [[Joint European Torus]] [[nuclear fusion|nuclear-fusion research laboratory]], and it will be used in the more advanced [[ITER]] to condition the components which face the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9ngHTkC8hG8C&amp;pg=PA15|page=15|title=Nuclear fusion research|author=Clark, R. E. H.; Reiter, D.|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=3540230386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium has also been proposed as a [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] material for [[nuclear fuel rod]]s, owing to its good combination of mechanical, chemical and nuclear properties.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture [[FLiBe]], which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical [[molten salt reactor]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2005.08.101|title = JUPITER-II molten salt Flibe research: An update on tritium, mobilization and redox chemistry experiments|year = 2006|last1 = Petti|first1 = D|last2 = Smolik|first2 = G|last3 = Simpson|first3 = M|last4 = Sharpe|first4 = J|last5 = Anderl|first5 = R|last6 = Fukada|first6 = S|last7 = Hatano|first7 = Y|last8 = Hara|first8 = M|last9 = Oya|first9 = Y|journal = Fusion Engineering and Design|volume = 81|pages = 1439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustics===
Low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency [[speaker driver]]s. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than [[titanium]]), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium [[tweeter]]s are limited to high-end home, [[pro audio]] and [[public address]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/speaker-product-reviews/speakers/usher-be-718-bookshelf-speakers-with-beryllium-tweeters.html|first = John E.|last = Johnson, Jr.|date = 2007-11-12|accessdate = 2008-09-18|title = Usher Be-718 Bookshelf Speakers with Beryllium Tweeters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.focalprofessional.com/en/technologies/index.php#tabs-2|accessdate = 2010-07-10|title = Beryllium use in pro audio Focal speakers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.krksys.com/product_expose.php |publisher = KRK Systems|accessdate = 2009-02-12|title = Exposé E8B studio monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; More often, beryllium is [[alloy]]ed with other metals, which is sometimes not disclosed for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.electrofusionproducts.com/userfiles/China_Be_Domes_Report.pdf|first = Mark|last = Svilar|date = 2004-01-08|accessdate = 2009-02-13|title = Analysis of &quot;Beryllium&quot; Speaker Dome and Cone Obtained from China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic===
Beryllium is a [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopant]] in [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V compound semiconductors]]. It is widely used in materials such as [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]], [[AlGaAs]], [[InGaAs]] and [[InAlAs]] grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oJs6nK3TZrwC&amp;pg=PA104|page=104|title=High-power diode lasers|author=Diehl, Roland |publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=3540666931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for [[printed circuit board]]s in [[surface-mount technology]]. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and [[heat sink]]. The application also requires a coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] that is well matched to the [[alumina]] and [[glass-reinforced plastic|polyimide-glass]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s. The beryllium-beryllium oxide [[metal matrix composite|composite]] &quot;[[E-Material]]s&quot; have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

[[Beryllium oxide]] is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an [[electrical insulator]] and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in [[power semiconductor device|high-power]] [[transistor]]s in [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]]s for [[telecommunication]]s. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the [[thermal conductivity]] of [[uranium dioxide]] [[nuclear fuel]] pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Exposures and Patterns of Disease in the Beryllium Industry|title=in Beryllium: Its Industrial Hygiene Aspects|editor=Stokinger, HE |publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Beryllium poisoning}}
The toxicity of beryllium depends upon the duration, intensity and frequency of exposure (features of dose), as well as the form of beryllium and the route of exposure (e.g., inhalation, dermal, ingestion). According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), beryllium and beryllium compounds are [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Category 1 carcinogens]]; they are carcinogenic to both animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol58/mono58-1.html|publisher = International Agency for Research on Cancer|title = IARC Monograph, Volume 58|year = 1993|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic [[berylliosis]] is a [[pulmonary]] and [[systemic circulation|systemic]] [[granuloma]]tous disease caused by exposure to beryllium. Acute beryllium disease in the form of [[chemical pneumonitis]] was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. Cases of chronic berylliosis were first described in 1946 among workers in plants manufacturing [[fluorescent lamp]]s in [[Massachusetts]]. Chronic berylliosis resembles [[sarcoidosis]] in many respects, and the [[differential diagnosis]] is often difficult. It occasionally killed early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as [[Herbert L. Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.atomicarchive.com/Photos/CP1/image5.shtml|title = Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946|date = 2006-06-19|publisher = Office of Public Affairs, Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust ([[lung cancer]] is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in [[fluorescent light]]ing tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc106.htm |title=Berrylium: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CRITERIA 106 |author=International Programme On Chemical Safety |year= 1990 |work= |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute [[ammonium bifluoride]] for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7458.htm|title=ASTM D7458&amp;nbsp;–08|accessdate=2009-08-08|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1520/JAI13168|title=Development of a New Fluorescence Method for the Detection of Beryllium on Surfaces|year=2005|last1=Minogue|first1 =EM|last2=Ehler|first2=DS|last3=Burrell|first3=AK|last4= McCleskey|first4=TM|last5=Taylor|first5=TP|journal=Journal of ASTM International|volume=2|pages=13168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born {{nowrap|December 2,}} 1981) is an American recording artist and entertainer. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], Spears began performing as a child, landing acting roles in stage productions and television shows. She signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 and released her debut album ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' in 1999. During her first decade within the music industry, she became a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, followed by a much-publicized personal life. Her first two albums established her as a pop icon and broke sales records, while title tracks &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot; and &quot;[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]&quot; became international number-one hits. Spears was credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s.

In 2001, she released her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' and expanded her brand, playing the starring role in the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' released in 2003, which yielded chart-topping singles &quot;[[Me Against the Music]]&quot;, &quot;[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]&quot; and &quot;[[Everytime]]&quot;. After the release of two compilation albums, Spears experienced personal struggles and her career went under hiatus. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', was released in 2007 and despite receiving little promotion, it spawned hits &quot;[[Gimme More]]&quot; and &quot;[[Piece of Me]]&quot;. In 2008, her erratic behaviour and hospitalizations caused her to be placed in a [[conservatorship]]. The same year, her sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' was released, with the global chart-topping lead single &quot;[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]&quot;. After embarking on [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]], she released greatest hits ''[[The Singles Collection (Britney Spears album)|The Singles Collection]]'', which featured U.S. and Canadian number-one single &quot;[[3 (song)|3]]&quot;. In 2011, Spears returned with her seventh studio album, titled [[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|''Femme Fatale'']], which was released on March 29, 2011, including the lead single &quot;[[Hold It Against Me]]&quot; which has become Spears' fourth U.S. number-one single.&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/britneyspears/status/32834435023904768|title=Spears announces new album title on Twitter | Twitter.com|date=2011-02-02|accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard1&quot;&gt;Sanger, Gary T.

==Biography==
===1981–97: Early life and career beginnings===
Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981, the second child of [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene]] (née Bridges) and James Parnell Spears. She is of [[English American|English]] heritage through her maternal grandmother, who was born in [[London]], and of distant [[Maltese people|Maltese]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056674/EXCLUSIVE-First-photos-Britney-Spears-newly-discovered-British-family.html|title=Exclusive: First photos of Britney Spears' newly-discovered British family|publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=2008-09-17|accessdate=2010-06-04|last=Thomas|first=Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her siblings are Bryan James and [[Jamie Lynn Spears|Jamie Lynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age three, she started to attend dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform a solo at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended [[gymnastics]] and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rs1&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=1999-04-15|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=2010-06-04|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography&amp;nbsp;— Celebrity Gossip | Entertainment News | Arts And Entertainment&amp;nbsp;— FOXNews.com|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=2008-07-31|accessdate=2010-06-06|last=Reporter|first=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing &quot;[[What Child Is This?]]&quot; at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, &quot;I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age&quot;.&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt; At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]] for an audition in the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Cassella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a [[New York City]] talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role, as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'', as well as being cast in a number of commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, she was finally cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', but returned to Kentwood after the show was cancelled. She enrolled at [[Parklane Academy]] in nearby [[McComb, Mississippi]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to &quot;the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rs2&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It : Rolling Stone|date=2000-05-25|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=2010-06-05|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional [[demo (music)|demo]]. He sent Spears an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears travelled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and &quot;there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]].&quot; Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior vice president of [[A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that &quot;It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt; They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from &quot;lower and less poppy&quot; delivery to &quot;distinctively, unmistakably Britney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned &quot;[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary&quot; but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since &quot;It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.&quot; She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], among others.&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt;

===1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again''===

After Spears returned to the United States, Spears embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her forthcoming album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [['N Sync]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut album, ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 1999. It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over ten million copies in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt; The [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;/&gt; The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], topping the chart for two consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; later received a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/grammys.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 42nd Annual Grammy Awards - 2000|work=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|publisher=RockOntheNet.com|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everyhit.com/record4.html|title=Record-Breakers and Trivia&amp;nbsp;— everyHit.com|work=|publisher=Everyhit.com|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would later become the [[UK Million-Selling Singles|25th most successful song of all time in British chart history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everyhit.com/bestsellingsingles.html|title=everyHit.com&amp;nbsp;— Best Selling Singles Of All Time|work=|publisher=Everyhit.com|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country.&lt;ref name=ukchart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/BRITNEY%20SPEARS/|title=Britney Spears&amp;nbsp;— The Official Charts Company|work=Theofficialcharts.com|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]&quot; was released as the third single from the album.

On January 3, 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], after police that arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an illicit substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. On January 31, 2008, Spears was committed to the psychiatric ward of [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] and put on [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)|5150 involuntary psychiatric hold]].

David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' observed &quot;Christina Aguilera may flash skin and belly button, but in her music and manner, she's too eager not to offend&amp;nbsp;— she's a good girl pretending to be bad. Spears, however, comes across as a bad girl acting good&amp;nbsp;...

While writing the review for ''Femme Fatale'' in 2011, Adam Markovitz of [[Entertainment Weekly]] commented on the cultural significance of Spears' voice and music. &quot;We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer...we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's &quot;Toxic&quot; and the candied funk of 2000's &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again.&quot; Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as [[Michael Jackson]]'s yips or [[Eminem]]'s snarls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20475684,00.html|title=Music Review: Femme Fatale|last=Markovitz|first=Adam|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2011|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other dance-oriented pop stars, it has been widely reported that Spears [[lip-sync]]s in concert. Author Gary Giddins wrote in his book ''Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books'' (2006) that &quot;among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are Britney Spears, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Shania Twain, [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], and Madonna.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=288|year=2006|isbn=9780195179514|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashod D. Ollison of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' observes: &quot;Many pop stars&amp;nbsp;... feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement. Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won't pay up to $300 for a concert ticket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ollison|first=Rashod|title=The pressure to be perfect singing live ; Audiences expect CD-quality sound; Observation|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=1.C|date=October 26, 2004|issn=19308965|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giddins adds, &quot;it was reported Britney Spears fans prefer her to lip-sync—despite her denials of doing so (contradicted by her own director)—because they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddins&quot;/&gt; In Australia, NSW Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge has advised disclaimers be printed on any ticket for concerts which contain any prerecorded vocals. She commented: &quot;There could have been some instances where people actually go and purchase a ticket thinking that they're going to have a live performance ... for some people that means that everything is live, it's fresh, it happens instantaneously, it's not something that's been pre-recorded.

===Influences===
Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Janet Jackson, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence, citing both as influences in her work. She has also named [[Michael Jackson]] as a source of inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;shane&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harrison|first=Shane|title='Britney' strengthens claim to pop tiara|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|page=C.1|date=November 6, 2001|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spears: &quot;I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was, you know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Masley|first=Ed|title=The State of Britneydom: Teen-pop Queen declares 'I'm on the verge of being a woman'|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=W.22|date=November 2, 2001|issn=1068624X|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2002 book ''Madonnastyle'' by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: &quot;I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl.

I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clerk | first = Carol | title = Madonnastyle | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 2002 | page = 56 | isbn = 9780711988743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics have argued that Spears should not be considered in the same league of talent as Jackson or Madonna. Journalists Erika Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard of the ''[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]'' observed &quot;[s]ome may argue that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UWIRE&quot;/&gt; However, in examining her level of skill as an artist, it is questioned that &quot;[a]lthough she has been classified among female elites such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, what does Ms. Spears really have in common with these divas of rock?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UWIRE&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Montalvo|first1=Erika|last2=Sheppard|first2=Jackie|title=CONCERT REVIEW: Pop's princess still reigns ... for now|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]|publisher=[[UWIRE]]|date=November 16, 2001|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Anderman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' remarked that &quot;[t]hirteen costume changes in 90 minutes won't bless her with Madonna's intelligence or cultural barometer. An army of cutting-edge R&amp;B producers won't supply her with Janet Jackson's sense of humor or sincere smile&amp;nbsp;... Britney's heroes aren't great singers. But they're real singers. Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Anderman|first=Joan|title=BENEATH HER SEXY GROWLS, A GIRLHOOD INTERRUPTED|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|page=D.1|date=December 7, 2001|issn=07431791|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporter Ed Bumgardner commented her transition from teen pop start to adult sex symbol with her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' &quot;takes its cues from two other successful performers—Madonna and Janet Jackson—both of whom she brazenly rips off and both of whom, like Spears, are passable singers, at best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bumgardner |first=Ed|title=CONFUSED: WOMAN OR A GIRL? SPEARS CAN'T DECIDE|newspaper=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|page=1|date=November 9, 2001|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Shane Harrison wrote: &quot;From the minimalist thump and &quot;[[Nasty (song)|Nasty]]&quot; feel of &quot;[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]&quot; to the scattered quotes in &quot;[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]&quot;, [''Britney''] feels like [Spears's] attempt at '[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shane&quot;/&gt; Citing Jackson's resolve to incorporate personal and social issues into her work and Madonna's ability to constantly redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable material in the industry, Spears's catalog ultimately pales in comparison, because &quot;[w]hile Jackson and Madonna wrote their own music about subjects of importance, [Spears's] music sounds like an upbeat version of either, 'I want to grow up but the media won't let me,' or 'Here kitty, kitty, I'm wearing my underwear outside of my leather pants'-type ballads.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UWIRE&quot;/&gt; In contrast, Guy Blackman argues that although &quot;no one would argue that Spears is some kind of pioneering pop auteur, there’s still a lot to like about her back catalogue. During her world-conquering peak, she was just about as cutting edge as you could get in the world of global pop superstardom. Spears didn’t just work with big names, she gave big names their names, and maintained her high currency in the world’s most fickle industry for years, when most aspiring starlets are lucky to manage months.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age&quot;/&gt;

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: &quot;she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Elysa Gardner|title=Luscious Jackson|newspaper=USA Today|date=2000-07-28|page=1.E|issn=07347456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's respect for Spears has also been a subject of observation. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of ''Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983-2003'' (2004) note that the most well known cross-generational relationship exists between Spears and Madonna in which &quot;the entertainment newsmedia almost became obsessed with their relationship of mutual admiration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MDW&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hernández|first=Santiago|coauthors=Freya Jarman-Ivens|title=Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983-2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=162|year=2004|isbn=9780754633723|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biographers also report &quot;[s]ome observers of popular culture, however, feel that the comparisons between the two artist are meaningless and fail to recognize Madonna's unique contribution: Madonna was never 'just another pop star' whereas Britney can more easily be seen as a standard manufactured pop act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MDW&quot;/&gt;

Bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the east, Brazil has a coastline of over {{km to mi|7491|abbrev=yes|precision=0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Geo&quot;/&gt; It is bordered on the north by [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and the [[France|French]] overseas department of [[French Guiana]]; on the northwest by [[Colombia]]; on the west by [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]; on the southwest by [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] and on the south by [[Uruguay]].

Brazil was a colony of [[Portugal]] from the landing of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in 1500 until 1815, when it was elevated to United Kingdom with Portugal and Algarves. The colonial bond was in fact broken in 1808, when the capital of the Portuguese Kingdom was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, after Napoleon invaded Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Introduction of Brazil | booktitle = The World Factbook | publisher = Central Intelligence Agency | year = 2008 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html | accessdate = 2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The independence from Portugal was achieved in 1822. Initially independent as the [[Empire of Brazil]], the country has been a [[republic]] since 1889, although the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, now called [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]], dates back to 1824, when the first constitution was ratified.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Intro&quot;/&gt; Its current [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] defines Brazil as a [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Brazilian Federal Constitution | publisher = Presidency of the Republic | year = 1988 | url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm | language = Portuguese | accessdate = 2008-06-03 }} {{cite web | title = Brazilian Federal Constitution | publisher = v-brazil.com | year = 2007 | url = http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html | quote = Unofficial translate | accessdate = 2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation is formed by the union of the [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]], the 26 [[States of Brazil|States]], and the 5,564 [[Municipalities of Brazil|Municipalities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Territorial units of the municipality level | publisher = Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics | year = 2008 | url = http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/territorio/tabunit.asp?n=6&amp;t=2&amp;z=t&amp;o=4 | language = Portuguese | accessdate = 2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Brazil}}
The [[etymology]] of Brazil remains unclear. Traditionally, the word &quot;Brazil&quot; comes from [[brazilwood]], a timber tree that many sailors traded from Brazilian regions to [[Europe]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuenoTrintaSeis&quot;&gt;{{Pt}} Eduardo Bueno, ''Brasil: uma História'' (São Paulo: Ática, 2003; ISBN 8508082134), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese brazilwood is called ''pau-brasil'', with the word ''brasil'' commonly given the etymology &quot;red like an ember,&quot; formed from [[Latin]] ''brasa'' (&quot;ember&quot;) and the suffix ''-il'' (from ''-iculum'' or ''-ilium'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/brésil CNRTL] - Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/portugues/index.php?lingua=portugues-portugues&amp;palavra=brasil Michaelis] - Moderno Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulete.uol.com.br/site.php?mdl=aulete_digital&amp;op=loadVerbete&amp;pesquisa=1&amp;palavra=brasil iDicionário Aulete] {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is taught as official in schools of Brazil and [[Portugal]].

However, the Brazilian scholar José Adelino da Silva Azevedo has postulated that the word is much older, either of [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Phoenicia]]n origin. The Phoenicians traded a red dye extracted from a mineral mined in Celtic lands, from [[Iberia]] to [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Pt}} &quot;[http://www.enciclopedia.com.pt/articles.php?article_id=486 República Federativa do Brasil].&quot; Consulted on October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Irish mythology]] there is a Western island called [[Hy-Brazil]], and this is seen by some, including Tolkien,&lt;ref name=&quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;&gt;[Tolkien, J.

The land now called Brazil was claimed by Portugal in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p. 98&quot;&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese encountered [[Stone Age|stone age]] natives divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the [[Tupi–Guarani]] family, and fought among themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;100&quot;&gt;Boxer, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively begun in 1534, when [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] [[John III of Portugal|João III]] divided the territory into twelve hereditary captaincies,&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27&quot;&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; but this arrangement proved problematic and in 1549 the king assigned a [[Governor-General]] to administer the entire colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;108&lt;/ref&gt; while others were enslaved or exterminated in long wars or by European diseases to which they had no immunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;102&quot;&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;30, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-16th century, sugar had become Brazil's most important export&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Portuguese imported African slaves&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; to cope with the increasing international [[demand (economics)|demand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|left|The first Christian mass in Brazil, 1500.]]
Through wars against the French, the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory to the southeast, taking [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1567, and to the northwest, taking [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, pp.&amp;nbsp;80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; They sent military expeditions to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon rainforest]] and conquered British and Dutch strongholds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/wic.html Facsimiles of multiple original documents] relating about the events in Brazil in the 17th century that led to a Dutch influence and their final defeat&lt;/ref&gt; founding villages and forts from 1669.&lt;ref&gt;Calmon, p.&amp;nbsp;294.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1680 they reached the far south and founded [[Colonia del Sacramento|Sacramento]] on the bank of the [[Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]], in the Eastern Strip region (present-day [[Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 17th century, sugar exports started to decline&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; but beginning in the 1690s, the discovery of gold by [[Bandeirantes|explorers]] in the region that would later be called [[Minas Gerais]] (General Mines) in current [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Goiás]], saved the colony from imminent collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, pp.&amp;nbsp;168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; From all over Brazil, as well as from Portugal, thousands of immigrants came to the mines.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish tried to prevent Portuguese expansion into the territory that belonged to them according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494 Treaty of Tordesillas]], and succeeded in conquering the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Strip]] in 1777. However, this was in vain as the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], signed in the same year, confirmed Portuguese sovereignty over all lands proceeding from its territorial expansion, thus creating most of the current Brazilian borders.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808, the Portuguese royal family, fleeing the troops of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I]] that were invading Portugal and most of Central Europe, [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|established themselves]] in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which thus became the seat of the entire [[Portuguese Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213&quot;&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815 [[John VI of Portugal|Dom João VI]], then regent on behalf of his incapacitated mother, elevated Brazil from colony to sovereign [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom united with Portugal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213&quot;/&gt; In 1809 the Portuguese invaded [[French Guiana]] (which was returned to France in 1817)&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;145.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1816 the Eastern Strip, subsequently renamed [[Cisplatina]]&lt;ref&gt;Calmon (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; (but Brazil [[Argentina-Brazil War|lost it in 1828]] when it became an independent nation known as [[Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barman (1999), pp.18, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence and Empire===
{{Main|Brazilian Independence|Empire of Brazil}}
King [[John VI of Portugal|João VI]] returned to Europe on 26 April 1821, leaving his elder son Prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro de Alcântara]] as regent to rule Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;109–110&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese government attempted to turn Brazil into a colony once again, thus depriving it of its achievements since 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;117–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilians refused to yield and Prince Pedro stood by them declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;150–153&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 1822, Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil and crowned [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] on 1 December 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Vianna, p.&amp;nbsp;418&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Independência ou Morte.jpg|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Brazilian independence]] by Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] on 7 September 1822.]]

At that time most Brazilians were in favour of a monarchy and [[republicanism]] had little support.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kraay ''apud'' Lorenzo Aldé, ''Revista de História da Biblioteca Nacional,'' issue 50, year 5 (Rio de Janeiro: SABIN, 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, ''O Brasil Monárquico: o processo de emancipação'', 4th ed. (São Paulo: Difusão Européia do Livro, 1976), p.&amp;nbsp;403&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Brazilian War of Independence]] spread through almost the entire territory, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions.&lt;ref&gt;Diégues 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;168, 164, 178&lt;/ref&gt; The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824&lt;ref&gt;Diégues 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–180&lt;/ref&gt; and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first Brazilian constitution was promulgated on 25 March 1824, after its acceptance by the municipal councils across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Vianna, p.&amp;nbsp;140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Murilo de Carvalho, ''A Monarquia brasileira'' (Rio de Janeiro: Ao Livro Técnico, 1993), p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calmon (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vainfas, p.&amp;nbsp;170&quot;&gt;Vainfas, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt; Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and went to Europe to [[Liberal Wars|reclaim his daughter’s crown]], leaving behind his five year old son and heir, who was to become [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyra (v.1), p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt; As the new emperor could not exert his constitutional prerogatives until he reached maturity, a [[regent|regency]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes between political factions led to rebellions and an unstable, almost anarchical, regency.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Dohlnikoff, ''Pacto imperial: origens do federalismo no Brasil do século XIX'' (São Paulo: Globo, 2005), p.&amp;nbsp;206&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellious factions, however, were not in revolt against the monarchy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carvalho 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;43&quot;&gt;Carvalho (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Souza, p.&amp;nbsp;326&lt;/ref&gt; even though some declared the secession of the provinces as independent republics, but only so long as Pedro II was a minor.&lt;ref&gt;Janotti, pp.&amp;nbsp;171–172&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Pedro II was prematurely declared of age and &quot;Brazil was to enjoy nearly half a century of internal peace and rapid material progress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Munro, p.&amp;nbsp;273&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Americo-avaí.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian forces (in blue uniform) engage the Paraguayan army (some in red uniform and other shirtless) during the [[War of the Triple Alliance]].]]

Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II (the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], which left over 50,000 dead)&lt;ref&gt;Lyra (v.1), pp.&amp;nbsp;164, 225, 272&lt;/ref&gt; and witnessed the consolidation of [[representative democracy]], mainly due to successive [[election]]s and unrestricted [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;9, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, slavery was extinguished after a slow but steady process that began with the end of the international traffic in slaves in 1850&lt;ref&gt;Lyra (v.1), p.&amp;nbsp;166&lt;/ref&gt; and ended with the complete abolition of slavery in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Lyra (v.3), p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt; The slave population had been in decline since Brazil's independence: in 1823, 29% of the Brazilian population were slaves but by 1887 this had fallen to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Vainfas, p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt;

When the monarchy was overthrown on 15 November 1889&lt;ref name=&quot;Munro, p.&amp;nbsp;280&quot;/&gt; there was little desire in Brazil to change the [[form of government]]&lt;ref&gt;George Ermakoff, ''Rio de Janeiro – 1840–1900 – Uma crônica fotográfica'' (Rio de Janeiro: G. Ermakoff Casa Editorial, 2006), p.&amp;nbsp;189&lt;/ref&gt; and Pedro II was at the height of his popularity among his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, p.&amp;nbsp;444&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vainfas, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt; However, he &quot;bore prime, perhaps sole, responsibility for his own overthrow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barman (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;399&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his two sons, Pedro believed that &quot;the imperial regime was destined to end with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barman (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt; He cared little for the regime's fate&lt;ref&gt;Lyra (v.3), p.&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barman (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;361&lt;/ref&gt; and so neither did anything, nor allowed anyone else to do anything, to prevent the military coup, backed by former slave owners who resented the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Nostalgia Imperial'' (Rio de Janeiro: Topbooks, 1996), p.&amp;nbsp;194 – However, the monarchist reaction after the fall of the empire and the subsequent exile of the Imperial Family &quot;was not small and even less was its repression&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyra (v.3), p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, pp.&amp;nbsp;450, 457&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Republic===
{{Main|República Velha|Estado Novo (Brazil)|Brazilian Second Republic}}
[[File:Revolução de 1930.jpg|thumb|The Brazilian coup d'état of 1930 raised [[Getúlio Vargas]] (center with military uniform but no hat) to power. He would rule the country [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|for fifteen years]].]]
The &quot;early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship. The army dominated affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Munro, p.&amp;nbsp;280&quot;&gt;Munro, p.&amp;nbsp;280&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 the republican civilians rose to power, opening a &quot;prolonged cycle of civil war, financial disaster, and government incompetence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barman 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;403&quot;&gt;Barman (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;403&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902, the government began a return to the policies pursued during the Empire, policies that promised peace and order at home and a restoration of Brazil's prestige abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barman 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;403&quot;/&gt; and was successful in negotiating several treaties that expanded (with the purchase of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]) and secured the Brazilian boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Barman (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;404&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1920s the country was plagued by [[Tenente revolts|several rebellions]] caused by young military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, pp.&amp;nbsp;296–301&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930 the regime was weakened and demoralized, which allowed the defeated presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]] to lead a [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|coup d'état]] and assume the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;154&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas was supposed to assume the presidency temporarily but instead, he closed the National Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with [[State of emergency|emergency powers]] and replaced the states' governors with his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, pp.&amp;nbsp;328 and 331&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 [[Communism|Communists]] rebelled across the country and made an unsuccessful bid for power.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;249&lt;/ref&gt; The communist threat, however, served as an excuse for Vargas to launch another coup d'état in 1937 and Brazil became [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|a full dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;162&lt;/ref&gt; The repression of the opposition was brutal with more than 20,000 people imprisoned, [[Internment#Internment camps|internment camps]] created for political prisoners in distant regions of the country, widespread torture by the government agents of repression, and censorship of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil remained neutral during the early years of [[World War II]] until the government declared war against the [[Axis powers]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;272&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas then forced [[German Brazilian|German]], [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] and [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]] immigrants into [[Concentration camps|concentration camp]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Ana Maria in ''História Viva'' magazine, issue 67, year VI, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1944, [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|sent troops to the battlefields in Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, pp.&amp;nbsp;343–344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;173&lt;/ref&gt; With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;281&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy [[Brazilian Second Republic|was reinstated]] and General [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]] was elected president and took office in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;182–183&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas returned to power in 1951, this time democratically elected, but he was incapable of either governing under a democracy or of dealing with an active opposition, and he committed suicide in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, pp.&amp;nbsp;346–347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;188–194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary era===

[[File:Inauguration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2003.jpeg|thumb|The transition from [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]] revealed that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability.]]
Several brief interim governments succeeded after Vargas's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira|Juscelino Kubitscheck]] became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–203&lt;/ref&gt; The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;204&lt;/ref&gt; but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]], inaugurated in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt; His successor was [[Jânio Quadros]], who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt; His vice-president, [[João Goulart]], assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|deposed in April 1964 by a coup]] that resulted in a [[Brazilian military government|military regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;397&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime was intended to be transitory&lt;ref&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.&amp;nbsp;141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaspari p.35&quot;&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; The repression of the dictatorship's opponents, including urban guerrillas,&lt;ref&gt;Elio Gaspari, ''A ditadura escancarada'' (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 2002), p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; was harsh, but not as brutal as in other Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;239&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the extraordinary economic growth, known as an &quot;economic miracle&quot;, the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the years of repression.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;422&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Ernesto Geisel]] became president in 1974 and began his project of re-democratization through a process that he said would be &quot;slow, gradual and safe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;455.&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel ended the military indiscipline that had plagued the country since 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the torture of political prisoners, censorship of the press,&lt;ref&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, the dictatorship itself, after he extinguished the Fifth Institutional Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaspari p.35&quot;/&gt; However, the military regime continued, under his chosen successor General [[João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo|João Figueiredo]], to complete the transition to full democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;382.&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilians fully returned to power in 1985 when [[José Sarney]] assumed the presidency&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;460.&lt;/ref&gt; but, by the end of his term, he had become extremely unpopular due to the uncontrollable economic crisis and unusually high inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;464–465.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Fernando Collor]], who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;465, 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] as Minister of Finance.

Cardoso produced a highly successful [[Plano Real]] (Royal or Real Plan)&lt;ref&gt;The name of the current Brazilian currency came both from the Real Unity of Value (a transition currency) and from an [[Brazilian real#First real, 1690-1942|older currency that existed until 1942]]. In Portuguese it is called &quot;Real&quot;, meaning &quot;royal&quot;, as it originated in Portugal, then a monarchy (Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;311).&lt;/ref&gt; that granted stability to the Brazilian economy&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;482.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was elected as president in 1994 and again in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;474.&lt;/ref&gt; The peaceful transition of power to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]], who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;502.&lt;/ref&gt; Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president, [[Dilma Rousseff]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-31/world/brazil.elections_1_voting-machines-president-luiz-inacio-manaus?_s=PM:WORLD&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Geo&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes: [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial]], [[tropical climate|tropical]], [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]], [[tropical climate|highland tropical]], [[Temperateness|temperate]], and [[Subtropics|subtropical]]. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|equatorial rainforest]]s in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to [[temperate coniferous forest]]s in the south and [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savannas]] in central Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Brazil | work = Country Guide | publisher = BBC Weather | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT005220 | accessdate = 2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many regions have starkly different [[microclimate]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta 9&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Natural Regions | encyclopedia = Encarta | publisher = MSN | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554342_2/Brazil.html | accessdate = 2008-06-11 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQIOd3Z|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}} {{Dubious|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- tertiary source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BT&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Temperature in Brazil | publisher = Brazil Travel | url = http://www.v-brazil.com/information/geography/temperature-graphs.html | accessdate = 2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Brazil}}
[[File:Congresso Nacional.jpg|right|thumb|The [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] in [[Brasília]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of Brazil.]]
The Brazilian Federation is the &quot;indissoluble union&quot; of three distinct political entities: the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the &quot;spheres of government.&quot; The Federation is set on five fundamental principles:&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; [[sovereignty]], [[citizenship]], [[dignity]] of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]. The classic tripartite branches of government ([[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] under the [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]] system), is formally established by the Constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.

All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |title=Embassy of Brazil&amp;nbsp;— Ottawa |date= |quote=Political Institutions&amp;nbsp;— The Executive |accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/brazil_government.html |title=City Mayors |date= |quote=Brazil federal, state and local government |accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JSTOR |date= |quote=Brazilian Politics |jstor=196424)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt; Brazil has a [[multi-party system]] for most of its history. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT), [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB), and [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] (DEM). Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.

The form of government is that of a [[democracy|democratic]] republic, with a [[presidential system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; The president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of the Union and is [[elected]] for a four-year term,&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is [[Dilma Rousseff]] who was inaugurated on January 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2367025.stm &quot;Leftist Lula wins Brazil election&quot;] BBC News.

Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.

15 political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly. The largest political parties are the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT), Democrats (DEM), Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB-center), [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDB), Progressive Party (PP), Brazilian Labor Party (PTB), Liberal Party (PL), Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), Popular Socialist Party (PPS), Democratic Labor Party (PDT), and the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southtravels.com/america/brazil/government.html |title=Government – Brazil |publisher=Southtravels.com |date=1988-10-05 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{Main|Law of Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}
[[File:Supreme Federal Court of Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|Supreme Federal Court building at the Praça dos Três Poderes.]]
Brazilian law is based on [[Roman law|Roman]]-[[Germania|Germanic]] traditions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html &quot;The Brazilian Legal System&quot;], Organization of American States. Accessed 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.&lt;ref&gt;José Afonso da Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'' (Malheiros, 2004; ISBN 85-7420-559-1), p.&amp;nbsp; 46.&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2007, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'', p.&amp;nbsp; 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities and the Federal District have &quot;organic laws&quot; ({{lang|pt|''leis orgânicas''}}), which act in a similar way to constitutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/government_structure/loren/ &quot;Government structure&quot;]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} Brazilian Government. Accessed 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative entities are the main source of [[statute]]s, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]] allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Court]].

This system has been criticised over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Glugoski and Odete Medauar, &quot;[http://www.usp.br/jorusp/arquivo/2003/jusp667/pag0304.htm Nossos direitos nas suas mãos],&quot; [[University of São Paulo|USP]] Journal, 24–30 November 2003.

It is the oldest of the Brazilian armed forces and the only navy in Latin America to operate an aircraft carrier, the [[Brazilian aircraft carrier São Paulo (A12)|NAe São Paulo]] (formerly [[French aircraft carrier Foch (R99)|FS ''Foch'']] of the [[French Navy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mar.mil.br/menu_v/ccsm/perguntas/perguntas_mais_frequentes.htm#44.44|title=Perguntas|publisher=Marinha do Brasil|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force is the aerial warfare branch of the Brazilian armed forces, and the largest air force in Latin America, with about 700 manned aircraft in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fab.mil.br/portal/imprensa/fab_numeros.php|title=Sala de imprensa – FAB em números|publisher= Força Aérea Brasileira|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|States of Brazil|Municipalities of Brazil}}
{{See also|Regions of Brazil}}
{{Brazil Labelled Map|float=right}}
Brazil is a federation composed of 26 [[Federated state|States]], one [[Brazilian Federal District|federal district]] (which contains the capital city, [[Brasília]]) and municipalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the [[United States]]. For example, criminal and civil laws can only be voted by the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt;

The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]]. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the application of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constituição&quot;/&gt; Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called ''[[comarca]]'' (county).

The official language of Brazil is Portuguese,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA People&quot;/&gt; which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes.

[[Brazilian Portuguese]] has had its own development, influenced by the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian]] and [[Languages of Africa|African languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Portuguese&quot;/&gt; As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of [[Portugal]] and other Portuguese-speaking countries.

In 2008, the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an agreement on the reform of Portuguese into one international language, as opposed to two diverged dialects of the same language.

[[Image:BlackForest-Position.svg|thumb|A [[map]] of [[Germany]], showing the Black Forest in [[green]].]]
The '''Black Forest''' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Schwarzwald|Schwarzwald]]}}) is a [[forest|wooded]] [[mountain range]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], southwestern [[Germany]]. It is bordered by the [[Rhine]] valley to the west and south. The highest peak is the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898&amp;nbsp;ft). 
The region is almost rectangular with a length of {{km to mi|200|abbr=yes|precision=-1}} and breadth of {{km to mi|60|abbr=yes}}. Hence it has an area of approximately {{km2 to mi2|12000|abbr=yes|precision=-2}}.  The name ''Schwarzwald'', i.e. Black Forest, goes back to the Romans who referred to the thickly forested mountains there as ''Silva Nigra'' , i.e. &quot;Black Forest,&quot; because the dense growth of [[conifers]] in the forest blocked out most of the light inside the forest.

==Geology==
The Black Forest consists of a cover of [[sandstone]] on top of a core of [[gneiss]] and [[granite]]s. Formerly it shared tectonic evolution with the nearby [[Vosges Mountains]]. Later during the Middle [[Eocene]] a [[rifting]] period affected the area and caused formation of the [[Rhine graben]]. During the last [[glacial period]] of the [[Würm glaciation]], the Black Forest was covered by glaciers; several [[Tarn (lake)|tarns (or lakes)]] such as the [[Mummelsee]] are remains of this period.

==Rivers==
Rivers in the Black Forest include the [[Danube]] (which originates in the Black Forest as the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers), the [[Enz]], the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]], the [[Murg]], the [[Nagold River|Nagold]], the [[Neckar]], the [[Rench]], and the Wiese. The Black Forest is part of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[drainage basin]] (drained by the [[Rhine]]) and the [[Black Sea]] drainage basin (drained by the Danube).

==List of highest mountains==
* [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] ({{convert|1493|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Herzogenhorn]] ({{convert|1415|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Belchen]] ({{convert|1414|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Spiesshorn]] ({{convert|1349|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Schauinsland]] ({{convert|1284|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Kandel (Black Forest)|Kandel]] ({{convert|1241|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Hochblauen]] ({{convert|1165|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Hornisgrinde]] ({{convert|1164|m|abbr=on}})

==Political==
Administratively, the Black Forest belongs completely to the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and comprises the city of [[Pforzheim]] as well as the following districts (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]''). In the north: [[Enz (district)|Enz]], [[Rastatt (district)|Rastatt]] and [[Calw (district)|Calw]]; in the middle: [[Freudenstadt (district)|Freudenstadt]], [[Ortenaukreis]] and [[Rottweil (district)|Rottweil]]; in the south: [[Emmendingen (district)|Emmendingen]], [[Schwarzwald-Baar]], [[Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald]], [[Lörrach (district)|Lörrach]] and [[Waldshut (district)|Waldshut]].

==Ecology and economy==
The forest mostly consists of [[pine]]s and [[fir]]s, some of which are grown in commercial [[monoculture]]. Similar to other forested regions, the Black Forest has had areas that were decimated by mass [[logging]]. Due to logging and land use changes the forest proper is only a fraction of its original size. The storm [[Lothar (storm)|Lothar]] downed trees on hundreds of acres of mountaintops in 1999. This left some of the high peaks and scenic hills bare, with only primary growth shrubs and young fir trees.

The main industry is [[tourism]]. In addition to the towns and monuments noted below, the Black Forest is crossed by numerous [[long distance footpath]]s, including some of the first to be established. The [[European long-distance path]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] crosses the Black Forest following the routes of some of the local long-distance paths. There are numerous shorter paths suitable for day walks, as well as [[mountain biking]] and [[cross-country skiing]] trails. The total network of tracks amounts to around {{convert|23000|km}}, and is maintained and overseen by a voluntary body, the ''[[Schwarzwaldverein]]'' (Black Forest Society), which has around 90,000 members (figures from Bremke, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

==Points of interest==
[[Image:Windbuchencom.jpg|thumb|Winter on [[Schauinsland]]: famous &quot;Windbuchen&quot; [[Beech]]es bent by the wind]]
There are many old towns in the Black Forest. Popular tourist destinations include [[Freiburg]], [[Calw]] (the birth town of [[Hermann Hesse]]), [[Gengenbach]], [[Staufen, Germany|Staufen]], [[Schiltach]], [[Haslach]] and [[Altensteig]]. Other popular destinations include such mountains as the Feldberg, the [[Belchen]], the [[Kandel (Black Forest)|Kandel]], and the Schauinsland; the [[Titisee]] and [[Schluchsee]] lakes; the [[All Saints Waterfalls]]; the [[Triberg Waterfalls]], not the highest, but the most famous waterfalls in Germany; and the [[canyon|gorge]] of the River [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]].

The [[Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof]] is an open-air museum that shows the life of sixteenth or seventeenth century farmers in the region, featuring a number of reconstructed Black Forest farms. The [[Deutsches Uhrenmuseum|German Clock Museum]] in [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen]] shows the history of the [[clock]] industry and of [[watch]]makers.

For drivers, the main route through the region is the rapid A5 (E35) motorway, but a variety of sign-posted scenic routes such as the Schwarzwald-Hochstrasse ({{convert|60|km|abbr=on}}, [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Freudenstadt]]), Schwarzwald Tälerstrasse ({{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}, the [[Murg]] and [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]] valleys) or Badische Weinstrasse (Baden Wine Street, {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}, a wine route from [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Weil am Rhein]]) offers calmer driving along high roads. &lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article97082.ece] &lt;/ref&gt; The last is a picturesque trip starting in the south of the Black Forest going north and includes numerous old wineries and tiny villages. Another, more specialized route is the 'Deutsche Uhrenstraße' (&quot;German Clock Road&quot;),  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-uhrenstrasse.de/sofindensieunsen.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; a circular route which traces the [[horology|horological]] history of the region.

Due to the rich mining history dating from medieval times (the Black Forest was one of the most important mining regions of Europe circa 1100) there are many mines re-opened to the public. Such mines may be visited in the Kinzig valley, the Suggental, the Muenster valley, and around Todtmoos.

The Black Forest was visited on several occasions by Count [[Otto von Bismarck]] during his rule 1873-1890. Allegedly, he especially was interested in the [[Triberg Waterfalls]].  &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GOwOyUl7-TMC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=bismarck+triberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o0tRfEUt2Z&amp;sig=EddXNLXfR1TCIzsN2HxkV2MnM_4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result] &lt;/ref&gt; There is now a monument in Triberg dedicated to Bismarck, who apparently enjoyed the tranquility of the region, which was lacking at his residence in Berlin.

==Fauna==
In addition to the expected kinds of wildlife to be found in a European forest area, the following types of animals may be observed in the Black Forest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackforest-tourism.com/index.php/layout/set/print/sprachversionen/natur/natur_mit_allen_sinnen_wahrnehmen__1 Enjoy nature with all the senses / Nature / Home / Inhalte - Schwarzwald Tourismus GmbH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these animals include

*Cattle: The Black Forest cattle belong to the rare breed of &quot;Hinterwälderberg&quot; cattle
*The giant earthworm ''[[Lumbricus badensis]]'' is found only in the Black Forest region&lt;ref&gt;Lamparski, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Black Forest Foxes'' are a breed of [[horse]], previously indispensable for heavy field work
*[[Eagle]]s and [[owl]]s can be seen at close range

==Culture==
[[File:Du200613.gif|thumb|120px|right|A cuckoo clock, symbol of the Black Forest and Germany.]]
Dialects spoken in the Black Forest area are [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] and [[Swabian German|Swabian]].

===Fasnet===
The German holiday of [[Fastnacht]], or Fasnet, as it is known in the Black Forest region, occurs in the time leading up to [[Lent]]. On [[Rosenmontag]], or the Monday before Ash Wednesday, crowds of people line the streets, wearing masks. One prominent style of mask is called the Black Forest Style, originating from the Black Forest Region.

===Crafts===
[[Wood-carving]] is a traditional cottage industry in the region and carved ornaments now are produced in substantial numbers as souvenirs for tourists. [[Cuckoo clock]]s are a popular example; they have been made in the region since the early eighteenth century and much of their development occurred there.

===Culinary===
[[Black Forest ham]] originated from this region, and so, by name and reputation at least, did the [[Black Forest Cake]]. It also is known as the &quot;Black Forest Cherry Cake&quot; or &quot;Black Forest Gateau&quot; and is made with chocolate cake, cream, sour cherries and [[Kirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeancuisines.com/German-Schwarzwalder-Kirschtorte-Recipe-Black-Forest-Cake-Cherry-Kirsch&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Forest variety of ''[[Tarte flambée|Flammkuchen]]'' is a Badisch specialty made with ham, cheese and cream. ''[[Pancake|Pfannkuchen]]'', a [[crêpe]] or [[Pancake#Regional varieties|crêpe-like]] ([[:de:Eierkuchen|''Eierkuchen'']] or ''[[Palatschinken]]'') pastry, is also common.

The '''Black Sea''' is an [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] bounded by [[Europe]], [[Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus]] and is ultimately connected to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Aegean Sea]]s and various [[strait]]s. The [[Bosphorus]] strait connects it to the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the strait of the [[Dardanelles]] connects that sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. These waters separate [[eastern Europe]] and [[western Asia]]. The Black Sea also connects to the [[Sea of Azov]] by the [[Strait of Kerch]].

The Black Sea has an area of {{convert|436400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} (not including the Sea of Azov),&lt;ref&gt;Surface Area—{{cite web |title=Black Sea Geography |work=University of Delaware College of Marine Studies |url=http://www.ocean.udel.edu/blacksea/geography/index.html |year=2003 | accessdate = 2006-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a maximum depth of {{convert|2206|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Maximum Depth—{{cite web |title=Europa - Gateway of the European Union Website |work=Environment and Enlargement - The Black Sea: Facts and Figures |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enlarg/blackseafactsfigures_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a volume of {{Convert|547000|km3|cumi|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unexpected changes in the oxic/anoxic interface in the Black Sea |work=Nature Publishing Group |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v338/n6214/abs/338411a0.html |date=1989-03-30 | accessdate = 2006-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Sea forms in an east-west trending elliptical depression which lies between [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNEP2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Socio-economic indicators for the countries of the Black Sea basin|year=2001|author=UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library |authorlink=United Nations Environment Programme|url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/sosio_economic_indicators_for_the_countries_of_the_black_sea_basin_giwa| accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is constrained by the [[Pontic Mountains]] to the south, the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to the east and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about 1,175&amp;nbsp;km.

Important cities along the coast include [[Batumi]], [[Burgas]], [[Constanţa]], [[Giresun]], [[Hopa]], [[Istanbul]], [[Kerch]], [[Kherson]], [[Mangalia]], [[Năvodari]], [[Novorossiysk]], [[Odessa]], [[Ordu]], [[Poti]], [[Rize]], [[Samsun]], [[Sevastopol]], [[Sochi]], [[Sukhumi]], [[Trabzon]], [[Varna]], [[Yalta]] and [[Zonguldak]].

The Black Sea has a positive [[water balance]]; that is, a net outflow of water 300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea. Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea as part of a two-way hydrological exchange. The Black Sea outflow is cooler and less [[saline water|saline]], and therefore floats over the warm, more saline Mediterranean inflow, leading to a significant [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] layer well below the surface waters. The Black Sea also receives river water from large [[Eurasia]]n [[fluvial]] systems to the north of the Sea, of which the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Dnieper]] and [[Danube]] are the most significant.

In the past, the water level has varied significantly. Due to these variations in the water level in the basin the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been land. At certain critical water levels it is possible for connections with surrounding water bodies to become established. It is through the most active of these connective routes, the [[Turkish Straits]], that the Black Sea joins the [[world ocean]]. When this hydrological link is not present, the Black Sea is a [[lake]], operating independently of the global ocean system. Currently the Black Sea water level is relatively high, thus water is being exchanged with the [[Mediterranean]]. The Turkish Straits connect the Black and Aegean Seas and comprise the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles.

==Extent==

The Black Sea got its name from the Ottoman Turks. 'Kara (Black)' denotes 'North' in Medieval Turkish, as in Kara Denizi- [[Kara Sea]] north of Siberian Yakut Turks, similar to Black Sea. In Turkish 'Red' denotes south as in Kizil Deniz, [[Red Sea]] to the south of Anatolia, while 'Ak'-White denotes west. The old name for the Aegean and the Mediterranean combined in Anatolian Turkish is &quot;Akdeniz&quot; -the White Sea-; although in contemporary Turkish, Akdeniz denotes only the Mediterranean Sea as now the northern part of the Mediterranean is called the Aegean Sea following its Western name. During the Ottoman times this was not the case as the Aegean was called  the Sea of Islands - [[Adalar Denizi]] referring to the 12 islands lying between Greece and Anatolia.

The Black Sea is one of four seas named in English after common [[color term]]s — the others being the [[Red Sea]], the [[White Sea]] and the [[Yellow Sea]].

===Historical names===
[[Strabo]]'s Geography (1.2.10) reports that in antiquity, the Black Sea was often just called &quot;the Sea&quot; (''ho pontos''). For the most part, Graeco-Roman tradition refers to the Black Sea as the 'Hospitable sea', ''Euxeinos Pontos'' ({{Polytonic|Εὔξεινος Πόντος}}). This is a [[euphemism]] replacing an earlier 'Inhospitable Sea', ''Pontos Axeinos'', first attested in [[Pindar]] (early fifth century BCE,~475 BC). Strabo (7.3.6) thinks that the Black Sea was called &quot;inhospitable&quot; before Greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate, and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes. The name was changed to &quot;hospitable&quot; after the [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]] had colonized southern shoreline, the [[Pontus]], making it part of Greek civilization.

It is also possible that the name ''Axeinos'' arose by [[Folk etymology|popular etymology]] from a [[Scythian]] [[Iranian languages|Iranic]] ''axšaina-'' 'unlit,' 'dark'; the designation &quot;Black Sea&quot; may thus date from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

A map of Asia dating to 1570, entitled Asiae Nova Descriptio, from Ortelis's Theatrum labels the sea &quot;Mar Maggior.&quot;

[[Image:Sudak vlasenko.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Sudak]]]]

The geological origins of the basin can be traced back to two distinct relict [[back arc basin]]s which were initiated by the splitting of an [[Albian]] [[volcanic arc]] and the [[subduction]] of both the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleo]]-and Neo-[[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] Oceans, but the timings of these events remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, D.

(2000). &quot;Global Positioning System constraints on plate kinematics and dynamics in the eastern Mediterranean and Caucasus.&quot; Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth 105(B3): 5695–5719.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its initiation, compressional tectonic environments led to [[subsidence]] in the basin, interspersed with extensional phases resulting in large-scale [[volcanism]] and numerous [[orogeny|orogenies]], causing the uplift of the [[Greater Caucasus]], [[Pontides]], Southern [[Crimea]] and [[Balkan]]ides mountain ranges. The ongoing collision between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[African Plate|African]] plates and westward escape of the [[Anatolian Plate|Anatolian]] block along the [[North Anatolian Fault]] and [[East Anatolian Fault]]s dictates the current tectonic regime,&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, D.

The modern basin is divided into 2 sub-basins by a convexity extending south from the Crimean Peninsula. The large shelf to the north of the basin is up to 190&amp;nbsp;km wide, and features a shallow apron with gradients between 1:40 and 1:1000. The southern edge around Turkey and the western edge around [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], however, are typified by a narrow shelf that rarely exceeds 20&amp;nbsp;km in width and a steep apron that is typically 1:40 gradient with numerous submarine canyons and channel extensions. The [[Euxine abyssal plain]] in the centre of the Black Sea reaches a maximum depth of {{convert|2212|m|2|abbr=on}} just south of Yalta on the Crimean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Remote Sensing of the European Seas&quot; (2008) ISBN 1402067712, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9B3D5-HBTzkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22euxine+abyssal+plain%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=c7Tox4mIZV&amp;sig=Lxaell7YMVs2AsJcpgWowr_Vl04&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[littoral zone]] of the Black Sea is often referred to as the '''Pontic littoral'''.

==Hydrology and hydrochemistry==
[[Image:The Danube Spills into the Black Sea.jpg|thumb|This [[SeaWiFS]] view reveals the colourful interplay of currents on the sea’s surface.]]

The Black Sea is the world’s largest [[meromictic]] basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of [[water]] that receive [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is [[anoxic sea water|anoxic water]]. The current hydrochemical configuration is primarily controlled by basin topography and [[fluvial]] inputs, which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure and a positive water balance. The upper layers are generally cooler, less dense and less salty than the deeper waters, as they are fed by large fluvial systems, whereas the deep waters originate from the warm, salty waters of the Mediterranean. This influx of dense water from Mediterranean is balanced by an outflow of fresher Black Sea surface-water into the Marmara Sea, maintaining the stratification and [[salinity]] levels.

The surface water has an average salinity of 18 to 18.5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per notation|parts per thousand]] (compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans) and contains oxygen and other nutrients required to sustain biotic activity. These waters circulate in a basin-wide [[cyclonic]] [[shelf break|shelfbreak]] [[gyre]] known as the Rim Current which transports water round the perimeter of the Black Sea. Within this feature, two smaller cyclonic gyres operate, occupying the eastern and western sectors of the basin. Outside the Rim Current, numerous quasi-permanent coastal eddies are formed as a result of [[upwelling]] around the coastal apron and ‘wind curl’ mechanisms. The intra-annual strength of these features is controlled by seasonal atmospheric and fluvial variations. The temperature of the surface waters varies seasonally from {{convert|8|°C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|14|°C}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Directly beneath the surface waters the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL) is found. This layer is composed of cool, salty surface waters, which are the result of localised atmospheric cooling and decreased fluvial input during the winter months. The production of this water is focused in the centre of the major gyres and on the NW shelf and as the water is not dense enough to penetrate the deep waters, [[isopycnal]] [[advection]] occurs, dispersing the water across the entire basin. The base of the CIL is marked by a major [[thermocline]], [[halocline]] and [[pycnocline]] at {{nowrap|~100–200 m}} and this density disparity is the major mechanism for isolation of the deep water.

[[File:Black Sea Nasa May 25 2004.jpg|thumb|left|May 2004. Phytoplankton blooms and plumes of sediment form the bright blue swirls that ring the Black Sea in this Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image]]

Below the pycnocline, salinity increases to 22 to 22.5&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per notation|ppt]] and temperatures rise to around {{convert|8.5|°C}}. The hydrochemical environment shifts from oxygenated to anoxic, as bacterial decomposition of sunken biomass utilises all of the free oxygen. Certain species of [[extremophile]] bacteria are capable of using [[sulfate]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[redox|oxidation]] of [[organic material]], which leads to the creation of [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). This enables the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of [[sulfide]]s such as the [[iron sulphide]]s [[pyrite]], [[greigite]] and iron monosulphide, as well as the dissolution of carbonate matter such as [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), found in shells. Organic matter, including [[anthropogenic]] artifacts such as boat hulls, are well preserved. During periods of high surface productivity, short-lived [[algae|algal]] blooms form organic rich layers known as [[sapropel]]s. Scientists have reported an annual [[phytoplankton]] bloom that can be seen in many NASA images of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=3669 Black Sea Becomes Turquoise] earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved 2 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these characteristics the Black Sea has gained interest from the field of [[marine archaeology]] as ancient shipwrecks in excellent states of preservation have been discovered, such as the [[Byzantine]] wreck [[Sinop D]], located in the anoxic layer off the coast of [[Sinop, Turkey]].

Modelling shows the release of the [[hydrogen sulphide]] clouds in the event of an [[asteroid impact]] into the Black Sea would pose a threat to health—or even life—for people living on the Black Sea coast.&lt;ref&gt;R.D.

== Ecology ==

[[File:POTI.JPG|right|thumb|Port of [[Poti]], Georgia]]
The Black Sea supports an active and dynamic marine ecosystem, dominated by species suited to the [[brackish]], nutrient-rich, conditions. As with all marine food webs, the Black Sea features a range of [[Trophic level|trophic]] groups, with [[autotrophic]] algae, including [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]], acting as primary producers. The fluvial systems draining Eurasia and central Europe introduce large volumes of sediment and dissolved nutrients into the Black Sea, but distribution of these nutrients is controlled by the degree of physiochemical stratification, which is, in turn, dictated by seasonal physiographic development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;&gt;Oguz, T., H. W. Ducklow, et al. (1999). &quot;A physical-biochemical model of plankton productivity and nitrogen cycling in the Black Sea.&quot; Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 46(4): 597-636.&lt;/ref&gt;  During winter, strong wind promotes convective overturning and upwelling of nutrients, while high summer temperatures result in a marked vertical stratification and a warm, shallow mixed layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz&quot;&gt;Oguz, T. and A. Merico (2006). &quot;Factors controlling the summer Emiliania huxleyi bloom in the Black Sea: A modeling study.&quot; Journal of Marine Systems 59(3-4): 173-188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Day length and [[insolation]] intensity also controls the extent of the [[photic zone]]. Subsurface productivity is limited by nutrient availability, as the anoxic bottom waters act as a sink for reduced nitrate, in the form of ammonia. The [[benthic]] zone also plays an important role in Black Sea nutrient cycling, as chemosynthetic organisms and anoxic geochemical pathways recycle nutrients which can be upwelled to the photic zone, enhancing productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, J., C. Dinkel, et al. (2002). &quot;Benthic Nutrient Cycling and Diagenetic Pathways in the North-western Black Sea.&quot; Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 54(3): 369-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phytoplankton===

The main phytoplankton groups present in the Black Sea are [[dinoflagellates]], [[diatoms]], [[coccolithophores]] and [[cyanobacteria]] (see list below). Generally, the annual cycle of phytoplankton development comprises significant diatom and dinoflagellate-dominated spring production, followed by a weaker mixed assemblage of community development below the seasonal thermocline during summer months and a surface-intensified autumn production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eker, E., L. Georgieva, et al. (1999). &quot;Phytoplankton distribution in the western and eastern Black Sea in spring and autumn 1995.&quot; Ices Journal of Marine Science 56: 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This pattern of productivity is also augmented by an ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'' bloom during the late spring and summer months.

*'''[[Dinoflagellates]]''': Annual dinoflagellate distribution is defined by an extended bloom period in subsurface waters during the late spring and summer. In November, subsurface plankton production is combined with surface production, due to vertical mixing of water masses and nutrients such as nitrite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;/&gt;  The major bloom-forming dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea is ''[[Gymnodinium]]'' sp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eker-Develi, E 2003&quot;&gt;Eker-Develi, E. and A. E. Kideys (2003). &quot;Distribution of phytoplankton in the southern Black Sea in summer 1996, spring and autumn 1998.&quot; Journal of Marine Systems 39(3-4): 203-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of dinoflagellate diversity in the Black Sea range from 193 species &lt;ref&gt;Krakhmalny, A. F. (1994). &quot;Dinophyta of the Black Sea (Brief history of investigations and species diversity).&quot; Algologiya 4: 99-107.&lt;/ref&gt; to 267 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot;&gt;Gomez, F. and L. Boicenco (2004). &quot;An annotated checklist of dinoflagellates in the Black Sea.&quot; [[Hydrobiologia]] 517(1): 43-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  This level of species richness is relatively low in comparison to the Mediterranean Sea, which is attributable to the brackish conditions, low water transparency and presence of [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] bottom waters. It is also possible that the low winter temperature &lt;4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C of the Black Sea prevent [[thermophilous]] species from becoming established. The relatively high organic matter content of Black Sea surface water favour the development of [[heterotrophic]] (an organism which uses organic carbon for growth) and mixotrophic dinoflagellates species (able to exploit different trophic pathways), relative to autotrophs. Despite its unique hydrographic setting, there are no confirmed [[endemism|endemic]] dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot;/&gt;

* '''[[Diatoms]]''': The Black Sea is populated by many species of marine diatom, which commonly exist as colonies of [[unicellular]], non-motile auto- and [[heterotrophic]] [[algae]]. The life-cycle of most diatoms can be described as `boom and bust' and the Black Sea is no exception, with diatom blooms occurring in surface waters throughout the year, most reliably during March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;/&gt;  In simple terms, the phase of rapid population growth in diatoms is caused by the in-wash of [[Si]]-bearing terrestrial sediments, and when the supply of Si is exhausted, the diatoms begin to sink out of the photic zone and produce resting [[cysts]]. Additional factors such as predation by zooplankton and [[ammonium]]-based regenerated production also have a role to play in the annual diatom cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz&quot;/&gt;  Typically, ''Proboscia alata'' blooms during spring and ''Pseudosolenia calcar-avis'' blooms during the autumn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eker-Develi, E 2003&quot;/&gt;

* '''[[Coccolithophores]]''': Coccolithophores are a type of [[motile]], [[autotrophic]] [[phytoplankton]] that produce CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plates, known as [[coccoliths]], as part of their life cycle. In the Black Sea, the main period of [[coccolithophore]] growth occurs after the bulk of the dinoflagellate growth has taken place. In May, the dinoflagellates move below the seasonal [[thermocline]], into deeper waters, where more nutrients are available. This permits coccolithophores to utilise the nutrients in the upper waters, and by the end of May, with favourable light and temperature conditions, growth rates reach their highest. The major bloom forming species is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', which is also responsible for the release of [[dimethyl sulfide]] into the atmosphere. Overall, coccolithophore diversity is low in the Black Sea, and although recent sediments are dominated by ''E. huxleyi'', ''Braarudosphaera bigelowii'', [[Holocene]] sediments have also been shown to contain Helicopondosphaera and Discolithina species.

*'''[[Cyanobacteria]]''': Cyanobacteria are a phylum of [[picoplankton]]ic (plankton ranging in size from 0.2 - 2 micrometre) [[bacteria]] that obtain their energy via [[photosynthesis]], and are present throughout the world's oceans. They exhibit a range of morphologiies, including filamentous colonies and [[biofilms]]. In the Black Sea, several species are present, and as an example, ''Synechococcus'' spp. can be found throughout the photic zone, although concentration decreases with increasing depth. Other factors which exert an influence on distribution include nutrient availability, predation and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Uysal, Z. (2006). &quot;Vertical distribution of marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus spp. in the Black, Marmara, Aegean, and eastern Mediterranean seas.&quot; Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography 53(17-19): 1976-1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Zebra mussel]]''': The Black Sea along with the [[Caspian Sea]] is part of the Zebra mussel's native range. The mussel has been accidentally introduced around the world and become an [[invasive species]] where it has been introduced.

*'''[[Common Carp]]''': The Common Carp's native range extends to The Black Sea along with the Caspian Sea and [[Aral Sea]]. Like the Zebra mussel the Common Carp is an invasive species when introduced to other habitats.

*'''[[Round Goby]]''': Is another native fish that is also found in the Caspian Sea. It preys upon Zebra mussels. Like the mussels and common carp it has become invasive when introduced to other environments, like the [[Great Lakes]].
 
===The effect of pollution on Black Sea ecology===

Since the 1960s, rapid industrial expansion along the Black Sea coast line and the construction of a major dam has significantly increased annual variability in the N:P:Si ratio in the basin. In coastal areas, the biological effect of these changes has been an increase in the frequency of monospecific phytoplankton blooms, with diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 2.5 and non-diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 6. The non-diatoms, such as the prymnesiophytes ''Emiliania huxleyi'' (coccolithophore), ''Chromulina'' sp., and the Euglenophyte ''Eutreptia lanowii'' are able to out-compete diatom species because of the limited availability of Si, a necessary constituent of diatom frustules.&lt;ref&gt;Humborg, C., V. Ittekkot, et al. (1997). &quot;Effect of Danube River dam on Black Sea biogeochemistry and ecosystem structure.&quot; Nature 386(6623): 385-388.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of these blooms, benthic macrophyte populations were deprived of light, while anoxia caused mass mortality in marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;Sburlea, A., L. Boicenco, et al. (2006). &quot;Aspects of eutrophication as a chemical pollution with implications on marine biota at the Romanian Black Sea shore.&quot; Chemicals as Intentional and Accidental Global Environmental Threats: 357-360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregoire, M., C. Raick, et al. (2008). &quot;Numerical modeling of the central Black Sea ecosystem functioning during the eutrophication phase.&quot; Progress in Oceanography 76(3): 286-333.&lt;/ref&gt;  The decline in macrophytes was further compounded by overfishing during the 1970s, while the invasive ctenophore ''Mnemiopsis'' reduced the biomass of copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s. Additionally, an alien species—the [[warty comb jelly]] (''Mnemiopsis leidyi'')—was able to establish itself in the basin, exploding from a few individuals to an estimated biomass of one billion metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colinwoodard.com Woodard, Colin], ''[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465015719 Ocean's End: Travels Through Endangered Seas]'', New York: Basic Books, 2000, pp. 1–28&lt;/ref&gt; The change in species composition in Black Sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry, as Ca-producing coccolithophores influence salinity and pH, although these ramifications have yet to be fully quantified. In central Black Sea waters, Si levels were also significantly reduced, due to a decrease in the flux of Si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localised alterations in Black Sea nutrient input to have basin-wide impacts.

Pollution reduction and regulation efforts have led to a partial recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem during the 1990s, and an EU monitoring exercise, 'EROS21', revealed decreased N and P values, relative to the 1989 peak.&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot, C., J. Staneva, et al. (2002). &quot;Modelling the [[Danube]]-influenced north-western continental shelf of the Black Sea. II: Ecosystem response to changes in nutrient delivery by the Danube River after its damming in 1972.&quot; Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science 54(3): 473-499.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, scientists have noted signs of ecological recovery, in part due to the construction of new sewage treatment plants in Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria in connection with membership in the European Union. ''Mnemiopsis leidyi'' populations have been checked with the arrival of another alien species which feeds on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colinwoodard.com Woodard, Colin], [http://www.cqpress.com/docs/AffiliationsPDFs/oceans.pdf &quot;The Black Sea's Cautionary Tale,&quot;] ''Congressional Quarterly Global Researcher'', October 2007, pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Short-term climatic variation in the Black Sea region is significantly influenced by the operation of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]], which is a term used to describe the climatic mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the north Atlantic and mid-latitude air masses.&lt;ref&gt;Hurrell, J. W. (1995). &quot;Decadal trends in the North-Atlantic oscillation – Regional temperatures and precipitation&quot; Science 269(5224): 676–679.&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact mechanisms causing the North Atlantic Oscillation remain unclear,&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, F., Arz, H.

==Mediterranean connection during the Holocene==
[[File:Istambul and Bosporus big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Bosphorus, taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[File:Dardanelles map2.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Dardanelles]]

The Black Sea is connected to the [[World Ocean]] by a chain of two shallow straits, the [[Dardanelles]] and the Bosphorus. The Dardannelles is {{convert|55|m|2|abbr=on}} deep and the Bosphorus is as shallow as {{convert|36|m|2|abbr=on}}. By comparison, at the height of the last [[Ice age]], sea levels were more than {{convert|100|m|2|abbr=on}} lower than they are now. There's also evidence that water levels in the Black Sea, too, were considerably lower at some point during the post-glacial period. Thus, for example, archeologists found fresh-water snail shells and man-made structures in roughly {{convert|328|ft|m}} of water off the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. Therefore it is agreed that the Black Sea has been a landlocked freshwater lake (at least in upper layers) during the last glaciation and for some time after.

In the aftermath of the Ice Age, water levels in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water. The exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate. One possibility is that the Black Sea filled first, with excess fresh water flowing over the Bosphorus sill and eventually into the Mediterranean Sea. There are also catastrophic scenarios, such as the &quot;[[Black Sea deluge theory]]&quot; put forward by [[William Ryan (geologist)|William Ryan]] and [[Walter Pitman (geologist)|Walter Pitman]].

==Deluge hypothesis==
{{Main|Black Sea deluge theory}}
In 1997, William Ryan and Walter Pitman from [[Columbia University]] published a hypothesis according to which a massive flood through the Bosphorus occurred in ancient times. They claim that the Black and [[Caspian Sea]]s were vast freshwater lakes, but then about 5600 BC, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] spilled over a rocky sill at the Bosphorus, creating the current communication between the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Subsequent work has been done both to support and to discredit this hypothesis, and archaeologists still debate it. This has led some to associate this catastrophe with prehistoric [[Deluge (mythology)|flood myths]].&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', William Ryan and Walter Pitman, ''Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries About the Event That Changed History''. Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, New York, NY, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg|thumb|Medieval map of the Black Sea]]
[[File:Aivaz theodosia.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. ''Black Sea Fleet in the Bay of Theodosia'', just before the [[Crimean War]]]]

The Black Sea was a busy waterway on the crossroads of the ancient world: the Balkans to the West, the Eurasian [[steppes]] to the north, Caucasus and Central Asia to the East, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to the south, and Greece to the south-west. The oldest processed gold in the world, arguably left by Old Europeans, was found in Varna, and the Black Sea was supposedly sailed by the [[Argonauts]]. The land at the eastern end of the Black Sea, [[Colchis]], (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), marked for the Greeks an edge of the known world. The steppes to the north of the Black Sea have been suggested as the original homeland (''[[Urheimat]]'') of the speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], (PIE) the progenitor of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, by some scholars (see [[Kurgan]]; others move the heartland further east towards the [[Caspian Sea]], yet others to [[Anatolia]]). Numerous ancient ports line Black Sea's coasts, some older than the pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chadparmet.home.comcast.net/~chadparmet/BlackSea/overview/blacksea.html |title=The Black Sea |publisher=Chadparmet.home.comcast.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Sea was a significant naval theatre of [[Naval warfare of World War I#Black Sea|World War I]] and saw both naval and land battles during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]].

==Archaeology==
Ancient trade routes in the region are currently being extensively studied by scientists, as the Black Sea was sailed by [[Hittites]], [[Carians]], [[Thracians]], [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Slavs]], [[Varangians]], [[Crusaders]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanians]], [[Colchis|Georgians]], [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poles]], [[Tatars]], [[Ottomans]], and [[Russians]]. Perhaps the most promising areas in deepwater archaeology are the quest for submerged prehistoric settlements in the continental shelf and for ancient shipwrecks in the anoxic zone, which are expected to be exceptionally well preserved due to the absence of oxygen. This concentration of historical powers, combined with the preservative qualities of the deep [[anoxic waters]] of the Black Sea, has attracted increased interest from [[marine archaeology|marine archaeologists]] who have begun to discover a large number of [[Ancient Black Sea shipwrecks|ancient ships and organic remains]] in a high state of preservation.

==Holiday resorts and spas==

In the years following the end of the [[Cold War]], the popularity of the Black Sea as a [[tourism|tourist]] destination has been steadily increasing. Overall, tourism at Black Sea resorts has become one of the region's growth industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bulgariansearesorts.com |title=Bulgarian Sea Resorts |accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of well-known {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Black Sea [[resort]]s:

The '''Bible''' (from [[Koine Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία}} ''ta biblia'' &quot;the books&quot;), known as the '''Holy Bible''', refers to several similar collections of the primary [[religious text]]s of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. The Bible is the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling book]] in history with more than 6 billion copies published.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblesociety.org.uk/about-the-bible/what-is-the-bible/what-is-the-bible-2/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref name=RussellAsh&gt;{{Cite book| author= Ash, Russell | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Top 10 of Everything 2002 | year=2001 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location= | isbn=0789480433, 9780789480439 }} See also [http://www.google.com/search?q=It+has+been+bought+and+read+more+than+any+other+book+%28Businessweek+7%2F18%2F2005+reports+2.5+billion+copies+sold.+Author+Russell&amp;btnG=Search&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq= Google Link]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2011}}

There is no single Bible, as the individual books ([[Biblical canon]]), their contents and their order vary between denominations. Mainstream Judaism divides the [[Tanakh]] into 24 books, while a minority stream of Judaism, the [[Samaritans]], accepts only five. The 24 texts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] are divided into 39 books in Christian [[Old Testament]]s, and complete [[Christian Bible]]s range from the 66 books of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] canon to the 81 books in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethiopian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/canonical/books.html |title=The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church |publisher=Ethiopianorthodox.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Bible, or ''[[Tanakh]]'', is divided into three parts: (1) the five books of the ''[[Torah]]'' (&quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;law&quot;) comprise the origins of the Israelite nation, its laws and its covenant with the [[God of Israel]]; (2) the ''[[Nevi'im]]'' (&quot;prophets&quot;) containing the historic account of [[ancient Israel and Judah]] plus works of prophecy; and (3) the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (&quot;writings&quot;), poetic and philosophical works such as the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, B. ''the First Historians: The Hebrew Bible.'' Harper &amp; Row, 1988, quoted in Smith, Mark S.''The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.; 2nd ed., 2002. ISBN 978-0802839725, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian Bible]] is divided into two parts. The first is called the [[Old Testament]], containing the (minimum) 39 books of Hebrew Scripture, and the second portion is called the [[New Testament]], containing a set of 27 books. The first four books of the New Testament form the [[Canonical gospels]] which recount the life of Christ and are central to the [[Christian faith]].

Christian Bibles include the books of the Hebrew Bible, but arranged in a different order: Jewish Scripture ends with the people of Israel restored to Jerusalem and the temple and the Christian arrangement ends with the book of the prophet [[Malachi]].

The oldest surviving Christian Bibles are Greek manuscripts from the 4th century; the oldest complete Jewish Bible is a [[Septuagint|Greek translation]], also dating to the 4th century. The oldest complete manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible (the [[Masoretic text]]) date from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=M1rS4Kce_PMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Memories%20of%20Ancient%20Israel&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Philip R.

During the three centuries following the [[origin of Christianity|establishment of Christianity]] in the 1st century, [[Church Fathers]] compiled [[Gospel]] accounts and letters of apostles into a Christian Bible which became known as the [[New Testament]].
The Old and New Testaments together are commonly referred to as &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; ({{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια}}). The canonical composition of the Old Testament is under dispute between Christian groups: [[Protestant]]s hold only the books of the Hebrew Bible to be canonical; Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox additionally consider the [[deuterocanonical books]], a group of Jewish books, to be canonical. The New Testament is composed of the Gospels (&quot;[[good news (Christianity)|good news]]&quot;), the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|Epistles]] (letters), and the [[Book of Revelation]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Family-bible.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An American family Bible dating to 1859.]]
The English word ''[[:wikt:bible|bible]]'' is from the Latin ''biblia'', traced from the same word through [[Medieval Latin]] and [[Late Latin]] and ultimately from [[Koine Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία}} ''ta biblia'' &quot;the books&quot; (singular {{lang|grc|βιβλίον}} ''biblion'').&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline-bible&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Middle Latin]] ''biblia'' is short for ''biblia sacra'' &quot;holy book&quot;, while ''biblia'' in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. ''bibliorum''). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (''biblia,'' gen. ''bibliae'') in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02543a.htm |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''biblia sacra'' &quot;holy books&quot; translates Greek {{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια}} ''ta biblia ta hagia'', &quot;the holy books&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319917 Biblion, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A'' Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word {{lang|grc|βιβλίον}} itself had the literal meaning of &quot;paper&quot; or &quot;scroll&quot; and came to be used as the ordinary word for &quot;[[book]]&quot;.
It is the diminutive of {{lang|grc|βύβλος}} ''bublos'', &quot;Egyptian papyrus&quot;, possibly so called from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n port [[Byblos]] (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian [[papyrus]] was exported to Greece.
The Greek ''ta biblia'' (lit. &quot;little papyrus books&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg&quot;&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Nashville: Broadman, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7.&lt;/ref&gt; was &quot;an expression [[Hellenistic Jews]] used to describe their sacred books (the [[Septuagint]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/scriptures.html &quot;From Hebrew Bible to Christian Bible&quot; by Mark Hamilton] on PBS's site [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/ From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Bible Dictionary.com etymology of the word &quot;Bible&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;
Christian use of the term can be traced to ca. AD 223.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline-bible&quot; /&gt;

==Jewish canon==
===Development of the Jewish canon===
{{Main|Development of the Jewish Bible canon}}
[[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|תנ&quot;ך}}) refers to the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures, [[Torah]] (&quot;Teaching&quot;), [[Nevi'im]] (&quot;Prophets&quot;) and [[Ketuvim]] (&quot;Writings&quot;). The Hebrew Bible probably was canonized in three stages: 1) the law - canonized before the Exile, 2) the prophets - by the time of the Syrian persecution of the Jews, 3) and the writings - shortly after AD 70 (the fall of Jerusalem). About that time, early Christian writings began to be accepted by Christians as &quot;scripture&quot;. These events, taken together, may have caused the Jews to close their &quot;canon&quot;. They listed their own recognized Scriptures, and excluded both Christian and Jewish writings considered by them to be &quot;apocryphal&quot;. In this canon the thirty-nine books found in the Old Testament of today's Christian Bibles were grouped together as twenty-two books, equaling the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. This canon of Jewish scripture is attested to by Philo, Josephus, the New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|11:51}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Talmud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg&quot; /&gt;

The Bible used at [[Qumran]] excluded [[Book of Esther|Esther]] but included [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]. Otherwise, it seems to have been basically the same as the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, albeit with many textual variants.

===Torah===
{{Main|Torah}}
The Torah, or &quot;Instruction,&quot; is also known as the &quot;Five Books&quot; of [[Moses]], thus [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] from Hebrew meaning &quot;fivesome,&quot; and [[Pentateuch]] from Greek meaning &quot;five scroll-cases.&quot; The Hebrew book titles come from some of the first words in the respective texts.

The Torah comprises the following five books:
# [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], &lt;small&gt;Ge&lt;/small&gt;—Bereshith (בראשית)
# [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], &lt;small&gt;Ex&lt;/small&gt;—Shemot (שמות)
# [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], &lt;small&gt;Le&lt;/small&gt;—Vayikra (ויקרא)
# [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], &lt;small&gt;Nu&lt;/small&gt;—Bamidbar (במדבר)
# [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], &lt;small&gt;Dt&lt;/small&gt;—Devarim (דברים)

The Torah focuses on three moments in the changing relationship between God and people. The first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Hebrew [[patriarch]]s, [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] (also called [[Israel]]), and Jacob's children (the &quot;[[Children of Israel]]&quot;), especially [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of [[Ur]], eventually to settle in the land of [[Canaan]], and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of [[Moses]], who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. His story coincides with the story of the liberation of the Children of Israel from slavery in [[Ancient Egypt]], to the renewal of their covenant with God at [[Mount Sinai]], and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation would be ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.

The Torah contains the commandments, of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate amongst Jewish scholars as to whether this was written down completely in one moment, or if it was spread out during the 40 years in the wandering in the desert). These commandments provide the basis for [[Halakha]] (Jewish religious law). Tradition states that the number of these is equal to [[613 Mitzvot]] or 613 commandments. There is some dispute as to how to divide these up (mainly between the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] and [[Rambam]]).

The Torah is divided into fifty-four portions which are read on successive [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]s in Jewish liturgy, from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Deuteronomy. The cycle ends and recommences at the end of [[Sukkot]], which is called [[Simchat Torah]].

===Nevi'im===
{{Main|Nevi'im}}
The [[Nevi'im]], or &quot;Prophets,&quot; tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy, its division into two kingdoms, and the prophets who, in God's name, warned the kings and the Children of Israel about the punishment of God. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians and the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians, and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Portions of the prophetic books are read by Jews on the Sabbath ([[Shabbat]]). The [[Book of Jonah]] is read on [[Yom Kippur]].

According to Jewish tradition, Nevi'im is divided into eight books. Contemporary translations subdivide these into twenty-one books.

The Nevi'im comprise the following eight books:

#&lt;li value=&quot;6&quot;&gt; [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], &lt;small&gt;Js&lt;/small&gt;—Yehoshua (יהושע)
# [[Book of Judges|Judges]], &lt;small&gt;Jg&lt;/small&gt;—Shoftim (שופטים)
# [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], includes First and Second &lt;small&gt;1Sa–2Sa&lt;/small&gt;—Sh'muel (שמואל)
# [[Books of Kings|Kings]], includes First and Second, &lt;small&gt;1Ki–2Ki&lt;/small&gt;—Melakhim (מלכים)
# [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], &lt;small&gt;Is&lt;/small&gt;—Yeshayahu (ישעיהו)
# [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], &lt;small&gt;Je&lt;/small&gt;—Yirmiyahu (ירמיהו)
# [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], &lt;small&gt;Ez&lt;/small&gt;—Yekhezkel (יחזקאל)
# Twelve, includes all [[minor prophet|Minor Prophets]]—Tre Asar (תרי עשר)
#* A. [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]], &lt;small&gt;Ho&lt;/small&gt;—Hoshea (הושע)
#* B. [[Book of Joel|Joel]], &lt;small&gt;Jl&lt;/small&gt;—Yoel (יואל)
#* C. [[Book of Amos|Amos]], &lt;small&gt;Am&lt;/small&gt;—Amos (עמוס)
#* D. [[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]], &lt;small&gt;Ob&lt;/small&gt;—Ovadyah (עבדיה)
#* E. [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]], &lt;small&gt;Jh&lt;/small&gt;—Yonah (יונה)
#* F. [[Book of Micah|Micah]], &lt;small&gt;Mi&lt;/small&gt;—Mikhah (מיכה)
#* G. [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], &lt;small&gt;Na&lt;/small&gt;—Nahum (נחום)
#* H. [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]], &lt;small&gt;Hb&lt;/small&gt;—Havakuk (חבקוק)
#* I. [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]], &lt;small&gt;Zp&lt;/small&gt;—Tsefanya (צפניה)
#* J. [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], &lt;small&gt;Hg&lt;/small&gt;—Khagay (חגי)
#* K. [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], &lt;small&gt;Zc&lt;/small&gt;—Zekharyah (זכריה)
#* L. [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], &lt;small&gt;Ml&lt;/small&gt;—Malakhi (מלאכי)

===Ketuvim===
{{Main|Ketuvim}}
The [[Ketuvim]], or &quot;Writings&quot; or &quot;Scriptures,&quot; may have been written during or after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]]. Many of the psalms in the book of [[Psalms]] are attributed to [[David (biblical king)|David]]; [[King Solomon]] is believed to have written [[Song of Songs]] in his youth, [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] at the prime of his life, and [[Ecclesiastes]] at old age; and the prophet [[Jeremiah]] is thought to have written [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]]. The [[Book of Ruth]] is the only biblical book that centers entirely on a non-Jew. The book of Ruth tells the story of a non-Jew (specifically, a [[Moab]]itess) who married a Jew and, upon her husband's death, [[Proselyte|followed in the ways of the Jews]]; according to the Bible, she was the great-grandmother of [[King David]]. Five of the books, called &quot;The Five Scrolls&quot; (Megilot), are read on Jewish holidays: Song of Songs on [[Passover]]; the [[Book of Ruth]] on [[Shavuot]]; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] on the [[Ninth of Av]]; Ecclesiastes on [[Sukkot]]; and the [[Book of Esther]] on [[Purim]]. Collectively, the Ketuvim contain lyrical poetry, philosophical reflections on life, and the stories of the prophets and other Jewish leaders during the Babylonian exile. It ends with the Persian decree allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple.

The Ketuvim comprise the following eleven books, divided, in many modern translations, into twelve through the division of Ezra and Nehemiah:

#&lt;li value=&quot;14&quot;&gt; [[Psalms]], &lt;small&gt;Ps&lt;/small&gt;—Tehillim (תהלים)
# [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], &lt;small&gt;Pr&lt;/small&gt;—Mishlei (משלי)
# [[Book of Job|Job]], &lt;small&gt;Jb&lt;/small&gt;—Iyyov (איוב)
# [[Song of Songs]], &lt;small&gt;So&lt;/small&gt;—Shir ha-Shirim (שיר השירים)
# [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], &lt;small&gt;Ru&lt;/small&gt;—Rut (רות)
# [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], &lt;small&gt;La&lt;/small&gt;—Eikhah (איכה), also called Kinot (קינות)
# [[Book of Ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes]], &lt;small&gt;Ec&lt;/small&gt;—Kohelet (קהלת)
# [[Book of Esther|Esther]], &lt;small&gt;Es&lt;/small&gt;—Ester (אסתר)
# [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], &lt;small&gt;Dn&lt;/small&gt;—Daniel (דניאל)
# [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], &lt;small&gt;Ea&lt;/small&gt;, includes [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]], &lt;small&gt;Ne&lt;/small&gt;—Ezra (עזרא), includes Nehemiah (נחמיה)
# [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], includes First and Second, &lt;small&gt;1Ch–2Ch&lt;/small&gt;—Divrei ha-Yamim (דברי הימים), also called Divrei (דברי)

===Hebrew Bible translations and editions===
{{Main|Bible translations}}
The Tanakh was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csbbc.net/bible.html |title=Bible Study, Bible Facts |accessdate=2007-11-05 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Oral Torah===
According to some Jews during the [[Hellenistic period]], such as the [[Sadducees]], only a minimal oral tradition of interpreting the words of the Torah existed, which did not include extended biblical interpretation. According to the [[Pharisee]]s, however, God revealed both a Written Torah and an [[Oral Torah]] to Moses, the Oral Torah consisting of both stories and legal traditions. In Rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah is essential for understanding the Written Torah literally (as it includes neither vowels nor punctuation) and [[exegesis|exegetically]]. The Oral Torah has different facets, principally [[Halacha]] (laws), the [[Aggadah]] (stories), and the [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric knowledge). Major portions of the Oral Law have been committed to writing, notably the [[Mishnah]]; the [[Tosefta]]; [[Midrash]], such as [[Midrash Rabbah]], the [[Sifre]], the [[Sifra]], and the [[Mechilta]]; and both the Babylonian and Jerusalem [[Talmud]]s as well. It may have even influenced [[Oral tradition and the historical Jesus|early Jewish Christianity]].

[[Orthodox Judaism]] continues to accept the Oral Torah in its totality. [[Masorti]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] state that the Oral Tradition is to some degree divinely inspired, but disregard its legal elements in varying degrees. [[Reform Judaism]] also gives some credence to the Talmud containing the legal elements of the Oral Torah, but, as with the written Torah, asserts that both were inspired by, but not dictated by, God. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] denies any connection of the Torah, Written or Oral, with God.

The article ''[[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]]'' discusses the Jewish understanding of the Bible, including Bible commentaries from the ancient [[Targums]] to classical [[Rabbinic literature]], the [[midrash]] literature, the classical [[Meforshim|medieval commentators]], and modern day Jewish Bible commentaries.

===Septuagint===
{{main|Septuagint}}
The Septuagint was an edition of the Hebrew Bible translated into Greek. The Septuagint included books and additions not found in the Hebrew Bible. Modern Jewish Bibles follow the [[Masoretic Text]] rather than the Septuagint. The Septuagint splits certain books in two, so that the book of Kings, for example, became First Kings and Second Kings. Christian Bibles maintain these divisions. The Septuagint was also the source for the books found in the Christian Old Testament but not in the Hebrew Bible.

==Christian canons==
{{Main|Christian biblical canons}}
The Christian Bible consists of the Hebrew scriptures of Judaism, which are known as the Old Testament; and later writings recording the lives and teachings of [[Jesus]] and his followers, known as the New Testament. &quot;Testament&quot; is a translation of the Greek διαθηκη (''diatheke''), also often translated &quot;covenant.&quot; It is a legal term denoting a formal and legally binding declaration of benefits to be given by one party to another (e.g., &quot;last will and testament&quot; in secular use). Here it does not connote mutuality; rather, it is a unilateral covenant offered by God to individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg&quot; /&gt;

Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of one or both of these &quot;Testaments&quot; of their sacred writings—most prominent among which are the [[biblical apocrypha]] or [[deuterocanonical books]].

Significant versions of the English Christian Bible include the [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]], the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]], the [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]], and the [[New International Version|NIV]]. For a complete list, see [[List of English Bible translations]].

In Judaism, the term ''Christian Bible'' is commonly used to identify only those books like the New Testament which have been added by Christians to the [[Masoretic Text]], and excludes any reference to an ''Old Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/shavuottorah/shavuottorahdefault/Accuracy_of_Torah_Text.asp Accuracy of Torah Text].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Testament===
{{Main|Old Testament}}
The Old Testament consists of a collection of writings believed to have been composed at various times from the twelfth to the 2nd century BC. The books were written in classical Hebrew, except for brief portions ({{Bibleref2|Ezra|4:8–6:18}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Ezra|7:12–26}}, {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|10:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Daniel|2:4–7:28}}) which are in the [[Aramaic language]], a sister language which became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Semitic world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Driver&quot;&gt;Sir Godfrey Driver. &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible.&quot; Web: 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the material, including many genealogies, poems and narratives, is thought to have been handed down by word of mouth for many generations. Very few manuscripts are said to have survived the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.&lt;ref name=&quot;Driver&quot; /&gt;

The Old Testament is accepted by Christians as [[scripture]]. Broadly speaking, it contains the same material as the [[Hebrew Bible]]. However, the order of the books is not entirely the same as that found in Hebrew manuscripts and in the ancient versions and varies from Judaism in interpretation and emphasis (see for example [[Isaiah 7:14]]). Christian denominations disagree about the incorporation of a small number of books into their [[Biblical canon|canons]] of the Old Testament. A few groups consider particular translations to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]], notably the Greek [[Septuagint]], the Aramaic [[Peshitta]], and the English [[King James Version]].

====Apocryphal or deuterocanonical books====
The [[Septuagint]] (Greek translation, from Alexandria in Egypt under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]]) was generally abandoned in favour of the [[Masoretic]] text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into [[Western world|Western]] languages from St. Jerome's Bible (the [[Vulgate]]) to the present day. In [[Eastern Christianity]], translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. Some modern Western translations make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts e.g. those discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

A number of books which are part of the Peshitta or Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible are often referred to as [[deuterocanonical books]] by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e. deutero) canon. Most Protestants term these books as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]]. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] and those of the Modern [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles [[Biblical apocrypha|included them]] in Apocrypha sections until around the 1820s. However, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes:
* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]
* [[Book of Judith|Judith]]
* [[1 Maccabees]]
* [[2 Maccabees]]
* [[Wisdom of Solomon]]
* [[Sirach]] also called [[Ecclesiasticus]]
* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]
* [[The Letter of Jeremiah]] ([[Baruch]] Chapter 6)
* [[Additions to Esther|Greek Additions to Esther]]
* [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]
* [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]]
* [[Bel and the Dragon]]

In addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following:

* [[3 Maccabees]]
* [[1 Esdras]]
* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]
* [[Psalm 151]]

Some other Eastern Orthodox Churches include:

* [[2 Esdras]] i.e., Latin Esdras in the Russian and Georgian Bibles

There is also [[4 Maccabees]] which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church, but was included by [[St. Jerome]] in an appendix to the [[Vulgate]], and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.

The [[Anglican Church]]es uses some of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal books]] liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus [[1 Esdras]], [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], which were in the Vulgate appendix.

====Role in Christian theology====
{{see|Sola scriptura|Christian theology}}
The Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar [[N.T. Wright]] says Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures. He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the ancient Israelites' scriptures as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the &quot;new covenant&quot; prophesied by Jeremiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;&gt;Wright, N.T. ''The Last Word: Scripture and the Authority of God—Getting Beyond the Bible Wars.'' HarperCollins, 2005. ISBN 0060872616 / 9780060872618&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
{{Main|Canonical gospels|New Testament}}
The New Testament is a collection of 27 books, of 4 different [[genres]] of Christian literature ([[Gospels]], one account of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Epistles]] and an [[Apocalyptic literature|Apocalypse]]). [[Jesus]] is its central figure. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old (2 Timothy 3:16). Nearly all Christians recognize the New Testament (as stated below) as canonical [[Sacred text|scripture]]. These books can be grouped into:

{{Col-begin}}

{{Col-break}}

'''[[Gospel|The Gospels]]'''

* '''[[Synoptic Gospels]]'''
** [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospel According to Matthew]], &lt;small&gt;Mt&lt;/small&gt;

'''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]''', or the Apocalypse &lt;small&gt;Re&lt;/small&gt;

{{Col-end}}

The order of these books varies according to Church tradition. The New Testament books are ordered differently in the Catholic/Protestant tradition, the Slavonic tradition, the Syriac tradition and the Ethiopian tradition.

====Original language====
{{see also|Oral tradition and the historical Jesus}}
The books of the New Testament were written in [[Koine Greek]], the language of the earliest extant manuscripts, even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See [[Greek primacy]]. Some scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the Gospel of Matthew) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. Of these, a small number accept the Syriac Peshitta as representative of the original. See [[Aramaic primacy]]. In 2008, [[N.T. Wright|Dr. N.T. Wright]], the Bishop of Durham, stated that Dr. Christopher Evans of King's College London, used to argue that the study of the Greek New Testament, not least the synoptic gospels, presented undergraduates &quot;with a more demanding set of interlocking intellectual
challenges than any other subject in the university&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright1&quot;&gt;Evans, Christopher. King's College London. Quoted in Wright, N.T. &quot;New Testament Scholarship and Christian Discipleship.&quot; 5 June 2008. Web: 27 February 2010 [http://www.ridley.cam.ac.uk/documents/moulemem.pdf N.T. Wright on NT Scholarship and Christian Discipleship]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historic editions====
[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumb|The '''[[Codex Gigas]]''' from the 13th century, held at the [[Swedish Royal Library|Royal Library]] in [[Sweden]].]]
{{See also|Biblical manuscript|Bible translations|Textual criticism}}
When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal glosses'') to correct their text—especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line—and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions.

The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the versions that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (generally minimalist), the [[Byzantine text-type]] (generally maximalist), and the [[Western text-type]] (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.

===Development===
{{Main|Development of the Old Testament canon|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of [[synod]]s produced a list of texts equal to the 39-to-46-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in AD 393. Also ''c''. 400, [[Jerome]] produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see [[Vulgate]]), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time. A definitive list did not come from an [[Ecumenical Council]] until the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Canon of the New Testament]: &quot;The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the Tridentine Council.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], certain reformers proposed different canonical lists to those currently in use. Though not without debate, see [[Antilegomena]], the list of New Testament books would come to remain the same; however, the Old Testament texts present in the Septuagint, but not included in the Jewish canon, fell out of favor. In time they would come to be removed from most Protestant canons. Hence, in a Catholic context these texts are referred to as deuterocanonical books, whereas in a Protestant context they are referred to as Apocrypha, the label applied to all texts excluded from the biblical canon which were in the Septuagint. It should also be noted, that Catholics and Protestants both describe certain other books, such as the [[Acts of Peter]], as [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]].

Thus, the Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon—the number varies from that of the books in the Tanakh (though not in content) because of a different method of division—while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books as part of the canonical Old Testament. The Orthodox Churches, in addition to the Catholic canon, recognise 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognises a longer canon. The term &quot;Hebrew Scriptures&quot; is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.

The New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in {{Bibleref2|2Tim|3:16||2 Timothy 3:16}}, &quot;all Scripture is inspired of God.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg&quot; /&gt;

===Ethiopian Orthodox canon===
The Canon of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] is wider than for most other Christian groups. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the [[Septuagint]] accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] and [[Jubilees]] which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez but are quoted in the New Testament (citation required), also Greek Ezra [[1 Esdras|First]] and the [[Jewish Apocalypse of Ezra|Apocalypse of Ezra]], 3 books of [[Meqabyan]], and [[Psalm 151]] at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.

===Marcionite Bible===
[[Marcion]], an early Christian [[Christian heresy|heretic]], and his followers, had a Bible that excluded the Old Testament. It consisted of an edited [[Gospel of Luke]] (excluding what Marcion considered Jewish additions), and the [[Epistles of Paul]] (excluding [[Titus]], the two epistles to Timothy, the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], and passages rejected as Jewish additions).&lt;ref&gt;Paula Fredriksen, ''Augustine and the Jews'', ISBN 978-0-385-50270-2 (2008), pp. 67-68, 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief in divine inspiration===
{{main|Biblical literalism|Biblical infallibility|Biblical inerrancy}}
Some Christians adhere to a doctrine of biblical literalism, i.e. they regard both the New and Old Testament as the [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant Word of God]], spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans.
Others hold the perspective of [[Biblical infallibility]]: that the Bible is free from error in spiritual but not scientific matters. &quot;Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;

Belief in sacred texts is attested to in Jewish antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''De vita Moysis'' 3.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephus&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Contra Apion'' 1.8.&lt;/ref&gt; and this belief can also be seen in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention Divine agency in relation to prophetic writings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Original Source&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam%2023:2,2%20Tim%203:16,Luke%201:70,Heb%203:7,10:15-16,1%20Peter%201:11,Mark%2012:36,2%20Peter%201:20-21,Acts%201:16,Acts%203:18,Acts%2028:25;&amp;version=50 |title=Basis for belief of Inspiration Biblegateway |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most explicit being: &quot;All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.&quot;{{bibleref2c|2Tim|3:16|ESV|2 Timothy 3:16}}

In their book ''A General Introduction to the Bible'', [[Norman Geisler]] and William Nix wrote: &quot;The process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norman L. Geisler, William E. Nix.

ISBN 0-310-39281-0&lt;/ref&gt; associate inspiration with only the original text; for example some American Protestants adhere to the 1978 [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] which asserted that inspiration applied only to the [[autograph]]ic text of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;

A minority even within adherents of biblical literalism extend the claim of inerrancy to a particular translation, e.g. the  [[King-James-Only Movement]].

==Bible versions and translations==
{{See|Bible translations|Bible translations by language}}
[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|A Bible handwritten in [[Latin]], on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire, England]]. This Bible was transcribed in [[Belgium]] in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery.]]
Bible versions are discussed below, while [[Bible translations]] can be found on a separate page.

The original texts of the Tanakh were in Hebrew, although some portions were in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the [[Targum Onkelos]], an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as [[Aleppo Codex]]. Even in this version by itself, there are words which are traditionally read differently from written (sometimes one word is written and another is read), because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.

The primary biblical text for early Christians was the [[Septuagint|Septuagint or (LXX)]]. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.

The earliest Latin translation was the Old Latin text, or [[Vetus Latina]], which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.

[[Pope Damasus I]] assembled the first list of books of the Bible at the [[Council of Rome]] in AD 382. He commissioned Saint [[Jerome]] to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the [[Vulgate|Latin Vulgate Bible]] and in 1546 at the [[Council of Trent]] was declared by the Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the [[Latin Rite]].

Especially since the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Bible translations]] for many languages have been made. The Bible has seen a notably large number of [[English translations of the Bible|English language translations]].

==Biblical criticism==
{{Main|Biblical criticism|Criticism of the Bible}}
[[Biblical criticism]] refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as [[criticism of the Bible]], which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance.

===Higher criticism===
{{Main|Higher criticism|Lower criticism}}
In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was &quot;clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses....&quot; Despite determined opposition from Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, the views of Hobbes and Spinoza gained increasing acceptance amongst scholars.

===Documentary hypothesis===
{{Main|Documentary hypothesis}}
{{Split section|Torah|date=September 2010}}
The medieval tradition of [[Mosaic authorship]] of the Pentateuch ([[Torah]]) came under [[philology|philological]] scrutiny with the development of [[Biblical criticism]] in the 18th century.
H. B. Witter {{Year needed|date=September 2010}}, [[Jean Astruc]] (1753), and [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn]] (1803) separated the Pentateuch into two original documentary components, both dating from after the time of Moses.
Others hypothesized the presence of two additional sources. The four documents were given working titles: J ([[Jahwist]]/Yahwist), E ([[Elohist]]), P ([[Priestly source|Priestly]]), and D ([[Deuteronomist]]). Each was discernible by its own characteristic language, and each, when read in isolation, presented a unified, coherent narrative.

Subsequent [[Higher criticism|scholars]], notably Eduard Reuss, [[Karl Heinrich Graf]] and Wilhelm Vatke, turned their attention to the order in which the documents had been composed (which they deduced from internal clues) and placed them in the context of a theory of the development of ancient Israelite religion, suggesting that much of the Laws and the narrative of the Pentateuch were unknown to the Israelites in the time of Moses.

These were synthesized by [[Julius Wellhausen]] (1844–1918), who suggested a historical framework for the composition of the documents and their redaction (combination) into the final document known as the Pentateuch. This hypothesis was challenged by [[William Henry Green]] in his ''The Mosaic Origins of the Pentateuchal Codes'' ([http://www.biblicaltheology.org/mop.html available online]). Nonetheless, according to contemporary Torah scholar [[Richard Elliott Friedman]], Wellhausen's model of the [[documentary hypothesis]] continues to dominate the field of biblical scholarship: &quot;To this day, if you want to disagree, you disagree with Wellhausen. If you want to pose a new model, you compare its merits with those of Wellhausen's model.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Elliott Friedman, &quot;Who Wrote the Bible?,&quot; HarperSanFrancisco, 1997 (2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary hypothesis is important in the field of biblical studies not only because it claims that the Torah was written by different people at different times—generally long after the events it describes—&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rosenberg, 1984 &quot;The Bible: Biblical Narrative&quot; in Barry Holtz, ed ''Back to the Sources'' New York: Summit Books p. 36; Nahum Sarna, 1986 ''Understanding Genesis'' New York:Schocken Books pp. xxi-xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; but it also proposed what was at the time a radically new way of reading the Bible. Many proponents {{Who|October 2010|date=October 2010}} of the documentary hypothesis view the Bible more as a body of literature than a work of history, believing that the historical value of the text lies not in its account of the events that it describes, but in what critics can infer about the times in which the authors lived (as critics may read ''[[Hamlet]]'' to learn about 17th-century England, but will not read it to learn about 7th-century Denmark).

Wellhausen's hypothesis proposed that the four documents were composed in the order J-E-D-P, with P, containing the bulk of the Jewish law, dating from the post-Exilic [[Second Temple]] period (i.e., after 515 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Wellhausen adopted the idea of a post-Exilic date for P from [[Edouard Guillaume Eugène Reuss|Eduard Reuss]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary hypothesis has been modified by numerous later authors.
The contemporary view{{By whom|date=September 2010}} is that P is earlier than D, and that all four books date from the [[First Temple]] period (i.e., prior to 587 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Although the ''bulk'' of all four documents date from before 587 BC, the strand of D known as Dtr2 dates from the following Exilic period.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Noth]] (who in 1943 provided evidence that Deuteronomy plus the following six books make a unified history from the hand of a single editor), [[Harold Bloom]], [[Frank Moore Cross]] and [[Richard Elliot Friedman]] also presented versions of the hypothesis.

The documentary hypothesis, at least in the four-document version advanced by Wellhausen, has been controversial since its formulation, and not all biblical scholars accept J, E, D, and P as meaningful terms.
Critics question the existence of separate, identifiable documents, positing instead that the biblical text is made up of almost innumerable strands so interwoven as to be hardly untangleable. The J document, in particular, has been subjected to such intense dissection that it seems in danger of disappearing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The hypothesis dominated biblical scholarship for much of the 20th century, and, although increasingly challenged by other models in the last part of the 20th century, its terminology and insights continue to provide the framework for modern theories on the origins of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Wenham|Wenham, Gordon]]. [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html &quot;Pentateuchal Studies Today&quot;, Themelios 22.1 (October 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological and historical research==
{{Main|Biblical archaeology school|The Bible and history}}
Biblical archaeology is the [[archaeology]] that relates to, and sheds light upon, the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times.

There are a wide range of interpretations of the existing Biblical archaeology. One broad division includes [[Biblical maximalism]] that generally take the view that most of the Old Testament or [[Hebrew Bible]] is essentially based on history although presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered the opposite of [[Biblical Minimalism|biblical minimalism]] which considers the Bible a purely [[post-exilic]]  (5th century BCE and later) composition. In any case, even accepting Biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era]]s, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the 6th century onward have a basis in history.

On the other hand, the historicity of the biblical account of the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah]] of the 10th to 7th centuries BC is disputed in scholarship.
The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the [[United Monarchy]] (10th century BC) and the [[historicity of David]] is far from clear. For this reason,  archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the [[Tel Dan Stele]], can potentially be decisive.

Finally, the biblical account of events of the [[Exodus from Egypt]] in the [[Torah]], and the migration to the [[Promised Land]] and the period of [[Biblical judges|Judges]] are not considered historical in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Regarding the [[New Testament]], the setting being the [[Roman Empire]] period in the 1st century, the historical context is well established. There has nevertheless been some debate on the [[historicity of Jesus]], but the mainstream opinion is clearly that Jesus was one of several known historical itinerant preachers in 1st-century [[Roman Judea]], teaching in the context of the religious upheavals and sectarianism of [[Second Temple Judaism]].

'''British Columbia''' {{IPAc-en|En-ca-BritishColumbia.ogg|ˌ|b|r|ɪ|t|ɪ|ʃ|_|k|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|b|ɪ|ə}} ('''B.C.''') ({{lang-fr|la Colombie-Britannique}}, ''C.-B.'') is the western most of [[Canada]]'s [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and is known for its natural beauty, as reflected in its [[Latin]] motto, ''Splendor sine occasu'' (&quot;Splendour without Diminishment&quot;). Its name was chosen by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1858. In 1871, it became the sixth province of [[Canada]].

The capital of British Columbia is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|fifteenth largest metropolitan region]] in Canada. The largest city is [[Vancouver]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Canada, the largest in [[Western Canada]], and the second-largest in the [[Pacific Northwest]].  In 2009, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,419,974 (about two and a half million of whom were in [[Greater Vancouver]]).  The province is currently governed by the [[BC Liberal Party]], led by [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Christy Clark]], who became leader as a result of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party leadership elections|party election on February 26, 2011]].

British Columbia's economy is largely resource-based. It is the endpoint of transcontinental highways and railways and the site of major Pacific ports, which enable international trade. Because of its mild weather, and despite the fact that less than 5% of its land is arable, the province is agriculturally rich, particularly in the [[Fraser Valley|Fraser]] and [[Okanagan]] Valleys. Its climate encourages [[outdoor recreation]] and [[tourism]], though its economic mainstay has long been [[resource extraction]], principally logging and mining.

==Etymology==
The province's name was chosen by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] when the [[Colony of British Columbia]], i.e. &quot;the Mainland&quot;, became a British colony in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Ged Martin, &quot;The Naming of British Columbia,&quot; ''Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies,'' Vol. 10, No. 3 (Autumn, 1978), pp. 257–263 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4048132 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[Columbia District]], the British name for the territory drained by the [[Columbia River]], which has its origins and upper reaches in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-[[Oregon Treaty]] Columbia Department of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Queen Victoria chose ''British'' Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from that of the [[United States]] (&quot;American Columbia&quot; or &quot;Southern Columbia&quot;), which became the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1848 as a result of the treaty.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of British Columbia}}
[[File:BC-relief.png|thumb|300px|right|British Columbia's geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief, which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization.]]

British Columbia is bordered by the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the west, by the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] on the northwest, on the north by the [[Yukon]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], on the east by the province of [[Alberta]], and on the south by the U.S. states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. The current [[Definitions of Canadian borders#British Columbia|southern border of British Columbia]] was established by the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]], although its history is tied with lands as far south as [[California]]. British Columbia's land area is {{convert|944735|km2|-2}}. [[British Columbia Coast|British Columbia's rugged coastline]] stretches for more than {{convert|27000|km}}, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about six thousand islands, most of which are uninhabited.

British Columbia's capital is Victoria, located at the southeastern tip of [[Vancouver Island]]. The province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is not on Vancouver Island but rather is located in the southwest corner of the mainland (an area often called the [[Lower Mainland]]). Other major cities include [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[Burnaby]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], and [[New Westminster]] in the Lower Mainland; [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], [[Pitt Meadows]], [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] and [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]] in the [[Fraser Valley]]; [[Nanaimo]] on [[Vancouver Island]]; and [[Kelowna]] and [[Kamloops]] in the [[Interior Plateau|Interior]]. [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] is the largest city in the northern part of the province, while a village northwest of it, [[Vanderhoof, British Columbia|Vanderhoof]], is near the geographic centre of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Vanderhoof
 | publisher = Tourism BC
 | url = http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm
 | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coast Mountains]] and the [[Inside Passage]]'s many [[fjord|inlets]] provide some of British Columbia's renowned and spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and [[ecotourism]] industry. Seventy-five percent of the province is mountainous (more than {{convert|1000|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]); 60% is forested; and only about 5% is arable. 

The [[Okanagan area (wine)|Okanagan area]] is one of various wine-growing regions in Canada and also produces [[cider]]s; other wine regions in British Columbia include the [[Cowichan Valley]] on Vancouver Island, and the [[Fraser Valley]]. The cities of Kamloops and [[Penticton]], and rural towns of [[Oliver, British Columbia|Oliver]], and [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada, although their temperature ranges are exceeded by the warmer [[Fraser Canyon]] towns of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] and [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]], where shade temperatures on summer afternoons often surpass {{convert|40|C}} but with very low humidity.

Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by [[temperate rainforest]]. The province's mainland away from the coastal regions is not as moderated by the Pacific Ocean and ranges from desert and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] plateau to the range and canyon districts of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior]] to boreal forest and sub-arctic prairie in the [[British Columbia Interior|Northern Interior]]. 

A few [[Southern Interior]] valleys have short cold winters with infrequent heavy snow, while those in the [[Cariboo]], the southern part of the [[British Columbia Interior#Central Interior|Central Interior]], are colder because of their altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada. The northern two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, and is mostly mountainous except east of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockies]], where the [[Peace River Country|Peace River District]], in the northeast of the province contains BC's portion of the [[Canadian Prairies]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Strait of Georgia]], near [[Vancouver]].]]
As a result of [[Japan Current|Kuroshio Current]] (also known as the Japan Current), which crosses the North Pacific Ocean, coastal British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate. Due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the Interior of the province has a semi-arid climate with certain locations receiving less than 250mm (10&quot;) in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province are above {{convert|10|C|0}}, the mildest anywhere in Canada. 

Winters can be severe in the Interior and the North. For example, the average overnight low in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (roughly located in the middle of the province) in January is {{convert|-14|C|0}}. The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in [[Smith River, British Columbia|Smith River]], where it dropped to {{convert|-58.9|C|0}},{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North America. Southern Interior valleys have shorter winters with brief bouts of cold. Heavy snowfall occurs in the Coast, Columbia and Rocky Mountains providing healthy bases for skiers. 

On the Coast, rainfall, sometimes relentless heavy rain, dominates in winter because of consistent barrages of cyclonic low-pressure systems from the North Pacific, but on occasion (and not every winter) heavy snowfalls and below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas for typically short periods. On the opposite extreme, summers in the Southern Interior valleys are hot, for example in [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] the July Maximum averages {{convert|32|C|0}}, hot weather sometimes moves towards the Coast or to the far North. Temperatures have gone over {{convert|40|C|0}} in the past, with the record high being held in [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]], when the temperature rose to {{convert|44.4|C}} on July 16, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=CA&amp;StationID=966&amp;Year=1941&amp;Month=7&amp;Day=26 |title=Daily Data Report for July 1941 |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=2010-09-21 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires, from dry-lightning or man-made causes. Coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer, under the influence of stable anti-cyclonic high pressure much of the time. Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during winter, despite sunny summers. Annual sunshine hours vary from 2300 near Cranbrook to less than 1300 sun hours per year in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], located on the [[British Columbia Coast#North Coast|North Coast]], just south of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].

===Parks and protected areas===
{{Main|List of protected areas of British Columbia|List of British Columbia Provincial Parks}}
[[Image:Mount Robson2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mount Robson]], [[Canadian Rockies]], B.C.]]

There are 14 designations of parks and protected areas in the province that reflects the different administration and creation of these areas in a modern context. There are 141 ecological Reserves, 35 provincial marine parks, 7 Provincial Heritage Sites, 6 [[National Historic Sites of Canada]], 4 [[National park|National Parks]] and 3 National Park Reserves. 12.5% ({{convert|114000|km2|abbr=on}}) of British Columbia is currently considered protected under one of the 14 different designations that includes over 800 distinct areas.

British Columbia contains seven of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's national parks]]:
*[[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]]
*[[Gulf Islands National Park Reserve]]
*[[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site]]
*[[Kootenay National Park]]
*[[Mount Revelstoke National Park]]
*[[Pacific Rim National Park Reserve]]
*[[Yoho National Park]]

British Columbia also contains a large network of [[provincial park]]s, run by BC Parks of the Ministry of Environment. British Columbia's provincial parks system is the second largest parks system in Canada (the largest is Canada's National Parks system).

Another tier of parks in British Columbia are [[regional park]]s, which are maintained and run by [[regional districts]].

In addition to these areas, over {{convert|47000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[arable land]] are protected by the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]].

===Fauna===
[[Image:TakakkawFalls2 edit.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Yoho National Park]].]]
Much of the province is wild or semi-wild, so that populations of many mammalian species that have become rare in much of the United States still flourish in British Columbia. Watching animals of various sorts, including a very wide range of [[bird]]s, has also long been popular. Bears ([[Grizzly Bear|grizzly]], [[American Black Bear|black]], and the [[Kermode bear]] or spirit bear—only found in British Columbia) live here, as do [[deer]], [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[Bighorn Sheep|big-horn sheep]], [[mountain goat]]s, [[marmot]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[muskrat]], [[coyote]]s, [[Gray Wolf|wolves]], [[mustelidae|mustelids]] (such as [[wolverine]]s, [[badger]]s and [[fisher (animal)|fishers]]), [[Cougar]], [[eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s, [[Canada Goose|Canada geese]], [[swan]]s, [[loon]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[raven]]s, [[Harlequin Duck]]s, and many other sorts of ducks. Smaller birds ([[American Robin|robins]], [[jay]]s, [[grosbeak]]s, [[Tit (bird)|chickadees]], and so on.) also abound.

Healthy populations of many sorts of fish are found in the waters (including [[salmonidae|salmonids]] such as several species of [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[Salvelinus|char]], and so on.). Besides salmon and trout, sport-fishers in B.C. also catch [[halibut]], [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[sturgeon]]. On the coastlines, [[Harbor Seal]]s and [[North American River Otter|river otter]]s are common. [[Cetacea]]n species native to the coast include the [[Killer Whale|Orca]], [[Gray Whale]], [[Harbour Porpoise]], [[Dall's Porpoise]], [[Pacific White-sided Dolphin]] and [[Minke Whale]].

[[Image:Cheakamuslake.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Cheakamus Lake]] at dawn, in [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]], B.C.]]
British Columbian introduced species include: common [[Taraxacum|dandelion]], [[Common Pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]], [[Pacific oyster]], [[brown trout]], [[black slug]], [[European Starling]], [[cowbird]], [[Centaurea|knapweed]], [[bullfrog]], [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]], [[Cytisus scoparius|Scotch broom]], [[Forficula auricularia|European earwig]], [[tent caterpillar]], [[Woodlouse|sowbug]], gray [[squirrel]], Asian [[longhorn beetle]], [[Hedera helix|English ivy]], [[Fallow Deer]], [[thistle]], [[gorse]], Norway [[rat]], crested [[myna]]h, and Asian or European [[gypsy moth]].

Some endangered species in British Columbia are: [[Vancouver Island marmot]], [[Spotted Owl]], [[American White Pelican]], and badgers.

==History==
{{Main|History of British Columbia}}

===Fur trade and colonial era===
The discovery of stone tools on the [[Beatton River]] near [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] date human habitation in British Columbia to at least 11,500 years ago. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] spread throughout the region, achieving a high [[population density]]; at the time of European contact, nearly half the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal people in present-day Canada]] lived in the region. During the 1770s, [[smallpox]] killed at least 30% of the Pacific Northwest [[First Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lange |first=Greg |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5100 |title=Smallpox epidemic ravages Native Americans on the northwest coast of North America in the 1770s. |publisher=Historylink.org |date=2003-01-23 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This epidemic was the first and the most devastating of a number that were to follow, other than the Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1862 which killed off 50% of the native population in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.php?id=4547 |title=Plagues and Peoples on the Northwest Coast |publisher=.h-net.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Kwakiutl house pole InvMH975-123-1 .jpg|thumb|upright|150px|[[Kwakwaka'wakw]] [[Totem pole|house pole]], second half of the 19th century]]
The explorations of [[James Cook]] in 1778 and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792-93 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of [[Dean Channel]] near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and these other explorers—notably [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], [[Samuel Black]], &lt;!--also John Campbell and others but they're less well-known, though in some ways no less important; Black in particular--&gt;and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]—were primarily concerned with extending the [[fur trade]], rather than political considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.

The establishment of [[trading post]]s under the auspices of the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District, broadly defined as being south of 54°40 north latitude, (the southern limit of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]]) and north of Mexican Controlled California west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was, by the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], under the &quot;joint occupancy and use&quot; of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the Oregon Treaty of 1846.

The major supply route was the [[York Factory Express]] between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Fort Vancouver]]. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St. John (established 1794); [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]] (1805); [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] (1805); [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]] (1806); Prince George (1807); Kamloops (1812); [[Fort Langley, British Columbia|Fort Langley]] (1827); [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843); [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include [[Vancouver, Washington]] ([[Fort Vancouver]]), formerly the &quot;capital&quot; of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, [[Colville, Washington]] and [[Walla Walla, Washington]] (old [[Fort Nez Percés]]).

With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, the region now comprising British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the [[Thompson River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca District]], headquartered in [[Fort Chipewyan, Alberta|Fort Chipewyan]], in present day Alberta.

Until 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of [[British North America]] under the [[de facto]] jurisdiction of HBC administrators. Unlike [[Rupert's Land]] to the north and east, however, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern [[Columbia Basin|Columbia basin]] (within present day Washington and [[Oregon]]). In 1846, the Oregon Treaty divided the territory along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia Strait]], with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, &quot;administered&quot; by individual HBC trading post managers.

With the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial office]] to formally designate the mainland as the [[Colony of British Columbia]], with New Westminster as its capital. A series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] and Lillooet, which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in 1866.

===Rapid growth and development===
[[Image:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]] drives the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], 7 November 1885. Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]

The Confederation League, including such figures as [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[John Robson]], and [[Robert Beaven]], led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). Several factors motivated this agitation, including the fear of annexation to the United States, the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush. 

With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on 20 July 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled until 1903, however, when the province's territory shrank somewhat after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].

Population in British Columbia continued to expand as the province's [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fishery|fishing]] sectors were developed. Mining activity was particularly notable throughout the Mainland, particularly in the [[Boundary Country]], in the [[Slocan Valley|Slocan]], in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]] around [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], the East Kootenay (the southeast corner of the province), the Fraser Canyon, the [[Cariboo District|Cariboo]], the [[Omineca Country|Omineca]] and the [[Cassiar Country|Cassiar]], so much so a common epithet for the Mainland, even after provincehood, was &quot;the Gold Colony&quot;.&lt;!--cite is the Akriggs, and Howay, and Ormsby, and others--&gt; Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley, and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson River area, the Cariboo, the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]], and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.

The completion of the railway in 1885 was a huge boost to the province's economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, known as [[Gastown]], near the mouth of the [[Burrard Inlet]] was selected as the terminus of the railway, prompting the incorporation of the City as Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the [[Port of Vancouver]] spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], as the largest in [[Western Canada]]. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically, its settlement and development—were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources (such as the fishery). 

Establishing a [[labor force|labour force]] to develop the province was problematic from the start, and British Columbia was the locus of immigration from Europe, [[China]], and [[Japan]]. The influx of a non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation (much of it successful) to restrict the ability of [[Asian people]] to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of a [[Poll tax|head tax]]. This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. By 1923, almost all [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese immigration had been blocked]] except for merchants, professionals, students and investors.

Meanwhile, the province continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line, the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk Pacific]], linking north-central British Columbia from the [[Yellowhead Pass]] through Prince George to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] was driven at [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]]. This opened up the [[British Columbia Coast|North Coast]] and the [[Bulkley Valley]] region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.

===1920s through 1940s===
When the men returned from [[World War I]], they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hard-core drinking that Vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war. Because of pressure from veterans, prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the &quot;soldier and the working man&quot; could enjoy a drink, but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of &quot;soldier parties&quot; to represent their interests, variously named Soldier-Farmer, Soldier-Labour, and [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Farmer-Labour]] Parties. These formed the basis of the fractured labour-political spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties, including those who would eventually form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-operative Commonwealth]] and the early [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] splinter groups.
[[Image:Japanese internment camp in British Columbia.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Canadian internment|Internment camp]] for the [[Japanese Canadians]] during [[World War II]]]]

The advent of [[prohibition in the United States]] created new opportunities, and many found employment or at least profit in cross-border liquor smuggling. Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this &quot;pirate economy&quot;, although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. The end of U.S. prohibition, combined with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], plunged the province into economic destitution. Compounding the already dire local economic situation, tens of thousands of men from colder parts of Canada swarmed into Vancouver, creating huge [[hobo]] jungles around [[False Creek]] and the Burrard Inlet [[Classification yard|rail yards]], including the old Canadian Pacific Railway mainline [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] through the heart of the [[Downtown Vancouver|city's downtown]] (at Hastings and Carrall). Increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts, an occupation of the main Post Office at [[Granville Street|Granville]] and [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of [[martial law]] on the docks for almost three years. A Vancouver contingent for the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] was organized and seized a train, which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a [[Gatling gun]] straddling the tracks at [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]; the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;''Carved From Wood; Mission BC 1861-1992'', Andreas Schroeder, publ.

There were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce as never before.

British Columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the Pacific Ocean to have close relations with [[East Asia]]. However, this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward Asian immigrants. This was most manifest during the Second World War when many people of [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese descent were relocated]] or interned in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] of the province. Conversely, there have also been historically high rates of intermarriage and other examples of inter-racial harmony, cooperation and integration.

===Coalition and the post-War boom===
[[Image:British Columbia Regiment 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own) (RCAC)|BC Regiment, DCO]], marching in [[New Westminster]], 1940.]]
During [[World War II]] the mainstream [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] and [[British Columbia Conservative Party|BC Conservative]] Parties of British Columbia united in a formal [[coalition government]] under new Liberal leader [[John Hart (Canadian politician)|John Hart]], who replaced [[Thomas Dufferin Pattullo|Duff Pattullo]] when the latter failed to win a majority in the [[British Columbia general election, 1941|1941 election]]. While the Liberals won the most number of seats, they actually received fewer votes than the socialist [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). Pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival Conservatives led by [[Royal Maitland]] and was replaced by Hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five Liberal and three Conservative ministers.&lt;ref name=con/&gt; The CCF was invited to join the coalition but refused.&lt;ref name=con/&gt; 

The pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of World War II was to prevent the CCF, which had won a surprise victory in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1944, from ever coming to power in British Columbia. The CCF's popular vote was high enough in the [[British Columbia general election, 1945|1945 election]] that they were likely to have won three-way contests and could have formed government. However, the coalition prevented that by uniting the anti-[[socialism|socialist]] vote.&lt;ref name=con/&gt; In the post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the completion of [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] north of Prince George to the Peace River Block, a section called the John Hart Highway and also public hospital insurance.

In 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken over by [[Byron Ingemar Johnson]]. The Conservatives had wanted their new leader [[Herbert Anscomb]] to be premier, but the Liberals in the Coalition refused. Johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in British Columbia history (61%) in the [[British Columbia general election, 1949|1949 election]]. This victory was attributable to the popularity of his government's spending programmes, despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power. During his tenure, major infrastructure continued to expand, and the agreement with [[Rio Tinto Alcan|Alcan]] to build the [[Kemano, British Columbia|Kemano]]-[[Kitimat, British Columbia|Kitimat]] [[hydroelectricity|hydro]] and aluminum complex was put in place. Johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the 1948 flooding of the Fraser Valley, which was a major blow to that region and to the province's economy.

Increasing tension between the Liberal and Conservative coalition partners led the Liberal Party executive to vote to instruct Johnson to terminate the arrangement. Johnson ended the coalition and dropped his Conservative cabinet ministers, including [[Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy Premier]] and [[Finance minister|Finance Minister]] Herbert Anscomb, precipitating the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|general election of 1952]].&lt;ref name=con&gt;Hans J.

Smith]'', University of Toronto Press (2006), page 184&lt;/ref&gt; A referendum on electoral reform &lt;!--in 1950? I think; BC referenda/plebiscites need a history/list article of their own--&gt; prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a [[preferential voting|preferential ballot]]), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%. 

The Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA [[W. A. C. Bennett]], formed a [[minority government]] backed by the Liberals and Conservatives (with 6 and 4 seats respectively). Bennett began a series of fiscal reforms, preaching a new variety of [[populism]] as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development, laying the ground for a [[British Columbia general election, 1953|second election in 1953]] in which the new Bennett regime secured a majority of seats, with 38% of the vote.  Secure with that majority, Bennett returned the province to the first-past-the-post system thereafter, which is still in use today.

===Growth of government in the economy===
[[Image:I 61926.gif|left|thumb|upright|Premier [[W. A. C. Bennett]] and his wife accompany [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] in Victoria, August 1958. Bennett's Socreds governed the province for an unprecedented twenty years]]

With the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked a phase of rapid [[economic development]]. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.

During these two decades, the government [[nationalization|nationalized]] British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity [[BC Hydro]]. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Columbia, and [[Nechako River]] watersheds. Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the [[Columbia River Treaty]] between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.

The 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established [[BC Ferries]] as a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]], in order to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.

Vancouver and Victoria become cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and ''haute cuisine'' chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures. Similarly, these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics, commentators, and creative thinkers.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Tourism also began to play an important role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a great boost to British Columbia's economy.

Politically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the [[labour movement]], sharpened as so-called [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] parties coalesced into the defacto coalition represented by Social Credit—in opposition to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party]], the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between [[hippie]]s and [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver mayor]] [[Tom Campbell (Canadian politician)|Tom Campbell]] was particularly legendary, culminating in the so-called [[Gastown Riots]] of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.

===1970s and 1980s===
On August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector. However, BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061020072258/http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf | archivedate= 2006-10-20 | title= Electoral History of British Columbia 1871–1986 | author= Elections BC | year= 1998 | accessdate= 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) government under [[Dave Barrett]]. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its &quot;[[two sets of books]]&quot;, as WAC Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three year (&quot;Thousand Days&quot;) period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]], a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.

[[Image:Flaggraphic22.JPG|thumb|250px|right|This stylized version of the flag of BC was introduced by the Bennett government in the early 1980s. It remained as the logo of the government of BC for 20 years.]]Perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the [[British Columbia general election, 1975|1975 general election]]. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[Bill Bennett]], was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from [[Government Reserve]] to management by the [[Ministry of Forests]], reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP—notably the creation of the [[Whistler, British Columbia|Resort Municipality of Whistler]], whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC. 

Also during the &quot;MiniWac&quot; regime (a reference to his father's acronym-cum-nickname, WAC) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were &quot;privatized&quot; in a mass giveaway of shares in the [[British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation]], &quot;BCRIC&quot;, with the &quot;Brick shares&quot; soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several [[megaproject]]s meant to stimulate the economy and win votes - unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practiced government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of [[Expo 86]], to which was tied the construction of the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] and Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the [[Doman Scandal]], in which the Premier and millionaire backer [[Herb Doman]] were investigated for insider-trading and [[securities fraud]]. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.

[[File:Coquilhalla Highway.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The road was one of the legacies of [[Expo 86]]. The creation of the [[toll road|toll highway]] sparked controversy.]]
As the province entered a sustained [[recession]], Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Henry Pybus Bell-Irving]], was forced to call Bennett to [[Government House (British Columbia)|Government House]] to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]] no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, and backed by the support and computer-organization tactics of the [[Big Blue Machine]] from Ontario and other consultants who were electoral lobbyists for the American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bennett won an unexpected majority. 

After several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|House]] was finally called and in the [[speech from the throne|speech from the Throne]] the Socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed &quot;restraint&quot;, which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to &quot;motherhood&quot; issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people. 

This became known as the 1983 [[Solidarity Crisis]], from the name of the [[Solidarity Coalition]], a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour]] forming a separate organization of unions, [[Operation Solidarity]], under the direction of [[Jack Munro]], then-President of the [[International Woodworkers of America]] (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a [[general strike]] would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at [[Pacific Press Publishing Association|Pacific Press]] ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Palmer| first =Bryan| title =Solidarity: The Rise and Fall of an Opposition in British Columbia| publisher =New Star Books| year= 1987| location =Vancouver| id = ISBN }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party [[grande dame]] [[Grace McCarthy]], and the charismatic but eccentric [[Bill Vander Zalm]].

Bill Vander Zalm became the new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a [[conflict of interest]] scandal following the sale of [[Fantasy Gardens]], a [[Christian]] and [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]] [[Amusement park|theme park]] built by the Premier, to [[Tan Yu]], a [[Filipino Chinese]] gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor [[Faye Leung]] of a party in the &quot;Howard Hughes Suite&quot; on the top two floors of the [[Bayshore Inn]], where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a [[bag of money]] in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and [[Rita Johnston]] became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor [[Mike Harcourt]].

In 1988, [[David Lam]] was appointed by the [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] as British Columbia’s twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor, and was the Province's first Lieutenant-Governor of Chinese origin.

===1990s to present===
Johnston lost the [[British Columbia general election, 1991|1991 general election]] to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular, and helped boost the province's growing [[tourism]] sector. However, the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over &quot;[[Bingogate]]&quot;—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. [[Glen Clark]], a former president of the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour|BC Federation of Labour]], was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the [[Fast Ferry Scandal]] involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the Premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as Premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by [[Dan Miller (Canadian politician)|Dan Miller]] who was in turn followed by [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] following a leadership convention. 

In the 2001 general election [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell's]] BC Liberals defeated the NDP party, gaining 77 out of 79 seats total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the &quot;fast ferries&quot; project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of [[BC Rail]] to CN Rail. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] during a vacation in Hawaii. However, Campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 general election, against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009]], marking the first time in 23 years that a premier has been elected to a third term.

The province successfully won a bid to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver and Whistler, with Olympic organizers winning a referendum held in the city of Vancouver.

British Columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to the [[People's Republic of China]]. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades, because of its image of natural beauty, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but is particularly true during periods of economic growth. As a result, British Columbia has moved from approximately 10% of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13% in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean that the [[Greater Vancouver]] area now includes 51% of the Province's population, followed in second place by [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] with 8%. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.

Though just 1.8% refer to their origins as being &quot;British&quot;, a majority 57.3% of the population of British Columbia claim their ethnic origin as being from one of the British nations (England, Scotland or Wales). Another 15.2% refer to their ethnicity as &quot;Irish&quot;, though not distinguishing between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Of the provinces, British Columbia had the highest proportion of [[visible minority|visible minorities]], representing 24.8% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/ethnicorigin/british.cfm &quot;Statistics Canada. &quot;Canada’s Ethnocultural Mosaic, 2006 Census: Provinces and territories&quot;&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asian people|Asians]] are by far the largest visible minority demographic, with many of the Lower Mainland's large cities having sizable Chinese, [[South Asia]]n, Japanese, [[Philippines|Filipino]], and Korean communities.

Also present in large numbers relative to other regions of Canada (except [[Toronto]]), and ever since the province was first settled (unlike Toronto), are many European ethnicities of the first and second generation, notably [[Canadians of German ethnicity|Germans]], [[Scandinavians]], [[Demographics of SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavs]] and [[Italian Canadians|Italians]]. Third-generation Europeans are generally of mixed lineage, and traditionally intermarried with other ethnic groups more than in any other Canadian province. First-generation [[British people|Britons]] remain a strong component of local society despite limitations on [[immigration]] from Britain since the ending of special status for British subjects in the 1960s.

Of the 4,113,847 population counted by the 2006 census, 4,074,385 people completed the section about language. Of these 4,022,045 gave singular responses to the question regarding [[First language|mother tongue]]. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

==Economy==
[[File:Vancouver downtown.jpg|thumb|thumb|right|A view of the downtown core. [[Vancouver]] is the business capital of British Columbia]]
British Columbia has a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with increasing importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. With its film industry known as [[Hollywood North]], the Vancouver region is the third-largest feature film production location in North America, after [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm Film and Development | title= Film and TV | author= Vancouver Economic Development | year= 2005 | accessdate= 2007-04-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070101014505/http://vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm |archivedate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of [[Business cycle|dramatic upswings and downswings]], and this [[boom and bust]] pattern has influenced the politics, culture and business climate of the province. Economic activity related to mining in particular has widely fluctuated with changes in commodity prices over time, with documented costs to community health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2005/05oct06/mining.html | title= Hard on Health of Mining Communities | author= University of British Columbia | authorlink = University of British Columbia | month= September | year=2006 | accessdate= 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Columbia's GDP is the fourth largest in Canada at C$197.93 billion in 2008. GDP per capita stands at C$45,150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/econ15-eng.htm |title=Gross domestic product, expenditure-based, by province and territory |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Columbia’s total debt will rise 16% to C$47.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year, or 24.3% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0218838520100302 British Columbia sets budget, eyes Olympic costs]&quot;. Reuters. March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Transportation played a major role in British Columbia history. The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route that the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around [[Cape Horn]] or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.

Until the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the [[Crowsnest Highway|Crowsnest Pass Highway]]), and later the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.

===Roads and highways===
{{Main|List of British Columbia provincial highways}}
[[Image:AlexFraserBridge.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Alex Fraser Bridge]] on [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] in Richmond/Delta.]]

Because of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now freeways in the Lower Mainland and Central Interior of the province, and much of the rest of the province is accessible by well-maintained two lane [[arterial road|arterial highways]] with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the provincial government.

There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: [[British Columbia provincial highway 3|BC Highway 3]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], the [[Vermilion Pass]] and the [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through [[Banff National Park]], the [[Yellowhead Highway]] through [[Jasper National Park]], and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] through [[Dawson Creek]]. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running {{convert|2081|km|abbr=on}} from the British Columbia-Washington border at [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] north to [[Watson Lake, Yukon]] and which includes the British Columbia portion of the [[Alaska Highway]].

===Public transit===
Prior to 1978, surface [[public transport|public transit]] was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established [[BC Transit]] to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority ([[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]) (now South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority), a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District was established.

Public transit in British Columbia consists mainly of diesel buses, although Vancouver is also serviced by a fleet of [[trolleybus]]es. Several experimental buses are being tested such as [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] buses that has both gasoline and electric engines. TransLink operates [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], a [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit|rapid transit]] system serving Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, North Surrey and Richmond. Presently, extensions of the line east to Coquitlam and [[Port Moody]] (the [[Evergreen Line (Vancouver)|Evergreen Line]]) are being developed.

===Rail===
[[Image:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|upright|left|CPR train traversing the [[Stoney Creek Bridge]].]]

Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in 1885 and was the chief mode of long-distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the 1950s. Two major routes through the Yellowhead Pass competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway—the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], terminating at [[Prince Rupert]], and the [[Canadian National Railway]], terminating at Vancouver. 

The [[Pacific Great Eastern]] line supplemented this service, providing a north-south route between Interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] with [[North Vancouver, British Columbia (city)|North Vancouver]]. The E&amp;N Railway, rebranded as [[Southern Railway of Vancouver Island]], serves the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island by owning the physical rail lines. Passenger train service on Vancouver Island is operated by [[Via Rail]].

===Water===
[[BC Ferries]] was established as a provincial crown corporation in 1960 to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It now operates 25 routes among the [[List of islands of British Columbia|islands of British Columbia]], as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the [[Washington State Ferries]] (between [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]]) and [[MV Coho|Black Ball Transport]] (between Victoria and [[Port Angeles, Washington]]). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the provincial government.

Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are located at Vancouver, [[Roberts Bank]] (near [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]), Prince Rupert, and Victoria. Of these, the Port of Vancouver is the most important, being the largest in Canada and the most diversified in North America. Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for [[cruise ship]]s. In 2007, a large maritime [[Containerization|container port]] was opened in [[Prince Rupert Port Authority|Prince Rupert]] with an inland sorting port located in Prince George.

===Air===
{{Main|List of airports in British Columbia}}
There are over 200 airports located throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the [[Vancouver International Airport]], the [[Victoria International Airport]], the [[Kelowna International Airport]], and the [[Abbotsford International Airport]], the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. Vancouver International Airport is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|2nd busiest airport]] in the country with an estimated 17.9 million travellers passing through in 2008.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of British Columbia |Monarchy in British Columbia}}
[[Image:BC Legislature Buildings and Undersea Gardens.jpg|thumb|The British Columbia Parliament Buildings in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]]]

The Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, [[Steven Point]], is the Queen of Canada's representative in the Province of British Columbia. During the absence of the [[Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant-Governor]], the [[Cabinet of Canada|Governor General in Council]] may appoint an administrator to execute the duties of the office. In practice, this is usually the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|Chief Justice of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html#provincial Executive Power in the Provinces] under the Constitutional Act, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

British Columbia has an 85-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the [[plurality voting system]], though in recent years there has been significant debate about switching to a [[BC-STV|single transferable vote]] system.

The province is governed by the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] under Premier [[Christy Clark]]. The previous election saw ''then'' Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] win a third straight majority government in May 2009, taking 49 seats to the opposition [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]]'s 35. Campbell had previously led the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats, but the legislature has been more evenly divided between Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 of 79) and 2009 (49 of 85) provincial elections. The [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) and its predecessor the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|CCF]] have been the main opposition force to business-oriented parties since the 1930s and have ruled majority governments 1972-1975 and 1991-2001. The [[Green Party of British Columbia]] plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green Parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. However, after a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39%), the party's vote share has declined (2005 – 9.17%, 2009 – 8.09%).

The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been [[third party (politics)|third parties]] present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975), but there are presently none.

Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries. In an April 2008 poll by polling firm [[Ipsos-Reid]], the BC Liberals were shown as having the support of 49% of voters, compared to 32% for the NDP.&lt;ref&gt;S. 23 of the Constitution Act (British Columbia) requires elections to be held on the second Tuesday in May every fourth year after May 2005.

British Columbia is known for having politically active labour [[trade union|unions]] who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.

British Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to [[McGowan's War]] in 1858–59). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the [[Robert Bonner (politician)|Robert Bonner]] Affair, the [[Fantasy Gardens]] scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era, the Bingogate scandal which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, the alleged scandal named [[Casinogate]] which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals have plagued the current Liberal government, but with little apparent effect on the electorate, including the Premier's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A Christmas Eve [[BC Legislature Raids|raid on the Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, has resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to an American company, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems.

==Recreation==
Given its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].

Water sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. [[Sea kayak]]ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its [[fjord]]s. [[Whitewater]] [[rafting]] and [[kayak]]ing are popular on many inland rivers. [[Sailing]] and [[Windsurfing|sailboarding]] are widely enjoyed.
[[Image:Whistler ice sailor.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ice sailing in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]]]

In winter, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] and [[telemark skiing]] are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality [[downhill]] [[skiing]] has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the [[Columbia Mountains]]. [[Snowboarding]] has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] downhill events were held in [[Whistler Blackcomb]] area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.

In Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for [[jogging|joggers]] and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the [[Bicycle gearing|ten-speed]] bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust [[mountain bike]], trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. [[Longboarding]] is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.

[[Equestrianism|Horseback riding]] is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for [[trail riding]], often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.

British Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[curling]] and [[figure skating]]. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and [[winter sport]]s.
[[Image:Cannabis sativa.jpg|thumb|upright|170px|left|A crop of Cannabis Sativa, or &quot;[[BC Bud]]&quot;.]]
Consistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of [[Luxury resort|lodges]], [[chalet]]s, [[bed and breakfast]]s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.

In certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting [[ecotourism]] in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the [[WWOOF]] Canada program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwoof.ca/|title=WWOOF&amp;nbsp;— Willing Workers on Organic Farms, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreational cannabis===
{{See also|Cannabis in British Columbia}}
A 2004 study (published 2006) by the [[University of Victoria]] Centre for Addictions Research of BC and [[Simon Fraser University]] Applied Research on Mental Health and Addictions indicated [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use is more widespread among British Columbians than other Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communications.uvic.ca/releases/release.php?display=release&amp;id=758|title=Cannabis Use Highest in BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[United Nations]] report published in July 2007 actually placed Quebec as the highest consumption province, citing 15.8% of Quebecers having used marijuana in a single year, versus 14.1% of Canadians nationally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=89dd1b3f-eaf2-4945-99d9-de420f19dbd5&amp;k=64745|title=Quebec gone to pot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in Canada being placed first in the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] in marijuana use. With the actual growing of marijuana, British Columbia is responsible for 40% of all cannabis produced in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=21fd2469-4720-417e-b4ff-9e889f5588e8|title=Canada leads 'rich' world in using marijuana: UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siddhārtha Gautama''' ([[Sanskrit]]: [[wikt:सिद्धार्थ|सिद्धार्थ]] [[wikt:गौतम|गौतम]]; [[Pali]]: '''Siddhattha Gotama''') was a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] teacher who founded [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/buddha.htm |title=The Buddha, His Life and Teachings |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most Buddhist traditions, he is regarded as the Supreme '''[[Buddhahood|Buddha]]''' (P. ''sammāsambuddha'', S. ''samyaksaṃbuddha'') of our age, &quot;Buddha&quot; meaning &quot;awakened one&quot; or &quot;the enlightened one.&quot; &lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Gautama, also known as ''Śākyamuni'' (&quot;Sage of the [[Shakya|Śākyas]]&quot;), is the primary figure in Buddhism, and accounts of his life, discourses, and [[Monasticism|monastic]] rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by [[oral tradition]], and first committed to writing about 400 years later.

He is also regarded as a god or prophet [[Gautama Buddha in world religions|in other world religions]] or denominations, including [[Hinduism]], [[Ahmadiyya Islam]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q78O1mjX2tMC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=ahmadiyya+buddha&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wbZHTbfyBcWYhQeO-eS9BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ahmadiyya%20buddha&amp;f=false Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat] Retrieved on February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bahá'í]] faith.

==Biography==
===Traditional biographies===
The primary sources for the life of Siddhārtha Gautama are in a variety of different and sometimes conflicting traditional biographies. These include the ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', ''[[Lalitavistara Sutra|Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'', ''[[Mahāvastu]]'', and the ''[[Nidanakatha|Nidānakathā]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, Mark 2005. p. 32&quot;&gt;Fowler, Mark. ''Zen Buddhism: beliefs and practices.'' Sussex Academic Press. 2005. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the ''Buddhacarita'' is the earliest full biography, an epic poem written by the poet [[Aśvaghoṣa]], and dating around the beginning of the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, Mark 2005. p. 32&quot;/&gt; The ''Lalitavistara Sūtra'' is the next oldest biography, a [[Mahāyāna]]/[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] biography dating to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karetzky, Patricia 2000&quot;&gt;Karetzky, Patricia. ''Early Buddhist Narrative Art.'' 2000. p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahāvastu'' from the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] [[Lokottaravada|Lokottaravāda]] sect is another major biography, composed incrementally until perhaps the 4th century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karetzky, Patricia 2000&quot;/&gt; Lastly, the ''Nidānakathā'' is from the [[Theravāda]] sect in [[Sri Lanka]], composed in the 5th century CE by [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]].&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald. ''Becoming the Buddha.'' 2004. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

From canonical sources, the [[Jataka tales|Jātaka tales]], ''[[Mahapadana Sutta|Mahāpadāna Sutta]]'' (DN 14), and the ''[[Acchariyaabbhuta Sutta]]'' (MN 123) include selective accounts that may be older, but are not full biographies. The Jātaka tales retell previous lives of Gautama as a [[bodhisattva]], and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;Schober, Juliane. ''Sacred biography in the Buddhist traditions of South and Southeast Asia.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2002. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahāpadāna Sutta'' and ''Acchariyaabbhuta Sutta'' both recount miraculous events surrounding Gautama's birth, such as the bodhisattva's descent from [[Tusita|Tuṣita]] Heaven into his mother's womb.

Traditional biographies of Gautama generally include numerous miracles, omens, and supernatural events. The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mahāvastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such &quot;in conformity with the world&quot;; omniscience, and the ability to &quot;suppress karma.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.J. ''The Mahāvastu'' (3 vols.) in ''Sacred Books of the Buddhists.'' London: Luzac &amp; Co. 1949–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a [[secular]] understanding of Siddhārtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.

The ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain]] scriptures, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full}} Karen Armstrong writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhārtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Karen | last=Armstrong | year=2000 | title=Buddha | publisher=Orion‬ | isbn=978-0-7538-1340-9 | page=xii | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of &quot;birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death&quot; must be true.&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full}}

===Conception and birth===

Gautama is thought to have been born in [[Lumbini]], in modern day Nepal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/lumbini.htm |title=Buddhanet.net |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in the small kingdom or principality of Kapilavastu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666 |title=UNESCO.org |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the most traditional biography,{{Which?|date=November 2010}} the Buddha's father was King [[Suddhodana]], the leader of [[Shakya]] clan, whose capital was Kapilavastu, and who were later annexed by the growing Kingdom of [[Kosala]] during the Buddha's lifetime; Gautama was the [[family name]]. His mother, [[Queen Maya|Queen Maha Maya]] (Māyādevī) and Suddhodana's wife, was a Koliyan princess. Legend has it that, on the night Siddhartha was conceived, Queen Maya dreamt that a [[white elephant]] with six white tusks entered her right side,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/lob/lob04.htm |title=Sacred-texts.com |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ten [[lunar month|months]] later Siddhartha was born. As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilvastu for her father's kingdom to give birth. However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a [[Shorea robusta|sal]] tree.

The day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in [[Theravada]] countries as [[Vesak]].&lt;ref&gt;Turpie, D. 2001. Wesak And The Re-Creation of Buddhist Tradition. Master's Thesis. Montreal, Quebec: McGill University. (p. 3). Available from: [http://www.mrsp.mcgill.ca/reports/pdfs/Wesak.pdf Mcgill.ca]. Retrieved 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (Pāli: Siddhattha), meaning &quot;he who achieves his aim&quot;. During the birth celebrations, the hermit [[Clairvoyance|seer]] [[Asita]] journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king ([[chakravartin]]) or a great [[sadhu|holy man]].&lt;ref name = &quot;narada&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last= Narada|title = A Manual of Buddhism|publisher= Buddha Educational Foundation|year= 1992| isbn=967-9920-58-5| page=9&amp;ndash;12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By traditional account,{{Which?|date=November 2010}} this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight [[brahmin]] scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man.&lt;ref name=narada/&gt; [[Kaundinya]] (Pali: Kondanna), the youngest, and later to be the first [[arahant]] other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Narada (1992), p11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

While later tradition and legend characterized Śuddhodana as a [[hereditary]] [[monarch]], the [[Kinship|descendant]] of the Solar Dynasty of [[Ikshvaku|{{IAST|Ikṣvāku}}]] (Pāli: Okkāka), many scholars think that Śuddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.

Early texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.'' Routledge 2000, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many small [[city-state]]s existed in [[History of India|Ancient India]], called [[Mahajanapadas|Janapadas]].  [[Republics]] and chiefdoms with diffused [[political power]] and limited [[social stratification]], were not uncommon amongst them, and were referred to as [[gana-sanghas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Romila Thapar]], ''The Penguin History of Early India: From Origins to AD 1300.'' Penguin Books, 2002, page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buddha's community does not seem to have had a [[caste system]]. It was not a monarchy, and seems to have been structured either as an [[oligarchy]], or as a form of republic.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gombrich, ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the [[Shramana]] type [[Jain]] and Buddhist [[sangha]]s, where monarchies tended toward [[Vedic Brahmanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India: From Origins to AD 1300.'' Penguin Books, 2002, page 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life and marriage===
Siddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Maha Pajapati]].&lt;ref name=&quot;narada_14&quot;&gt;Narada (1992), p14&lt;/ref&gt; By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince, and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. Although more recent scholarship doubts this status, his father, said to be King Śuddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human [[dukkha|suffering]].

When he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named [[Yashodhara|Yaśodharā]] (Pāli: Yasodharā). According to the traditional account,{{Which?|date=November 2010}} she gave birth to a son, named [[Rahula]]. Siddhartha is then said to have spent 29 years as a prince in [[Kapilavastu]]. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;narada_14&quot;&gt;Narada (1992), p14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure and ascetic life===
[[Image:Great Departure.JPG|thumb|left|This scene depicts the &quot;Great Departure&quot; of Sidhartha Gautama, a predestined being. He appears here surrounded by a halo, and accompanied by numerous guards,  mithuna loving couples, and devata, come to pay homage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guimet.fr/The-Great-Departure Guimet.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhara art, Kushan period(1st-3rd century CE)]]
[[Image:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Siddharta shaves his hair and become an ascetic. [[Borobudur]], 8th century.]]

At the age of 29, the popular biography continues, Siddhartha left his palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer [[Channa (Buddhist)|Channa]] explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a [[disease]]d man, a decaying [[Body|corpse]], and an [[Asceticism|ascetic]]. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome ageing, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;Conze (1959), pp39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanied by Channa and aboard his horse [[Kanthaka]], Gautama quit his palace for the life of a [[mendicant]]. It's said that, &quot;the horse's hooves were muffled by the gods&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Narada (1992), pp15-16&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent guards from knowing of his departure. 

Gautama initially went to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]] and began his ascetic life by begging for alms in the street. Having been recognised by the men of King [[Bimbisara]], Bimbisara offered him the throne after hearing of Siddhartha's quest. Siddhartha rejected the offer, but promised to visit his kingdom of [[Magadha]] first, upon attaining enlightenment.

He left Rajagaha and practised under two hermit teachers. After mastering the teachings of [[Alara Kalama]] (Skr. Ārāḍa Kālāma), he was asked by Kalama to succeed him. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practise, and moved on to become a student of [[Udaka Ramaputta]] (Skr. Udraka Rāmaputra).  With him he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, and was again asked to succeed his teacher.  But, once more, he was not satisfied, and again moved on.&lt;ref&gt;Narada (1992), pp19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Siddhartha and a group of five companions led by [[Kaundinya]] are then said to have set out to take their austerities even further. They tried to find enlightenment through deprivation of worldly goods, including food, practising [[Mortification of the flesh|self-mortification]]. After nearly starving himself to death by restricting his food intake to around a leaf or nut per day, he collapsed in a river while bathing and almost drowned. Siddhartha began to reconsider his path. Then, he remembered a moment in childhood in which he had been watching his father start the season's plowing. He attained a concentrated and focused state that was blissful and refreshing, the [[jhāna]].

===Enlightenment===
[[Image:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Victory Over Mara.jpeg|thumb|right|The Buddha sitting in meditation, surrounded by demons of [[Mara (demon)|Māra]]. Sanskrit manuscript. Nālandā, Bihar, India. Pāla period.]]

According to the early Buddhist texts,&lt;ref name=&quot;sn56&quot;&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion]&lt;/ref&gt; after realizing that meditative jhana was the right path to awakening, but that extreme asceticism didn't work, Gautama discovered what Buddhists call the [[Middle way|Middle Way]]&lt;ref name=&quot;sn56&quot;/&gt;&amp;mdash;a path of moderation away from the extremes of [[hedonism|self-indulgence]] and self-mortification.&lt;ref name=&quot;sn56&quot;/&gt; In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and [[rice pudding]] from a village girl named [[Sujata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;goldenbowl&quot;&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/lifebuddha/15lbud.htm The Golden Bowl]&lt;/ref&gt; Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldenbowl&quot;/&gt;

Following this incident, Gautama was famously seated under a [[Sacred fig|pipal]] tree - now known as the [[Bodhi tree]] - in [[Bodh Gaya]], [[India]], when he vowed never to arise until he had found the truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyatsobook&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Gyatso| first =Geshe Kelsang| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Introduction to Buddhism An Explanation of the Buddhist Way of Life | publisher =Tharpa| year =2007| location =| pages =8–9| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 978-0-9789067-7-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaundinya]] and four other  companions, believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined, left. After a reputed 49 days of meditation, at the age of 35, he is said to have attained [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gyatsobook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;basicteaching&quot;&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/footsteps.htm The Basic Teaching of Buddha]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some traditions, this occurred in approximately the fifth lunar month, while, according to others, it was in the twelfth month. From that time, Gautama was known to his followers as the ''Buddha'' or &quot;Awakened One.&quot; (&quot;Buddha&quot; is also sometimes translated as &quot;The Enlightened One.&quot;) He is often referred to in Buddhism as Shakyamuni Buddha, or &quot;The Awakened One of the Shakya Clan.&quot;

According to Buddhism, at the time of his awakening he realized complete insight into the cause of suffering, and the steps necessary to eliminate it. These discoveries became known as the &quot;[[Four Noble Truths]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;basicteaching&quot;/&gt; which are at the heart of Buddhist teaching. Through mastery of these truths, a state of supreme liberation, or [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]], is believed to be possible for any being. The Buddha described Nirvāna as the perfect peace of a mind that's free from ignorance, greed, hatred and other afflictive states,&lt;ref name=&quot;basicteaching&quot;/&gt; or &quot;defilements&quot; (kilesas). Nirvana is also regarded as the &quot;end of the world,&quot; in that no personal identity or boundaries of the mind remain. In such a state, a being is said to possess the [[Buddhahood#Ten Epithets|Ten Characteristics]], belonging to every Buddha.

According to a story in the ''[[Āyācana Sutta]]'' (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1) - a scripture found in the [[Pāli]] and other [[wiktionary:canon|canons]] - immediately after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he should teach the ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]'' to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahmā Sahampati|Brahmā Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.

===Formation of the sangha===
[[Image:Buddha nobletruths.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Painting of the first sermon depicted at [[Wat Chedi Liem]] in [[Thailand]].]]

After his awakening, the Buddha met two merchants, named [[Tapussa]] and [[Bhallika]], who became his first lay disciples. They were apparently each given hairs from his head, which are now claimed to be enshrined as relics in the [[Shwe Dagon]] Temple in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]]. The Buddha intended to visit [[Asita]], and his former teachers, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta]], to explain his findings, but they had already died.

He then travelled to the [[Sarnath|Deer Park]] near [[Varanasi|{{IAST|Vārāṇasī}}]] (Benares) in northern India, where he set in motion what Buddhists call the [[Dharmacakra|Wheel of Dharma]] by delivering his first sermon to the five companions with whom he had sought enlightenment. Together with him, they formed the first [[Sangha|{{IAST|saṅgha}}]]: the company of Buddhist monks.

All five become [[arahants]], and within the first two months, with the conversion of [[Yasa]] and fifty four of his friends, the number of such arahants is said to have grown to 60. The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, with their reputed 200, 300 and 500 disciples, respectively. This swelled the sangha to more than 1000.

===Travels and teaching===
[[Image:TheBuddhaAndVajrapaniGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Buddha with his protector [[Vajrapani]], [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]], 2nd century CE, Ostasiatische Kunst Museum]]

For the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the [[Gangetic Plain]], in what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and southern [[Nepal]], teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to [[Dalit (outcast)|outcaste]] street sweepers, murderers such as [[Angulimala]], and cannibals such as [[Alavaka]]. From the outset, Buddhism was equally open to all races and classes, and had no [[caste]] structure, as was the rule in Hinduism. Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it's likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, of which [[Pali]] may be a standardization.

The sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[vassana]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.

The first vassana was spent at [[Varanasi]] when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to [[Rajagaha]], capital of [[Magadha]], to visit King [[Bimbisara]]. During this visit, [[Sariputta]] and [[Mahamoggallana]] were converted by [[Assaji]], one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, capital of Magadha.

Upon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to [[Kapilavastu]]. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message, and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by [[Kaludayi]], a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.

Now two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:

{{quote|&quot;Ours is the warrior lineage of Mahamassata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms&quot;}}

The Buddha is said to have replied:

{{quote|&quot;That is not the custom of your royal lineage. But it is the custom of my Buddha lineage. Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking alms&quot;}}

Buddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk.  After this he is said to have become a [[sotapanna]]. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the [[sangha]]. The Buddha's cousins [[Ananda]] and [[Anuruddha]] became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son [[Rahula]] also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother [[Nanda]] also joined and became an arahant.

Of the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, Mahamoggallana, [[Mahakasyapa]], Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of [[Upali]], [[Subhoti]], Rahula, [[Mahakaccana]] and [[Punna]].

In the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near [[Vesali]] when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.

The king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother [[Maha Pajapati]], for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns.  He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules ([[Vinaya]]) to follow.

[[File:Devadatta attacking Buddha.jpg|thumb|left|Devadatta tries to attack the Buddha. Picture of a wallpainting in a Laotian monastery.]]

===Assassination attempts===
According to colorful legends, even during the Buddha's life the sangha was not free of dissent and discord. For example, [[Devadatta]], a cousin of Gautama who became a monk but not an arahant, more than once tried to kill him.

Initially, Devadatta is alleged to have often tried to undermine the Buddha. In one instance, according to stories, Devadatta even asked the Buddha to stand aside and let him lead the sangha. When this failed, he is accused of having three times tried to kill his teacher. The first attempt is said to have involved him hiring a group of archers to shoot the awakened one.  But, upon meeting the Buddha, they laid down their bows and instead became followers. A second attempt is said to have involved Devadatta rolling a boulder down a hill. But this hit another rock and splintered, only grazing the Buddha's foot. In the third attempt, Devadatta is said to have got an elephant drunk and set it loose. This ruse also failed.

After his lack of success at homicide, Devadatta is said to have tried to create a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the sangha, by proposing extra restrictions on the [[vinaya]]. When the Buddha again prevailed, Devadatta started a breakaway order. At first, he managed to convert some of the bhikkhus, but Sariputta and Mahamoggallana are said to have expounded the dharma so effectively that they were won back.

===Mahaparinirvana===
[[Image:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Buddha Parinirvana.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The Buddha's entry into [[Parinirvana]]. Sanskrit manuscript. Nālandā, Bihar, India. Pāla period.]]
[[Image:EndAscetism.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The sharing of the relics of the Buddha, Zenyōmitsu-Temple Museum, Tokyo]]

According to the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]] of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]]. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant [[Ananda|Ānanda]] to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html Maha-parinibbana Sutta] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 16), verse 56&lt;/ref&gt; Mettanando and von Hinüber argue that the Buddha died of [[Superior mesenteric artery syndrome|mesenteric]] [[infarction]], a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Mettanando Bhikkhu and Oskar von Hinueber, &quot;The Cause of the Buddha's Death&quot;; Vol. XXVI of the Journal of the Pali Text Society, 2000. See also this article by Mettanando saying the same thing: [http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm Buddhanet.net.]&lt;/ref&gt; The precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms; the [[Theravada]] tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the [[Mahayana]] tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom. These may reflect the different traditional views on [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] and the precepts for monks and nuns.

Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of [[Kushinagar|Kuśināra]] (present-day Kushinagar, [[India]]) of the [[Malla (India)|Malla]] kingdom. Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king that resounded with joy:

{{quote|''44.'' Kusavati, Ananda, resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds—the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of horses, the rattling of chariots, the beating of drums and tabours, music and song, cheers, the clapping of hands, and cries of &quot;Eat, drink, and be merry!&quot;}}

The Buddha then asked all the attendant [[Bhikkhu]]s to clarify any doubts or questions they had. They had none. According to Buddhist scrptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: &quot;All composite things pass away. Strive for your own liberation with diligence.&quot; His body was cremated and the [[relic]]s were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present. For example, The [[Temple of the Tooth]] or &quot;Dalada Maligawa&quot; in [[Sri Lanka]] is the place where what some believe to be the [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|relic of the right tooth of Buddha]] is kept at present.

According to the Pāli historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, the [[Dipavamsa|{{IAST|Dīpavaṃsa}}]] and [[Mahavamsa|{{IAST|Mahāvaṃsa}}]], the coronation of [[Ashoka the Great|Aśoka]] (Pāli: Asoka) is 218 years after the death of Buddha. According to two textual records in Chinese (十八部論 and 部執異論), the coronation of Aśoka is 116 years after the death of Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Theravāda record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Theravāda countries is 544 or 543 BCE, because the reign of Aśoka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates.

At his death, the Buddha is famously believed to have told his disciples to follow no leader. [[Mahakasyapa]] was chosen by the sangha to be the chairman of the [[First Buddhist Council]], with the two chief disciples [[Mahamoggallana]] and [[Sariputta]] having died before the Buddha.

==Physical characteristics==
{{Main|Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}
[[Image:Buddha Victoria &amp; Albert.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gandhāran depiction of the Buddha from Hadda, Central Asia. Victoria and Albert Museum, [[London]].]]

An extensive and colorful physical description of the Buddha has been laid down in scriptures. A [[kshatriya]] by birth, he had military training in his upbringing, and by Shakyan tradition was required to pass tests to demonstrate his worthiness as a warrior in order to marry. He had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general. He is also believed by Buddhists to have &quot;the 32 Signs of the Great Man&quot;.

The Brahmin Sonadanda described him as &quot;handsome, good-looking, and pleasing to the eye, with a most beautiful complexion. He has a godlike form and countenance, he is by no means unattractive.&quot;(D,I:115).

&quot;It is wonderful, truly marvellous, how serene is the good Gotama's appearance, how clear and radiant his complexion, just as the golden jujube in autumn is clear and radiant, just as a palm-tree fruit just loosened from the stalk is clear and radiant, just as an adornment of red gold wrought in a crucible by a skilled goldsmith, deftly beaten and laid on a yellow-cloth shines, blazes and glitters, even so, the good Gotama's senses are calmed, his complexion is clear and radiant.&quot; (A,I:181)

A disciple named Vakkali, who later became an Arahant, was so obsessed by Buddha's physical presence that the Buddha is said to have felt impelled tell him to desist, and to have reminded him that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.

Although there are no extant representations of the Buddha in human form until around the 1st century CE (see [[Buddhist art]]), descriptions of the physical characteristics of fully enlightened buddhas are attributed to the Buddha in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST|Lakkhaṇa Sutta}}'' (D,I:142).&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Walshe, ''The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya'', 1995, Boston: Wisdom Publications, &quot;[DN] 30: ''{{IAST|Lakkhaṇa Sutta}}'': The Marks of a Great Man,&quot; pp. 441-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Buddha's physical appearance is described by [[Yasodhara]] to their son [[Rahula]] upon the Buddha's first post-Enlightenment return to his former princely palace in the non-canonical Pali devotional hymn, ''Narasīha Gāthā'' (&quot;The Lion of Men&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Ven. Elgiriye Indaratana Maha Thera, ''Vandana: The Album of Pali Devotional Chanting and Hymns'', 2002, pp. 49-52, retrieved 2007-11-08 from [http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/vandana02.pdf Buddhanet.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 32 main characteristics it is mentioned that Buddha has [[blue eyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Ronald. ''Buddhist Text Translation Society's Buddhism A to Z.'' 2003. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that some portions of the [[Pali Canon]] and the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] contain the actual substance of the historical teachings (and possibly even the words) of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;''It is therefore possible that much of what is found in the Suttapitaka is earlier than c.250 B.C., perhaps even more than 100 years older than this. If some of the material is so old, it might be possible to establish what texts go back to the very beginning of Buddhism, texts which perhaps include the substance of the Buddha’s teaching, and in some cases, maybe even his words.'' How old is the Suttapitaka? Alexander Wynne, St John’s College, 2003, p.22 (this article is available on the website of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies: [www.ocbs.org/research/Wynne.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism ... the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas.'' J.W. De Jong, 1993: ''The Beginnings of Buddhism'', in The Eastern Buddhist, vol. 26, no. 2, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the case for the later [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mahayana movement claims to have been founded by the Buddha himself. The consensus of the evidence, however, is that it originated in South India in the 1st century CE''–Indian Buddhism, AK Warder, 3rd edition, 1999, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptural works of [[Early Buddhism]] precede the Mahayana works chronologically, and are treated by many Western scholars as the main credible source for information regarding the actual historical teachings of Gautama Buddha. However, some scholars do not think that the texts report on historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Bareau, André, Les récits canoniques des funérailles du Buddha et leurs anomalies : nouvel essai d'interprétation, BEFEO, t. LXII, Paris, 1975, pp.151-189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bareau, André, La composition et les étapes de la formation progressive du Mahaparinirvanasutra ancien, BEFEO, t. LXVI, Paris, 1979, pp. 45-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shimoda, Masahiro, How has the Lotus Sutra Created Social Movements: The Relationship of the Lotus Sutra to the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra, in ''A Buddhist Kaleidoscope'', (pp320-22) Ed Gene Reves, Kosei 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the fundamentals of the teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha are:
*The [[Four Noble Truths]]: that suffering is an ingrained part of existence; that the origin of suffering is craving for sensuality, acquisition of identity, and annihilation; that suffering can be ended; and that following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is the means to accomplish this.
*The Noble Eightfold Path: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.
*[[Pratitya-samutpada|Dependent origination]]: the mind creates suffering as a natural product of a complex process.
*Rejection of the [[infallibility]] of accepted [[scripture]]: Teachings should not be accepted unless they are borne out by our experience and are praised by the wise. See the ''[[Kalama Sutta]]'' for details.
*''[[Anicca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''anitya''): That all things that come to be have an end.
*''[[Dukkha]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}''): That nothing which comes to be is ultimately satisfying.
*''[[Anatta|Anattā]]'' (Sanskrit: ''anātman''): That nothing in the realm of experience can really be said to be &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;.
*''[[Nibbana|Nibbāna]]'' (Sanskrit: ''Nirvāna''): It is possible for sentient beings to realize a dimension of awareness which is totally unconstructed and peaceful, and end all suffering due to the mind's interaction with the conditioned world.

However, in some Mahayana schools, these points have come to be regarded as more or less subsidiary. There is disagreement amongst various [[schools of Buddhism]] over more complex aspects of what the Buddha is believed to have taught, and also over some of the [[Vinaya|disciplinary rules]] for monks.

According to tradition, the Buddha emphasized ethics and correct understanding. He questioned everyday notions of divinity and salvation. He stated that there is no intermediary between mankind and the [[Divinity|divine]]; distant gods are subjected to [[karma]] themselves in decaying heavens; and the Buddha is only a guide and teacher for beings who must tread the path of [[Nirvana (concept)|{{IAST|Nirvāṇa}}]] ([[Pāli]]: Nibbāna) themselves to attain the spiritual awakening called ''[[bodhi]]'' and understand reality. The Buddhist system of insight and [[meditation]] practice is not claimed to have been divinely revealed, but to spring from an understanding of the true nature of the mind, which must be discovered by treading the path guided by the Buddha's teachings.

==Sambuddhatva jayanthi==
[[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]](also known as Sambuddha jayanthi) is a religious festival in relation with the Wesak full moon poya day. In buddhist world it is celebrated in several theravada countries including Sri Lanka, India and in buddhist communities of other countries.

Gautama Buddha is also described as a god or prophet in [[Gautama Buddha in world religions|other religions]]. Some Hindu texts say that the Buddha was an [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|avatar of the god Vishnu]], who came to Earth to delude beings away from the Vedic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| year=1997 | chapter=Buddha as depicted in the Purāṇas |  title = Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, Volume 7 | author1=Nagendra Kumar Singh | publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.

The [[Bhavishya Purana]] contains the following: &quot;At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the [[Shakyamuni]], and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years. Then Shuddodana ruled for twenty years, and Shakyasimha for twenty. At the first stage of the [[Kali Yuga|Kali Age]], the path of the Vedas was destroyed and all men became Buddhists. Those who sought refuge with Vishnu were deluded.&quot; Found in Wendy O'Flaherty, ''Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology.'' University of California Press, 1976, page 203.

[[Image:Sio se pol.jpg|thumb|right|337px|The [[Si-o-se Pol]] bridge over [[Zayandeh River]] is the epitome of [[Safavid dynasty]] (1502–1722) bridge design. [[Esfahan]], [[Iran]]]]

A '''bridge''' is a [[structure]] built to [[span (architecture)|span]] physical obstacles such as a [[body of water]], [[valley]], or [[road]], for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed, the material used to make it and the funds available to build it.

==Etymology==
The Oxford English Dictionary traces the origin of the word ''bridge'' to an Old English word ''brycg'', of the same meaning, derived from a hypothetical [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''brugjō''. There are [[cognate]]s in other Germanic languages.

The first bridges were made by nature itself — as simple as a log fallen across a stream or stones in the river. The first bridges made by humans were probably spans of cut wooden logs or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and crossbeam arrangement. Some early Americans used trees or bamboo poles to cross small caverns or wells to get from one place to another. A common form of lashing sticks, logs, and deciduous branches together involved the use of long reeds or other harvested fibers woven together to form a connective rope capable of binding and holding together the materials used in early bridges.

The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] is one of four [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[corbel arch]] bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate chariots, between [[Tiryns]] to [[Epidauros]] in the [[Peloponnese]], in [[Greece]]. Dating to the Greek [[Bronze Age]] (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.
Several intact arched stone bridges from the [[Hellenistic age|Hellenistic era]] can be found in the [[Peloponnese]] in southern [[Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;T.H. Nielsen and J. Roy. ''Defining ancient Arkadia: symposium April 1–4, 1998. Kgl. Danske Videnskabernes Selska, 1998. p. 253. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa9IFGkrhi8C&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=Hellenistic+Bridge+Xerokampi&amp;ei=96aQS9L2FaSclQT5m6SpDQ&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Hellenistic%20Bridge%20Xerokampi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest bridge builders of antiquity were the [[Roman Engineering|ancient Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org/studies/bridges.htm Context for World Heritage Bridges]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built [[arch bridges]] and [[aqueduct]]s that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs. Some stand today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab97 History of BRIDGES]&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Alcántara Bridge]], built over the river [[Tagus]], in [[Spain]]. The Romans also used [[cement]], which reduced the variation of strength found in natural stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubs.asce.org/WWWdisplay.cgi?0103045 Lessons from Roman Cement and Concrete]&lt;/ref&gt; One type of cement, called [[pozzolana]], consisted of water, lime, sand, and [[volcanic rock]]. [[Brick]] and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] bridges were built after the Roman era, as the technology for cement was lost then later rediscovered.

The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' of [[Kautilya]] mentions the construction of dams and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshitar, pg. 332&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Mauryan]] bridge near [[Girnar]] was surveyed by [[James Prinsep|James Princep]].&lt;ref name=Dutt/&gt; The bridge was swept away during a flood, and later repaired by Puspagupta, the chief architect of emperor [[Chandragupta I]].&lt;ref name=Dutt/&gt; The bridge also fell under the care of the [[Yavana]] Tushaspa, and the [[Satrap]] Rudra Daman.&lt;ref name=Dutt&gt;Dutt, pg 46&lt;/ref&gt; The use of stronger bridges using plaited bamboo and iron chain was visible in India by about the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;suspension bridge&quot; in Encyclopaedia Britannica (2008). 2008 Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of bridges, both for military and commercial purposes, were constructed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] administration in India.&lt;ref&gt;Nath, pg. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the [[Warring States]], the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]], built from 595 to 605 AD during the [[Sui Dynasty]]. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest open-[[spandrel]] stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the [[Alconétar Bridge]] (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era [[Trajan's Bridge]] (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.

[[Rope bridge]]s, a simple type of suspension bridge, were used by the [[Inca]] civilization in the [[Andes]] mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.

During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by [[Hans Ulrich]], [[Johannes Grubenmann]], and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by [[Hubert Gautier]] in 1716. A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of [[the Iron Bridge]] in [[Coalbrookdale]], England in 1779. It used [[cast iron]] for the first time as arches to cross the [[river Severn]].

With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, [[truss]] systems of [[wrought iron]] were developed for larger bridges, but iron did not have the [[tensile strength]] to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a high tensile strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of [[Gustave Eiffel]].

In 1927 [[welding]] pioneer [[Stefan Bryła]] designed the first welded road bridge in the world, which was later built across the river [[:pl:Słudwia (rzeka)|Słudwia Maurzyce]] near [[Łowicz, Poland]] in 1929. In 1995, the [[American Welding Society]] presented the Historic Welded Structure Award for the bridge to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/welding/wh_1900-1950.html|title=Welding Timeline 1900-1950|last=Sapp|first=Mark E.|date=February 22, 2008|publisher=WeldingHistory.org|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of bridges==
There are six main types of bridges: [[beam bridge]]s, [[cantilever bridge]]s, [[arch bridge]]s, [[suspension bridge]]s, [[cable-stayed bridge]]s and [[truss bridge]]s.

===Beam bridges===
[[Beam bridge]]s are horizontal beams supported at each end by abutments, hence their structural name of ''[[simply supported]]''. When there is more than one span the intermediate supports are known as [[bridge pier|pier]]s. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges are large box steel girder bridges. Weight on top of the beam pushes straight down on the abutments at either end of the bridge.&lt;ref name=beambridge&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | title=Beam bridges | publisher=Design Technology | accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are made up mostly of wood or metal.  Beam bridges typically do not exceed {{convert|250|ft|m}} long.  The longer the bridge, the weaker.  The world's longest beam bridge is [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] in southern [[Louisiana]] in the United States, at {{convert|23.83|mi|km|abbr=off}}, with individual spans of {{convert|56|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=28 May 1956|title=A big prefabricated bridge|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|volume=40|issue=22|pages=53–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantilever bridges===
[[Cantilever bridge]]s are built using [[cantilever]]s—horizontal beams supported on only one end. Most cantilever bridges use a pair of [[continuous span]]s that extend from opposite sides of the supporting piers to meet at the center of the obstacle the bridge crosses. Cantilever bridges are constructed using much the same materials &amp; techniques as beam bridges. The difference comes in the action of the forces through the bridge. The largest cantilever bridge is the {{convert|549|m|adj=on}} [[Quebec Bridge]] in Quebec, Canada.

===Arch bridges===
[[Arch bridge]]s have [[abutments]] at each end. The earliest known arch bridges were built by the Greeks, and include the [[Arkadiko Bridge]]. The weight of the bridge is thrust into the [[abutments]] at either side. [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] is currently building the [[Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Crossing]], which is scheduled for completion in 2012.  When completed, it will be the largest arch bridge in the world.&lt;ref name=dubai&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/509621-worlds-longest-arch-bridge-for-dubai?ln=en | publisher=Arabian Business | accessdate=2008-05-14 | title=Dubai to build world's longest arch bridge | first=Amy | last=Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension bridges===
[[Suspension bridge]]s are suspended from cables. The earliest suspension bridges were made of ropes or vines covered with pieces of bamboo. In modern bridges, the cables hang from towers that are attached to caissons or cofferdams. The caissons or cofferdams are implanted deep into the floor of a lake or river. The longest suspension bridge in the world is the {{convert|12826|ft}} [[Akashi Kaikyo Bridge]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=suspension&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/story.asp?story=8153&amp;headline=The%20Mighty%20Mac:%20A%20Sublime%20Engineering%20Feat | title=The Mighty Mac: A Sublime Engineering Feat | first=Pete | last=Sigmund | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | date=2007-02-07 | accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[simple suspension bridge]], [[stressed ribbon bridge]], [[underspanned suspension bridge]], [[suspended-deck suspension bridge]], and [[self-anchored suspension bridge]].

===Cable-stayed bridges===
[[Cable-stayed bridge]]s, like suspension bridges, are held up by cables. However, in a cable-stayed bridge, less cable is required and the towers holding the cables are proportionately shorter.&lt;ref name=cable&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/eng99/eng99373.htm | title=Cable Stay vs Suspension Bridges | first=Andy | last=Johnson | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known cable-stayed bridge was designed in 1784 by C.T. Loescher.&lt;ref name=loescher&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bridges/reconstruction.shtml | title=Bridges | publisher=NYCDOT | accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest cable-stayed bridge is the [[Sutong Bridge]] over the Yangtze River in China.

===Movable bridges===
[[Movable bridge]]s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.

===Double-decked bridges===
Double-decked or double-decker bridges have two levels, such as the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]], with two road levels. [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] in [[Hong Kong]] have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for [[MTR]] metro trains. Likewise, in [[Toronto]], the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] has four lanes of motor traffic on its upper deck and a pair of tracks for the [[Bloor–Danforth line|Bloor–Danforth]] [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line]]. Some double-decker bridges only use one level for street traffic; the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] reserves its lower level for automobile traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the [[University of Minnesota]]).

[[Robert Stephenson]]'s [[High Level Bridge]] across the [[River Tyne]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-deck bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Another example is [[Craigavon Bridge]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Oresund Bridge]] between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]] consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level.

The [[George Washington Bridge]] between New Jersey and New York has two roadway levels. It was built with only the upper roadway as traffic demands did not require more capacity.  A [[truss]] work between the roadway levels provides stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when installed. [[Tower Bridge]] is different example of a double-decker bridge, with the central section consisting of a low level [[Bascule bridge|bascule span]] and a high level [[footbridge]].

Old Yamuna Bridge ([[Delhi]]) or Bridge No. 249 in technical railway parlance, was constructed in 1866 by the East India Railway at a cost of £16,16,335. It was built with a total length of {{convert|2640|ft}} and consisted of 12 spans of {{convert|202.5|ft}} each. With the completion of this bridge, two principal cities of North India, [[Kolkata]] and Delhi, were connected by the railways; this being the last link of the trunk line on this route. In 1913, this was converted into a double line by adding down line girders of 12 spans of {{convert|202|ft}} each and 2 end spans of {{convert|42|ft}} to the bridge. For the movement of road traffic, two road bridges were provided below the lines. The entry of trains into [[Delhi Junction Railway station]], in such close proximity to the [[Red Fort]], never ceases to impress the rail traveler,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} reminding all that after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Uprising of 1857]], Delhi was a fortified city. The old Yamuna Bridge has an identical twin, a bridge further downstream at [[Naini]] on the [[Allahabad]] — [[Mughalsarai]] section of the now [[North Central Railway Zone (India)|North Central Railways]].

===By use===
A bridge is designed for trains, pedestrian or road traffic, a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An [[aqueduct]] is a bridge that carries water, resembling a [[viaduct]], which is a bridge that connects points of equal height.A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic.

Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undersides of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting [[suicide]], and become known as [[suicide bridge]]s.

To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a [[Moon bridge]], evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], the [[People's Republic of China]]. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.

==Structure==
Bridges may be classified by how the forces of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], [[compression (physical)|compression]], [[bending]], [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss, or not clearly discernible to a casual observer as in a box beam. Bridges can also be classified by their lineage, which is shown as the vertical axis on the diagram.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}

==Efficiency==
A bridge's ''structural efficiency'' is the ratio of load carried to bridge mass, given a specific set of material types. In one common challenge students are divided into groups and given a quantity of wood sticks, a distance to span, and glue, and then asked to construct a bridge that will be tested to destruction by the progressive addition of load at the center of the span. The bridge taking the greatest load is by this test the most ''structurally efficient''. A more refined measure for this exercise is to weigh the completed bridge rather than measure against a fixed quantity of materials provided and determine the multiple of this weight that the bridge can carry, a test that emphasizes economy of materials and efficient glue joints (see [[Balsa wood bridge|''balsa wood bridge'']]).

A bridge's ''economic efficiency'' will be site and traffic dependent, the ratio of savings by having a bridge (instead of, for example, a ferry, or a longer road route) compared to its cost. The lifetime cost is composed of materials, labor, machinery, engineering, cost of money, insurance, maintenance, refurbishment, and ultimately, demolition and associated disposal, recycling, and replacement, less the value of scrap and reuse of components. Bridges employing only compression are relatively inefficient structurally, but may be highly cost efficient where suitable materials are available near the site and the cost of labor is low. For medium spans, trusses or box beams are usually most economical, while in some cases, the appearance of the bridge may be more important than its cost efficiency. The longest spans usually require suspension bridges.

==Other functions==
* Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of [[Nový Most]] bridge in [[Bratislava]], which features a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.
* A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the [[Storstrøm Bridge]].
* Costs and [[cost overrun]]s frequently occur in bridge construction. Flyvbjerg et al. (2003) found the average cost overrun in bridge building is 34%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521009464&amp;id=RAV5P-50UjEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=megaprojects+and+Risk:+An+Anatomy+of+Ambition Flyvbjerg, Bent, Nils Bruzelius, and Werner Rothengatter, 2003. ''Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In railway parlance, an [[overbridge]] is a bridge crossing ''over'' the course of the railway. In contrast, an [[underbridge]] allows passage ''under'' the line.

==Bridge failures==
&lt;!-- [[bridge failure]] and [[bridge failures]] redirect here; be sure to update them if changing the section title --&gt;
{{see also|List of bridge failures}}

The failure of bridges is of special concern for [[structural engineers]] in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the [[Victorian era]] when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.

In the United States, the [[National Bridge Inventory]] tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designation as &quot;structurally deficient&quot; and &quot;functionally obsolete&quot;.

'''Beadwork''' is the art or craft of attaching [[bead]]s to one another or to cloth, usually by the use of a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and thread or soft, flexible wire.  Most beadwork takes the form of [[jewellery|jewelry]] or other personal adornment, but beads are also used in wall hangings and [[sculpture]].

Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into [[Bead weaving|loom]] and [[Bead weaving|off-loom]] weaving, [[Bead stringing|stringing]], [[bead embroidery]], [[bead crochet]], and [[bead knitting]].

Most [[culture]]s have employed beads for personal adornment. [[archaeology|Archaeological]] records show that people made and used beads as long as 5,000 years ago. Beads have also been used for [[religion|religious]] purposes, as good luck [[amulet|talismans]], and as curative agents.

==Modern beading==
Modern beadwork is often used as a creative [[hobby]] to create [[jewelry]], [[Handbag|purse]]s, coasters, and dozens of other crafts. Beads are available in many different designs, sizes, colors, and materials, allowing much variation among bead artisans and projects. Simple projects can be created in less than an hour by novice beaders, while complex beadwork may take weeks of meticulous work with specialized tools and equipment.

==3D beading==
[[Image:Perlentier.JPG|thumb|230px|Icebear made of seed beads]]
[[Image:Beadknitting.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Bead knitting]] on double-pointed [[knitting needle]]s]]
3D beading is less common than 2D beading, largely because free 3D beading patterns are not well distributed on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Resources are scarce and difficult to find. It is mainly an oriental art form, and most 3D beading resources are written in oriental languages, such as Japanese and Chinese, further impeding wide access to English-speaking countries. 3D beading is also associated with the stigma of being &quot;too complex&quot; for most beaders to manage, although this sentiment is largely due to the apparent complexity of many oriental beading diagrams. It is a challenge for beading pattern designers to create 2D beading patterns that portray 3D beaded objects. However, there are resources available that facilitate this process by offering free instructions on how to draw a 3D beading diagram using free software available from inkscape.org, in the hopes that clearer beading diagrams will allow easier access to 3D beading patterns.

3D beading generally uses the techniques of [[bead weaving]], which can be further divided into right angle weave and [[peyote stitch]]. Most 3D beading patterns are done in right angle weave, but sometimes both techniques are combined in the same piece. Both stitches are done using either fishing line (most popular brand: fireline) or nylon thread (most popular brand: nymo). Fishing line lends itself better to right angle weave because it is stiffer than nylon thread, so holds the beads in a tighter arrangement and does not easily break when tugged upon. On the other hand, nylon thread is more suited to peyote stitch because it is softer and more pliable than fishing line, which permits the beads of the stitch to sit straight without undue tension bending the arrangement out of place. Right angle weave is done using both ends of the fishing line, in which beads are strung in repeated circular arrangements, and the fishing line is pulled tight after each bead circle is made. Peyote stitch is stitched using only one end of the nylon thread. The other end of the string is left dangling at the beginning of the piece, while the first end of the thread progresses through the stitch. In peyote stitch, beads are woven into the piece in a very similar fashion to knitting or cross stitching. In fact, it is not uncommon for cross stitch patterns to be beaded in peyote stitch technique. Peyote stitch patterns are very easy to depict diagrammatically because they are typically stitched flat and then later incorporated into the piece or left as a flat tapestry. Right angle weave lends itself better as a technique to 3D beading, but peyote stitch offers the advantage of more tightly knit beads, which is sometimes necessary to properly portray an object in 3 dimensions.

Patterns which can be stitched using 3D beading range from animals, hearts, flowers, and jewelry, to name a few. Although scarce, there are resources available on the internet which provide 3D animal, heart and jewelry patterns in English.

==European beadwork==
Beadwork in Europe has a history dating back millennia, to when shells and animal bones were used as beads in [[necklace]]s.

Glass beads were being made in [[Murano]] by the end of the 14th century. French Beaded Flowers were being made as early as the 16th century, and [[murano beads|lampwork glass]] was invented in the 18th century. [[beads#Seed beads|Seed beads]] began to be used for embroidery, crochet, and numerous [[Bead weaving#Off-loom bead weaving|off-loom]] techniques.

==Native American beadwork==
[[File:Nat Am beadwork sampler.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Examples of contemporary Native American beadwork]]
Beadwork is a quintessentially [[Native American art]] form, but ironically uses beads imported from Europe and Asia. Glass beads have been in use for almost five centuries in the Americas. Today a wide range of beading styles flourish.

In the Great Lakes, Ursuline nuns introduced floral patterns to tribes, who quickly applied them to beadwork.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Lakes]] tribes are known for their bandolier bags, that might take an entire year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the [[Nez Perce (tribe)|Nez Perce]] perfected contour-style beadwork, in which the lines of beads are stitch to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for man and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the [[Dene]] bead lavish floral dog blankets.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Philips, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic, and [[Innu]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]], and [[Haudenosaunee]] tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the &quot;double curve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Iroquois are also known for &quot;embossed&quot; beading in which strings pulled taunt force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a [[bas-relief]]. [[Tammy Rahr]] (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.

[[File:Huichol Trabajando.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Huichol bead artist, photo by Mario Jareda Beivide]][[Huichol people|Huichol]] Indians of [[Jalisco]] and [[Nayarit]], [[Mexico]] have a completely unique approach to beadwork. They adhere beads, one by one, to a surface, such as wood or a gourd, with a mixture of resin and beeswax.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Paul. [http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/Huichol/huichol4.htm The Huichol Web of Life: Creation and Prayer.] ''The Bead Museum.'' (retrieved 13 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Native beadwork is created for tribal use but beadworkers also create conceptual work for the art world. [[Richard Aitson]] ([[Kiowa]]-[[Apache]]) has both an Indian and non-Indian audience for his work and is known for his fully beaded [[cradle board|cradleboards]]. Another Kiowa beadworker, [[Teri Greeves]] has won top honors for her beadwork, which consciously integrates both traditional and contemporary motifs, such as beaded dancers on Converse high-tops. Greeves also beads on buckskin and explores such issues as warfare or Native American voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Antonio.

[[Marcus Amerman]], [[Choctaw]], one of today's most celebrated bead artists, pioneered a movement of highly realistic  beaded portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His imagery ranges from 19th century Native leaders to pop icons including [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Brooke Shields]].

Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and [[Martha Berry (artist)|Martha Berry]], [[Cherokee]], have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of forced removal from tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie Okuma ([[Luiseño people|Luiseño]]-[[Shoshone]]-[[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]]) was won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia. The antique Venetian beads she uses can as small as size 22°, about the size of a grain of salt.&lt;ref&gt;Indyke, Dottie. [http://www.southwestart.com/article/1038 Jamie Okuma.] ''Southwest Magazine.'' 2009 (retrieved 13 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], Rhonda Holy Bear, and Charlene Holy Bear are also prominent beaded dollmakers.

The widespread popularity of glass beads does not mean aboriginal bead making is dead. Perhaps the most famous Native bead is [[wampum]], a cylindrical tube of quahog or whelk shell. Both shells produce white beads, but only parts of the quahog produce purple. These are ceremonially and politically important to a range of Eastern tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:VA23Oct10 171.jpg|thumb|350px|French earthenware tray and board game, 1720-1750]]

A '''board game''' is a [[game]] in which counters or pieces are placed, removed, or moved on a premarked surface or &quot;'''board'''&quot; according to a set of rules. Games may be based on pure [[strategy]], chance or a mixture of the two and usually have a goal which a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies and most current board games are still based on beating opposing players in terms of counters, winning position or accrual of points (often expressed as in-game currency).

There are many different types and styles of board games. Their representation of a real life situation can range from having no inherent theme, such as ''[[Checkers]]'', to having a specific theme and narrative, such as [[Cluedo]]. Rules range from the very simple, such as in [[Tic-tac-toe]], to ones which describe a game universe in great detail, such as in [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], although most of these are [[Role-playing game]]s and the board is secondary to the game, serving to visualize the [[scenario]]. The length of time it takes to learn to play or master a game can vary greatly from game to game. Learning time does not necessarily correlate with the amount or complexity of rules; some games, such as [[chess]], [[Go (board game)|Go]] have simple rules that can still lead to complex scenarios.

==History==
[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer der Nefertari 003.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Senet]]'' is among the oldest known board games.]]

[[Image:Jiroft scorpion.png|thumb|150px|Another game board found in the [[Jiroft civilization]].]]

Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history; some even pre-date literacy skill development in the earliest civilizations. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A number of important historical sites, artifacts and documents exist which shed light on early board games. Some of these include:
*The [[Jiroft civilization]] game boards
*''[[Senet]]'' has been found in [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] and [[First dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] burials of [[Egypt]], c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;senet1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Piccione/index.html |title=In Search of the Meaning of Senet |first=Peter A. |last=Piccione |journal=Archaeology |year=1980 |month=July/August |pages=55–58 |accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Senet'' is the oldest board game known to have existed, and was pictured in a [[fresco]] found in Merknera's tomb ([[33rd century BC|3300]]-[[27th century BC|2700 BC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;senet2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrejsi.cz/clanky/dama1.html |title='&amp;#39;Okno do svita deskovych her'&amp;#39; |publisher=Hrejsi.cz |date=1998-04-27 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mehen (game)|Mehen]]'' is another ancient board game from [[Predynastic Egypt]].
*''[[Go (board game)|Go]]'' is an ancient strategic board game originating in [[China]]
*''[[Patolli]]'' is a board game originating in [[Mesoamerica]], and was played by the ancient [[Aztec]].
*The [[Ur|Royal Tombs of Ur]] contained, among others, the [[Royal Game of Ur]]. They were excavated by [[Leonard Woolley]], but his books document little on the games found. Most of the games he excavated are now housed in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].
*The [[Buddha games list]] is the earliest known list of games.

Many board games are now available as [[computer games]], which can include the computer itself as one of several players, or as sole opponent. The rise of computer use is one of the reasons said to have led to a relative decline in board games.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Many board games can now be played [[Internet|online]] against a computer and/or other players. Some [[website]]s allow play in [[real time (media)|real time]] and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use [[email]] to notify the players after each move (see the links at the end of this article). {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Modern technology (the [[internet]] and cheaper home [[printing]]) has also influenced board games via the phenomenon of print-and-play board games that you buy and print yourself.

Some board games make use of components in addition to—or instead of—a board and playing pieces. Some games use [[CD]]s, [[video cassette]]s, and, more recently, [[DVD]]s in accompaniment to the game.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Psychology==
While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., [[chess]], ''[[Go (board game)|Go]]'', ''[[mancala]]''), less has been done on contemporary board games such as ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Scrabble]]'', and ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Gobet, Fernand, de Voogt, Alex, &amp; Retschitzki, Jean  | title= Moves in mind: The psychology of board games | publisher= Psychology Press | year=2004 | isbn=1841693367}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible precisely to compare their levels of expertise. The works of [[Adriaan de Groot]], William Chase, and [[Herbert Simon]] have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing. This seems to be the case in other traditional games such as ''Go'' and ''Oware'' (a type of ''mancala'' game), but data is lacking in regard to contemporary board games. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny|Bruce Halpenny]], a [[games inventor]] said when interviewed about his game, “With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player’s imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble they take in the early stage of the game there is a build up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society, because most jobs are boring and repetitive.”&lt;ref name=TRN1976 &gt;Stealing the show.  ''Toy Retailing News'' - Volume 2 Number 4 - December 1976 - page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luck, strategy and diplomacy==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
An important dimension describing the variation in board games is the level of randomness/[[luck]] involved in game play, as opposed to the influence of player [[strategy]]. Some games, such as [[chess]], depend almost entirely on player skill. Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with games such as ''[[Candy Land]]'' and ''[[Snakes and ladders]]'' having no decisions to be made. Most board games involve both luck and strategy. A player may be hampered by a few poor rolls of the [[dice]] in ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' or ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', but over many games a player with a superior strategy will win more often. While some purists consider luck to not be a desirable component of a game, others counter that elements of luck can make for far more diverse and multi-faceted strategies as concepts such as [[expected value]] and [[risk management]] must be considered.

A second dimension regards the game information available to players. Some games (chess being the classical example) are so-called [[perfect information]] games, where every player has access to complete information regarding the game state. Other games, such as [[Tigris and Euphrates]] keep parts of the game state hidden from players. This makes searching for optimal moves more difficult, but also requires estimation of certain probabilities by the players. [[Tigris and Euphrates]] is also an example of a game that with significant hidden information but at the same time completely deterministic action resolution. 

The third important dimension is the amount and importance of [[diplomacy]], i.e. players making deals with each other. A game of [[solitaire]], for obvious reasons, has no player interaction. Two player games usually do not have diplomacy ([[cooperative games]] being the exception). Thus, this generally applies only to games played with three or more people. An important facet of ''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'', for example, is convincing people to trade with you rather than with other players. In ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'', one example of diplomacy's effectiveness is when two or more players team up against others. Easy diplomacy consists of convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. Difficult diplomacy (such as in the aptly named game ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'') consists of making elaborate plans together, with possibility of betrayal.

Luck is introduced to a game by a number of methods. The most popular is using [[dice]], generally six-sided. These can determine everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in ''[[Monopoly]]'', to how their forces fare in battle, such as in ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'', or which resources a player gains, such as in ''The Settlers of Catan''. Other games such as ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'' use a deck of special [[Playing card|card]]s that, when shuffled, create randomness. ''[[Scrabble]]'' does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a person gets. [[German-style board game]]s are notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many North American board games.

==Common terms==
[[File:Spielstein .jpg|thumb|Simple wooden &quot;pawn-style&quot; playing pieces]]
[[Image:Carcassonne Miples.jpg|thumb|Wooden tokens from the [[Carcassonne (game)|Carcassonne]] board game.]]
Although many board games have a [[jargon]] all their own, there is a generalized [[terminology]] to describe concepts applicable to basic [[game mechanic]]s and attributes common to nearly all board games.
*'''Game board''' (or simply '''board''')&amp;mdash;the (usually [[quadrilateral]]) surface on which one plays a board game; the [[namesake]] of the board game, gameboards would seem to be a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] of the [[genre]], though card games that do not use a standard deck of cards (as well as games which use neither cards nor a game board) are often colloquially included. Most games use a standardized and unchanging board ([[chess]], [[go (board game)|Go]], and [[backgammon]] all have such a board), but many games use a ''modular'' board whose component tiles or cards can assume varying layouts from one session to another, or even as the game is played.
*'''Game piece''' (or '''counter''' or '''token''' or '''bit''' or '''meeple''' or '''mover''' or '''pawn''')&amp;mdash;a player's representative on the game board. Each player may control one or more game pieces. In some games that involve commanding multiple game pieces, such as chess, certain pieces have unique designations and capabilities within the [[parameter]]s of the game; in others, such as Go, all pieces controlled by a player have the same essential capabilities. In some modern board games, such as [[Cluedo|Clue]], there are other pieces that are not a player's representative, i.e. weapons. In some games, pieces may not represent or belong to a particular player.
*'''Jump'''&amp;mdash;to bypass one or more game pieces or '''spaces'''. Depending on the context, '''jumping''' may also involve capturing or conquering an opponent's game piece. (''See also:'' [[Game mechanic#Capture|Game mechanic: capture]])
*'''Space''' (or '''square''')&amp;mdash;a [[units of measurement|physical unit]] of progress on a gameboard delimited by a distinct [[Border#Generic border|border]]. Alternatively, a unique, atomic position on the board on which a game piece may be located while in play (in Go, for example, the pieces are placed on intersections of lines on the grid, not in the areas bounded by the grid lines as is seen in chess). (''See also:'' [[Game mechanic#Movement|Game mechanic: Movement]])
*'''Hex'''&amp;mdash;in hexagon-based board games, this is the common term for a standard space on the board. This is most often used in [[wargaming]], though some [[abstract strategy games]] such as [[Abalone (board game)|Abalone]] use hexagonal layouts.
*'''Card'''&amp;mdash;a piece of cardboard on which instructions are given
*'''Deck'''&amp;mdash;a stack of cards
*'''Capture'''&amp;mdash;a method in which one removes another players game piece from the board, for example: in checkers if you [[Game mechanic#Jump|jump]] another player's piece, that piece is captured.

[[Image:Beads.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Beads]]

A '''bead''' is a small, decorative object that is usually pierced for [[yarn|threading]] or stringing. Beads range in size from under {{convert|1|mm|in}} to over {{convert|1|cm|in}} in diameter. A pair of beads made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' sea snail shells, approximately 100,000 years old, are thought to be the earliest known examples of [[jewellery]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1670011.htm Shell beads suggest new roots for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0703877104v1 82,000-year-old shell beads from North Africa and implications for the origins of modern human behavior]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beadwork]] is the art or craft of making things with beads. Beads can be woven together with specialized [[yarn|thread]], strung onto thread or soft, flexible [[wire]], or adhered to a surface (e.g. [[Cloth|fabric]], [[clay]]).

== Types of beads ==
[[Image:Cloisonnebeads.jpg|thumb|right|Cloisonné beads]]

Beads may be divided into several types of overlapping categories, based on different criteria such as component materials, manufacturing process, place or period of origin, surface patterning, or general shape. In some cases, such as [[millefiori]] and [[cloisonné]] beads, multiple categories may overlap in an inseparably interdependent fashion.

== Components ==
Beads can be made of many types of materials. The earliest beads were made of convenient natural materials; when found, these could be readily drilled and shaped. As human technology became capable of obtaining or working with more difficult natural materials, those were added to the range of available substances. The same was true of new synthetic materials when created.

In modern manufacturing, the most common bead materials are wood, [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[metal]], and [[Rock (geology)|stone]].

=== Natural materials ===
Beads are still made from many naturally-occurring materials, both organic (i.e., of [[animal]]- or [[plant]]-based origin) and inorganic (purely [[mineral]] origin). However, some of these materials now routinely undergo some extra human processing beyond mere shaping and drilling, such as color enhancement via [[dyes]] or irradiation. Beads can also be made from chocolate. These types of beads are edible, and commonly found in Indonesia and central Mexico. 

The natural organics include [[bone]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[ivory]], [[seed]]s (such as [[tagua]] nuts), [[animal shell]], and [[wood]]. For most of human history, [[pearl]]s were the ultimate precious beads of natural origin because of their rarity, although the [[cultured pearl|pearl-culturing process]] has now made them far more common. [[Amber]] and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] are also of natural organic origin, although both materials have undergone partial geologic [[fossil]]ization.

The natural inorganics include various types of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s (from [[gemstone]]s to common [[mineral]]s) and [[metal]]s. Of the latter, only a few [[precious metal]]s occur in pure forms, but other purified [[base metal]]s may as well be placed in this category along with certain naturally-occurring alloys such as [[electrum]].

=== Synthetic materials ===
[[Image:Crystbeads.jpg|thumb|right|[[Swarovski]] crystal beads ({{nowrap|6 mm&amp;ndash;8 mm}}), pendant 3 cm]]
[[Image:Hama beads.jpg|thumb|right|Fusible beads]]
The oldest-surviving synthetic materials used for beadmaking have generally been [[ceramic]]s: [[pottery]] and [[glass]]. Beads were also made from the ancient alloys such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]], but as those were more vulnerable to [[oxidation]], those have generally been less well-preserved at archaeological sites.

Many different subtypes of [[glass]] are now used for beadmaking, some of which have their own component-specific names. [[Lead crystal]] beads have a high percentage of [[lead oxide]] in the glass formula, increasing the [[refractive index]]. Most of the other named glass types have their formulations and patterns inseparable from the manufacturing process.

Plastic fusible beads are also known as Perler Beads, or called &quot;melty beads&quot; by young children. These small colorful beads can be placed on a solid plastic-backed peg array to form designs and then melted together with a [[Ironing|clothes iron]]; alternatively, they can be strung into necklaces or bracelets, or woven into keychains. Fusible beads come in many colors and degrees of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]]/[[opacity (optics)|opacity]], including varieties that glow in the dark or have internal [[glitter]]; peg boards come in various shapes and several geometric patterns.

== Manufacturing ==
Modern mass-produced beads are generally shaped by [[carving]] or [[casting]], depending on the material and desired effect. In some cases, more specialized [[metalworking]] or [[glass]]working techniques may be employed, or a combination of multiple techniques and materials such as [[cloisonné]].

=== Glassworking ===
[[Image:Pressedglass.jpg|thumb|right|Pressed glass beads (matte finish with an AB coating)]]
[[Image:Firebead.jpg|thumb|left|Fire polished beads ({{convert|10|mm}}) with AB coating]]
Most glass beads are [[pressed glass]], mass-produced by preparing a molten batch of [[Glass coloring and color marking|glass of the desired color]] and pouring it into molds to form the desired shape. This is also true of most [[plastic]] beads.

A smaller and more expensive subset of glass and lead crystal beads are cut into precise faceted shapes on an individual basis. This was once done by hand, but has largely been taken over by precision machinery.

&quot;Fire-polished&quot; faceted beads are a less expensive alternative to hand-cut faceted glass or crystal. They derive their name from the second half of a two-part process: first, the glass batch is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, &quot;polishing&quot; out any minor surface irregularities from the mold.

==== Specialized glass techniques/types ====
[[Image:Dichroicclose.jpg|thumb|right|Dichroic beads ({{convert|10|mm}})]]
[[Image:Furnaceglass.jpg|thumb|right|Furnace glass beads]]
There are several specialized glassworking techniques that create a distinctive appearance throughout the body of the resulting beads, which are then primarily referred to by the glass type.

If the glass batch is used to create a large massive block instead of pre-shaping it as it cools, the result may then be carved into smaller items in the same manner as stone. Conversely, glass artisans may make beads by [[lampworking]] the glass on an individual basis; once formed, the beads undergo little or no further shaping after the layers have been properly [[annealing (glass)|anneal]]ed.

Most of these glass subtypes are some form of [[fused glass]], although [[Goldstone (gemstone)|goldstone]] is created by controlling the reductive atmosphere of the glass batch rather than by fusing separate components together.

[[Dichroic glass]] beads incorporate a semitransparent microlayer of metal between two or more layers. [[Fibre optic]] glass beads have an eyecatching [[chatoyant]] effect across the grain.

There are also several ways to fuse many small glass canes together into a multicolored pattern, resulting in [[millefiori]] beads or [[chevron bead]]s (sometimes called &quot;trade beads&quot;). &quot;Furnace glass&quot; beads encase a multicolored core in a transparent exterior layer which is then annealed in a furnace.

More economically, millefiori beads can also be made by limiting the patterning process to long, narrow canes or rods known as murrine. Thin cross-sections, or &quot;decals&quot;, can then be cut from the murrine and fused into the surface of a plain glass bead.

== Shapes ==
* [[Bugle bead]]s

===Hair pipe beads===
Elk rib bones were the original material for the long, tubular [[hair pipe]] beads.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 43, 44&lt;/ref&gt; Today these beads are commonly made of [[bison]] and [[water buffalo]] bones and are that popular for breastplates and chokers among [[Plains Indians]]. Black variations of these beads are made from the animals' horns.

===Seed beads===
{{Main|Seed bead}}
Seed beads are uniformly shaped spheroidal or tube shaped beads ranging in size from under a millimetre to several millimetres. &quot;Seed Bead&quot; is a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for [[Bead weaving|loom]] and [[Bead weaving|off-loom]] bead weaving.

== Place or period of origin ==
[[Image:Cinnabarbead.jpg|thumb|right|Carved [[Cinnabar]] [[lacquer]] beads]]
'''African trade beads''' or '''[[slave beads]]''' may be antique beads that were manufactured in Europe and used for trade during the colonial period, such as chevron beads; or they may have been made in West Africa by and for Africans, such as Mauritanian [[Kiffa beads]], Ghanaian and Nigerian [[powder glass beads]], or African-made brass beads.

'''Austrian crystal''' is a generic term for cut lead-crystal beads, based on the location and prestige of the [[Swarovski]] firm.

'''Czech glass''' beads are made in the [[Czech Republic]], centralized around an area called [[Jablonec nad Nisou]]. Production of glass beads in the area dates back to the 14th century, though production was depressed under communist rule. Because of this long tradition, their workmanship and quality has an excellent reputation.

'''Vintage beads''', in the collectibles and antique market, refers to an items that are at 25 or more years old. Vintage beads are available in materials that include lucite, plastic, crystal, metal and glass.

=== Miscellaneous ethnic beads ===
[[Tibet]]an [[Dzi bead]]s and [[Rudraksha bead]]s are customary for making Buddhist and Hindu rosaries ([[Prayer beads|malas]]). [[Magatama]] are traditional [[Japan]]ese beads, and [[cinnabar]] was often used for beads in [[China]]. [[Wampum]] are cylindrical white or purple beads made from [[quahog]] or North Atlantic [[channeled whelk]] shells by northeastern Native American tribes, such as the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] and [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Job's tears]] are a popular seed bead among Southeastern Native American tribes.

== Surface patterns ==
After shaping, glass and crystal beads can have their surface appearance enhanced by etching a translucent frosted layer, applying an additional color layer, or both. ''Aurora Borealis'', or AB, is a surface coating that diffuses light into a rainbow. Other surface coatings are vitrail, moonlight, dorado, satin, star shine, heliotrope.

Faux beads are beads that are made to look like a more expensive original material, especially in the case of fake [[pearl]]s and simulated rocks, [[minerals]] and [[gemstone]]s. Precious metals and [[ivory]] are also imitated.

[[Tagua nut]]s from South America are used as an ivory substitute since the natural [[ivory trade]] has been restricted worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bead weaving''' using [[seed beads]] can be done either on a [[loom]] or using one of a number of off-loom stitches.

==On-loom beadweaving==
[[image:Apachebeadloom1903.png|thumb|355px|An old bead loom. 1. Roller. 2. Roller end. 3. Spacers. 4. Spacers.]]

When weaving on a loom, the beads are locked in between the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads by the [[weft]] threads.  The most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread.  First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft [[yarn|thread]].  Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads.  The [[Sewing needle|needle]] is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular near the beginning of the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.

Although loomed pieces are typically rectangular, it is possible to increase and decrease to produce angular or curvy shapes.  [[Fringe (trim)|Fringe]] can also be added during weaving or before the piece is removed from the loom.

Bead looms vary in size and are typically made of wood or metal.  Usually, a [[comb]] or [[Spring (device)|spring]] is used to hold the warp threads a bead-width apart.  Some looms have roller bars that allow the weaver to produce pieces that are longer than the loom.  Most looms are meant to sit on a table, but some have floor stands or are meant to sit in the [[lap]].

==Off-loom beadweaving==

Off-loom beadweaving is a family of [[beadwork]] techniques in which seed [[bead]]s are woven together into a flat [[Cloth|fabric]] or a three-dimensional object such as a ball, clasp, box, or a piece of jewelry. All off-loom techniques can be accomplished using a single needle and thread (no warp threads), but some have two-needle variations.

Different stitches produce pieces with distinct textures, shapes, and patterns.  There are a number of different off-loom bead stitches, including:
* [[peyote stitch]], also known as gourd stitch
* [[brick stitch]], also known as Comanche or Cheyenne stitch
* [[square stitch]]
* [[herringbone stitch]], also known as Ndebele stitch
* [[Pondo stitch]], also known as African circle stitch
* [[right-angle weave]]
* [[triangle weave]]
* [[bead netting]]
* [[African helix]]
* [[Dutch spiral]]

'''Branchiopoda''' is a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[crustacean]]s. It is the [[sister group]] to the remaining crustaceans, and comprises [[Anostraca|fairy shrimp]], [[clam shrimp]], [[Cladocera]] and [[Notostraca]]. They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus, with the exception of the Cladocera, many of which are marine.

==Description==
Members of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of [[gill]]s on many of the animal's [[appendage]]s, including some of the [[arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]]. This is also responsible for the name of the group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The animal kingdom: arranged after its organization, forming a natural history of animals, and an introduction to comparative anatomy |author=[[Georges Cuvier]] (trans.

Branchiopoda |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1961 |edition=4th |author=[[Libbie Hyman]] |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7FM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA373}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the groups where the carapace prevents the use of the trunk limbs for swimming (Cladocera, clam shrimp and the extinct [[Lipostraca]]), the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are used for locomotion, as they are in the [[nauplius (larva)|nauplius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman&quot;/&gt; Male fairy shrimp have an enlarged pair of antennae with which they grasp the female during mating, while the [[bottom feeder|bottom-feeding]] Notostraca, the antennae are reduced to [[Vestigiality|vestiges]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman&quot;/&gt; The trunk limbs are beaten in a [[metachronal rhythm]], causing a flow of water along the midline of the animal, from which it derives [[oxygen]], [[food]] and, in the case of the Anostraca and Notostraca, movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==
Among the branchiopods, only some [[cladocera]]ns are marine; all the other groups are found in continental waters [[freshwater|fresh water]], including [[vernal pool|temporary pools]] and salt lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sol Felty Light |title=Intertidal invertebrates of the central California coast |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1970 |isbn=9780520007505 |chapter=Phylum Arthropoda |pages=112–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most branchiopodans eat floating [[detritus]] or [[plankton]], which they take using the [[seta]]e on their appendages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman&quot;/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
In early taxonomic treatments, the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus, ''Monoculus''. The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by [[Pierre André Latreille]] in 1817, initially at the [[taxonomic rank|rank]] of [[Order (biology)|order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=The animal kingdom arranged in conformity with its organization |volume=3 |title=The Crustacea, Arachnides and Insecta |author=[[Pierre André Latreille]] |editor=[[Georges Cuvier]] |translated=Henry M'Murtrie |publisher=G. &amp; C. &amp; H.

{{main|Clam shrimp}}
Clam shrimp are bivalved animals which have lived since at least the [[Devonian]]. The three groups are not believed to form a [[clade]]. They have 10–32 trunk segments, decreasing in size from front to back, and each bears a pair of [[arthropod leg|legs]] which also carry [[gill]]s. A strong muscle can close the two halves of the shell together.

'''Baruch de Spinoza''' ({{lang-he|ברוך שפינוזה}} ''Baruch Spinoza'', {{lang-pt|Bento de Espinosa}}, {{lang-la|Benedictus de Spinoza}}) and later '''Benedict de Spinoza''' (November 24, 1632 – February 21, 1677) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Revealing considerable scientific aptitude, the breadth and importance of Spinoza's work was not fully realized until years after his death. Today, he is considered one of the great [[rationalism|rationalists]]&lt;ref name=tws9909/&gt; of the [[17th-century philosophy]], laying the groundwork for the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]&lt;ref name=tws9909/&gt; and modern [[biblical criticism]].&lt;ref name=tws9909/&gt; By virtue of his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], the posthumous ''[[Ethics (book)|Ethics]]'', in which he opposed [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' mind–body dualism, Spinoza is considered to be one of [[Western philosophy|Western philosophy's]] most important philosophers. Philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] said of all contemporary philosophers, &quot;You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hegel's History of Philosophy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ESNZ3TUdN40C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=%22you+are+either+a+spinozist+or+not+a+philosopher+at+all%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XRsqJEbyNT&amp;sig=bCClaJ9V6lL_CJbOR-S3zaGwHqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result |title=Hegel's History of Philosophy |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza was raised in the Dutch Jewish community. In time he developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. The Jewish religious authorities issued a ''[[cherem]]'' (Hebrew: חרם, a kind of [[excommunication]]) against him, effectively dismissing him from Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Index of [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|banned books]].

Spinoza lived quietly as a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] grinder, turning down rewards and honors throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions, and gave his family inheritance to his sister. Spinoza's philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted 20th century philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] to name him &quot;the 'prince' of philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the translator's preface of Deleuze ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza died at the age of 44 allegedly of a lung illness, perhaps [[tuberculosis]] or [[silicosis]] exacerbated by fine [[glass]] dust inhaled while plying his trade. Spinoza is buried in the churchyard of the Christian [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Biography==
===Family origins===
Spinoza's ancestors were of [[Sephardic Jew]]ish descent, and were a part of the community of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jews]] that grew in the city of [[Amsterdam]] after the [[Alhambra Decree]] in Spain (1492) and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536) had led to [[Conversos|forced conversions]] and expulsions from the [[Iberian peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, M (ed.), '''''Spinoza, Baruch''''', Chambers Biographical Dictionary, Chambers 1990, ISBN 0-550-16041-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians argue the Spinoza family (&quot;Espinosa&quot; in Portuguese) had its origins in [[Espinosa de los Monteros]], near [[Burgos]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Javier Muguerza in his ''Desde la perplejidad''&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim they were Portuguese Jews who had moved to Spain and then were expelled back to their home country in 1492, only to be forcibly converted to Catholicism in 1498{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Spinoza's father was born roughly a century after this forced conversion in the small Portuguese city of [[Vidigueira]], near [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] in [[Alentejo]]. When Spinoza's father was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza (who was from [[Lisbon]]), took his family to [[Nantes]] in [[France]]. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to [[Rotterdam]], where Isaac died in 1627. Spinoza's father, Miguel, and his uncle, Manuel, then moved to Amsterdam where they reassumed their Judaism.  Manuel changed his name to ''Abraão de Spinoza'', though his &quot;commercial&quot; name was still the same.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Early life and career===
Baruch de Spinoza was born in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. His mother Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old. Miguel was a successful importer/merchant and Baruch had a traditional Jewish upbringing.

Spinoza attended the Keter Torah yeshiva headed by Rabbi Shaul Levi Morteira, and maintained a connection with Rabbi Menasseh ben Israel, whose home was a center for Jewish scholars in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hegel's History of Philosophy&quot;/&gt; In time, however, his critical, curious nature would come into conflict with the Jewish community.

Wars with England and France{{Vague|Which war?|date=July 2010}} took the life of his father and decimated his family's fortune but he was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his brother, Gabriel, and devote himself to philosophy and optics.

===Controversial ideas and Jewish reaction===
[[File:Espinoza estatua.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Statue of Spinoza, near his house on the Paviljoensgracht in [[The Hague]].]]

It is largely believed that on 27 July 1656, the Jewish community issued to him the writ of ''[[cherem]]'' (Hebrew: חרם, a kind of [[excommunication]]). 

While the language of the cherem is unusually harsh, the exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated.&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Smith, ''Spinoza's book of life: freedom and redemption in the Ethics'', Yale University Press (December 1, 2003), p.xx/Introduction [http://books.google.com/books?id=j0dMphwIwQ8C&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=cherem+-+spinoza+-+unknown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OPBy3G58Jj&amp;sig=B4K5gEHFfPBwKtnK0kPxfqeE2mY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LlJITLe9FMT7lweKpMWbCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cherem%20-%20spinoza%20-%20unknown&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to philosopher Steven Nadler an educated guess is quite straightforward: &quot;No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri Jun 29, 2001; substantive revision Mon December 1, 2008, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato.standord.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's cherem was effected by way of public denunciation; the following document translates the official record of that denunciation:&lt;ref name=&quot;ts66&quot;&gt;Steven Nadler, Spinoza: A Life, Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (April 23, 2001), ISBN 0-521-00293-1, Page: 120&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Lords of the ma’amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch
de Spinoza, have endeavord by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil
ways.  But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary,
daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies
which he practiced and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this
numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and born witness to this effect in
the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter;
and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honorable chachamin,
they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be
excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel.  By the decree of the angels,
and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn
Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of
all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the six-hundred-andthirteen precepts which are written therein, with the excommunication with which
Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys, and with all
the curses which are written in the Book of the Law.  Cursed be he by day and cursed
be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up;
cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in.  The Lord will not
spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon
him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name
from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of
Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But
you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should
communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favor, or stay with him
under the same roof, or within four ells of him, or read anything composed or written
by him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some argue that, in view of Christian opposition to Spinoza's opinions, the Jewish community had little option but to dissociate itself from Spinoza's &quot;heresies&quot;. Historian Adri Offenberg argues that the Amsterdam Jewish Community, at the time in its infancy and struggling to secure its position in the Dutch republic, was placed under aggressive external pressure by the Dutch Reformed and Roman Catholic Churches to unwillingly quell what was perceived as heresy in dominant Christian circles (Die Lebensgeschichte Spinozas). {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

After his ''cherem'', it is reported that Spinoza lived and worked in the school of [[Franciscus van den Enden]], who taught him Latin in his youth and may have introduced him to [[modern philosophy]], although Spinoza never mentions Van den Enden anywhere in his books or letters. Van den Enden was a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] and [[atheist]] {{fact|date=May 2011}} who was forbidden by the city government to propagate his doctrines publicly {{fact|date=May 2011}}. His books were put on the Catholic Index of banned books.

Philosopher Richard Popkin questions the historical veracity of the ''cherem'', which Popkin claims emerged close to 300 years after Spinoza's death.&lt;ref name=tws9990/&gt;

During the 1650s, Spinoza Christianized his name to become &quot;Benedict&quot; (which, like Baruch, means &quot;blessed&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strathern, Paul|title=Spinoza in 90 Minutes|pages=24–25|year=1998|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|isbn=1-56663-215-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph (below) is much too heavy with superscript and markup... needs another paragraph, at the very least... --&gt;
During this period Spinoza also became acquainted with several [[Collegiants]], members of an eclectic [[sect]] with tendencies towards [[rationalism]]. Many of his friends belonged to dissident Christian groups which met regularly as discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority of established churches as well as traditional dogmas.&lt;ref name=tws908&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as mentioned above), and his own work bears some striking resemblances to specific important parts of Spinoza's philosophy (see: [[Monadology]]).

When the public reactions to the anonymously published ''Theologico-Political Treatise'' were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a [[signet ring]] engraved with his initials, a rose,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and the word &quot;caute&quot; (Latin for &quot;cautiously&quot;). The ''Ethics'' and all other works, apart from the ''Descartes' Principles of Philosophy'' and the ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', were published after his death, in the ''[[Opera Posthuma]]'' edited by his friends in secrecy to avoid confiscation and destruction of manuscripts. The ''Ethics'' contains many still-unresolved obscurities and is written with a forbidding mathematical structure modeled on Euclid's geometry &lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; and has been described as a &quot;superbly cryptic masterwork.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

===Later life and career===
[[Image:Casa espinoza.jpg|right|thumb|Spinoza's house in [[Rijnsburg]] from 1661-3, now a museum]]
[[Image:Estudio espinoza.jpg|right|thumb|Study room of Spinoza]]
Spinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; He preached a philosophy of tolerance and benevolence. [[Anthony Gottlieb]] described him as living &quot;a saintly life.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;

Spinoza relocated from Amsterdam to [[Rijnsburg]] (near [[Leiden]]) around 1661 and later lived in [[Voorburg]] and [[The Hague]] respectively. He earned a comfortable living from lens-grinding. While the lens-grinding aspect of Spinoza's work is uncontested, the type of lenses he made is in question. Many have said he produced excellent magnifying glasses, and some historians credit him with being an [[optician]] (in the sense of making lenses for eyeglasses). He was also supported by small, but regular, donations from close friends.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;

He died in 1677 while still working on a political thesis. His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly the result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses he ground. Or also possibly due to a syndrome, known as [[Familial Mediterranean Fever]] (FMF) which is a hereditary inflammatory disorder that affects groups of people originating from around the Mediterranean Sea. Both explanations are however doubtful, since there are no reports of a special affliction amongst glass grinders and FMF is a benign disorder.

Only a year earlier, Spinoza had met with Leibniz at [[The Hague]] for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, ''[[Ethics (book)|Ethics]]'', which had been completed in 1676. Leibniz then began to plagiarize the as-yet unpublished work when he returned to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strathern, Paul|title=Spinoza in 90 Minutes|page=53|year=1998|publisher=Ivan R.

When he died, he was considered a saint by the general Christian population, and was buried in holy ground.

===Dutch Port cities as sites of free thought===
Amsterdam and Rotterdam were important [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] centers where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. It was this hustle and bustle which ensured, as in the Mediterranean region during the Renaissance, some possibility of free thought and shelter from the crushing hand of ecclesiastical authority. Thus, Spinoza no doubt had access to a circle of friends who were basically heretics in the eyes of tradition. One of the people he must have known was [[Niels Stensen]], a brilliant Danish student in Leiden; others were [[Coenraad van Beuningen]] and his cousin [[Albert Burgh]], with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

===Substance, attributes and modes===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
{{cquote2
|These are the fundamental concepts with which Spinoza sets forth a vision of Being, illuminated by his awareness of God. They may seem strange at first sight. To the question &quot;What is?&quot; he replies: &quot;Substance, its attributes, and modes&quot;.
|[[Karl Jaspers]]&lt;ref&gt;''Spinoza'', Karl Jaspers p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Spinoza believed God exists only philosophically and that God was abstract and impersonal.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against &quot;received authority.&quot; As a youth he first subscribed to [[René Descartes|Descartes's]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] belief that body and mind are two separate substances, but later changed his view and asserted that they were not separate, being a single identity. He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part.  Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; namely the single [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning &quot;that which stands beneath&quot; rather than &quot;matter&quot;) that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser &quot;entities&quot; are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics.''&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; That humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, is a result of their awareness of appetites while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do. Spinoza has been described by one writer as an &quot;Epicurean materialist.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

Spinoza contends that &quot;''[[Deus]] sive Natura''&quot; (&quot;God or Nature&quot;) is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as one and the same. The universal substance consists of both body and mind, there being no difference between these aspects.  This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind-body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by providence, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Thus, according to this understanding of Spinoza's system, God would be the natural world and have no personality.

In addition to substance, the other two fundamental concepts Spinoza presents and develops in the ''Ethics'' are attribute – that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance, and mode – the modifications of substance, or that which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than itself.

Spinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do. So freedom is not the possibility to say &quot;no&quot; to what happens to us but the possibility to say &quot;yes&quot; and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that way. By forming more &quot;adequate&quot; ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II.  However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does. Therefore, humans have no free will. They believe, however, that their will is free. In his letter to G. H. Schaller (Letter 62), he wrote: &quot;men are conscious of their own desire, but are ignorant of the causes whereby that desire has been determined.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: &quot;[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfill a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain [[happiness]] (or [[eudaimonia]], for the Stoics). However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Scruton, ''Spinoza, A very Short Introduction'', p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Spinoza's philosophical positions are:
* The natural world is infinite.
* Good and evil are related to human pleasure and pain.
* Everything done by humans and other animals is excellent and divine.
* All rights are derived from the State.
* Animals can be used in any way by people for the benefit of the human race, according to a rational consideration of the benefit as well as the animal's status in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: &quot;Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, ''that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please'', treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours....&quot; (Emphasis added to quotation.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] criticized Spinoza's attitude toward animals: &quot;His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights,...in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.&quot; ''The World as Will and Representation'', tr.E.F.J. Payne (1958) Dover. New York 1966 Vol. 2, Chapter 50, p.645. = ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'' (hrsg.Arthur Hübscher), Reclam Stuttgart, 1987 Band 2, p.837&lt;/ref&gt;
* Might is right.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', 4, 37, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/845359/BENEDICT-DE-SPINOZAS-POLITICAL-TREATISE-1677 ''Tractatus Politicus''], ch. 2, section 8. &quot;each has as much right as he has power&quot; [unusquisque tantum juris habet, quantum potentia valet].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical philosophy===
Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particular individual.  Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans.  Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which &quot;All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection.&quot;  Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[contingency|contingent]].

===Spinoza's ''Ethics''===
{{Main|Ethics (book)}}
In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God/Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful for rhetoric, is inadequate for discovering universal truth; Spinoza's mathematical and logical approach to [[metaphysics]], and therefore ethics, concluded that emotion is formed from inadequate understanding.  His concept of &quot;[[conatus]]&quot; states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being and an assertion that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.

In the final part of the &quot;[[Ethics (book)|Ethics]]&quot;, his concern with the meaning of &quot;true blessedness&quot;, and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause and so master them, give some prediction of psychological techniques developed in the 1900s.  His concept of three types of knowledge – opinion, reason, intuition – and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.  His unique contribution to understanding the workings of mind is extraordinary, even during this time of radical philosophical developments, in that his views provide a bridge between religions' mystical past and psychology of the present day.

Given Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where &quot;necessity&quot; reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning. Human catastrophes, social injustices, etc., are merely apparent. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.

However, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] contended that Spinoza's book is the opposite of ethics. &quot;&amp;hellip;[I]t is precisely ''ethics'' on which all ''pantheism'' is wrecked. If the world is a theophany, then everything that man does, and indeed every animal does, is equally divine; nothing can be censurable and nothing can be more praiseworthy than anything else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, &quot;Pandectae II,&quot; § 91&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, Spinoza's &quot;teaching amounts to saying; 'The world is because it is; and it is as it is because it is so.'&amp;hellip;Yet the deification of the world&amp;hellip;did not admit of any true ethics; moreover, it was in flagrant contradiction with the physical evils and moral wickedness of this world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', volume 1, &quot;Fragments for the History of Philosophy,&quot; § 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of reception==
===Panentheist, pantheist, or atheist?===
{{Main|Spinozism}}
*On this same topic as it relates to Spinoza's philosophy, see also [[Pantheism controversy]].

It is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated [[God]] with the material universe. However, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states that: &quot;as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (March 26, 2009), ISBN 1-60459-156-0, letter 73&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.  According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote &quot;''Deus sive Natura''&quot; (God or Nature) Spinoza meant God was ''[[Natura naturans]]'' not ''[[Natura naturata]]'', and Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]], signified God's ''immanence''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ts64&quot;&gt;Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (October 23, 1974), ISBN 0-15-684730-2, Pages: 14 and 95&lt;/ref&gt; Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course &quot;divisible&quot;; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that &quot;no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided&quot; (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that &quot;a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible&quot; (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).&lt;ref name=&quot;ts65&quot;&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (October 2, 1996), ISBN 0-415-10782-2, Page: 40&lt;/ref&gt; Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore the pantheist formula &quot;One and All&quot; would apply to Spinoza only if the &quot;One&quot; preserves its transcendence and the &quot;All&quot; were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.&lt;ref name=ts64/&gt;

[[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term &quot;[[Panentheism]]&quot;, rather than &quot;[[Pantheism]]&quot; to describe Spinoza’s view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, &quot;in&quot; God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.&lt;ref name=ts65/&gt; In other words, the world is a [[subset]] of God.

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's [[pantheism]], after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a &quot;Spinozist&quot;, which was the equivalent in his time of being called an atheist. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[Antinomy|antinomies]] (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens; and
* the identity of spirit and nature.

Spinoza's &quot;God or Nature&quot; [''Deus sive Natura''] provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanical]] &quot;[[First Cause]]&quot; or the dead mechanism of the [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|French &quot;Man Machine]].&quot; Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; and called him the &quot;God-intoxicated Man.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws9902/&gt; Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay &quot;The Necessity of Atheism.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word &quot;God&quot; [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. &quot;Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God &lt;ref&gt;&quot;I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.” These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, April 24, 1921, published in the New York Times, April 25, 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33-272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt; is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.

===Spinoza's political theory===
{{Main|Tractatus Theologico-Politicus}}
Late 20th century [[Europe]] demonstrated a greater philosophical interest in Spinoza, often from a [[left-wing]] or [[Marxist]] perspective. [[Karl Marx]] liked his materialistic account of the universe.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Notable philosophers [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Étienne Balibar]] and [[Marilena Chauí]] have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, refers to him as &quot;the prince of philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers heavily influenced by Spinoza include [[Constantin Brunner]] and [[John David Garcia]]. [[Stuart Hampshire]] wrote a major English language study of Spinoza, though [[H. H. Joachim]]'s work is equally valuable. Unlike most philosophers, Spinoza and his work were highly regarded by [[Nietzsche]].

Spinoza was an important philosophical inspiration for [[George Santayana]]. When Santayana graduated from college, he published an essay, “The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza,” in ''The Harvard Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, &quot;The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza,&quot; ''The Harvard Monthly'', 2 (June 1886: 144–52)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he wrote an introduction to ''Spinoza’s Ethics and ‘De intellectus emendatione’''.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, &quot;Introduction,&quot; in ''Spinoza’s Ethics and ‘De intellectus emendatione’''(London: Dent, 1910, vii–xxii)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as &quot;Ultimate Religion,&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, &quot;Ultimate Religion,&quot; in ''Obiter Scripta'', eds. Justus Buchler and Benjamin Schwartz (New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936) 280-297.&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting at [[The Hague]] celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his “master and model” in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, ''Persons and Places'' (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 1986) 233–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza's religious criticism and its effect on the philosophy of language===
[[Image:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]
Philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by [[G. E. Moore]]) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', an allusion to Spinoza's [[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914-16'', p.&amp;nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that &quot;If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.&quot; (6.4311) &quot;The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole.&quot; (6.45) Furthermore, Wittgenstein's interpretation of religious language, in both his early and later career, may be said to bear a family resemblance to Spinoza's pantheism.

[[Leo Strauss]] dedicated his first book (&quot;Spinoza's Critique of Religion&quot;) to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity.&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; More recently [[Jonathan Israel]], Professor of Modern European History at Princeton, has made a detailed case that from 1650-1750 Spinoza was &quot;the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (2001) Radical Enlightenment; Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650-1750, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events leading to Spinoza's excommunication are the basis for a 2010 play by David Ives.   The play &quot;New Jerusalem: The Interrogation of Baruch De Spinoza at Talmud Torah Congregation: Amsterdam, July 27, 1656&quot; was first performed at Theater J in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post July 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza in literature===

Spinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy. The 19th century novelist [[George Eliot]] produced her own translation of the ''Ethics'', the first known English translation of it. Eliot liked Spinoza's vehement attacks on superstition.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; In his Autobiography 'From My Life: Poetry and Truth&quot;, Goethe recounts the way in which Spinoza's ''Ethics'' calmed the sometimes unbearable emotional turbulence of his youth. Goethe later displayed his grasp of Spinoza's metaphysics in a fragmentary elucidation of some Spinozist ontological principles entitled ''Study After Spinoza''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |title=Goethe: Studie nach Spinoza - Aufsätze und Rezensionen |publisher=Textlog.de |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he cited Spinoza alongside Shakespeare and [[Carl Linnaeus]] as one of the three strongest influences on his life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=Linné on line - What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=Linnaeus.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th century novelist, [[W. Somerset Maugham]], alluded to one of Spinoza's central concepts with the title of his novel, ''[[Of Human Bondage]]''. [[Albert Einstein]] named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his world view ([[Weltanschauung]]). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by [[Herbert S. Goldstein|Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein]] whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: &quot;I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws9903&gt;{{cite news

Spinoza is an important historical figure in the [[Netherlands]], where his portrait was featured prominently on the Dutch 1000-[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] [[banknote]], [[legal tender]] until the [[euro]] was introduced in 2002. The highest and most prestigious scientific award of the Netherlands is named the [[Spinozapremie|''Spinoza prijs'' (Spinoza prize)]]. Spinoza was included in a 50 theme canon that attempts to summarise the history of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Entoen.nu |publisher=Entoen.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;
'''Being''' (i.e. '''[[wikt:be|be]]'''+''[[Present participle|-ing]]'', by [[synecdoche]]), is an [[English language|English]] word used for conceptualizing [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and objective aspects of reality, including those fundamental to ''the [[self]]'' —related to and somewhat interchangeable with terms like &quot;[[existence]]&quot; and &quot;[[life|living]]&quot;.
In its [[objective pronoun|objective]] usage &amp;mdash;as in &quot;a being,&quot; or &quot;[a] [[human being]]&quot; &amp;mdash;it refers to a discrete ''life form'' that has properties of [[mind]] (i.e. experience and character, cf. ''[[sentience]]''), which are deemed to constitute a more complex and evolved state than simple [[organism]]s (i.e. that have only &quot;[[biology|life functions]]&quot;).

In abstract usage, &quot;the being&quot; or &quot;one's being&quot; is the mind's [[self-concept|concept of the self]] as a whole [[entity]] —including both [[Mind–body dichotomy|mind and body]] —wherein ''the being'' is [[concept|in the mind]], and the &quot;body&quot; is all [[senses|sensory]] aspects within ''the being''. [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] coined the [[German language|Germanic]] term &quot;[[dasein]]&quot; for this property of ''being'' in his influential work ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'' (&quot;this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term &quot;dasein.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dasein1&quot;&gt;Heidegger, ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'', pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;), in which he argued that ''being'' or &quot;dasein&quot; links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of ''[[world]]''. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an [[innate language]] as the foundation of ''being'', which gives [[Information|signal]] to (and from, cf. [[cognition]]) all aspects of ''being''.
&lt;!-- Heidegger also referred to a concept of a greater &quot;being,&quot; as built upon expressions and expressive power. These lines of thought are controversial, as they have strong connections to Germanic nationalism, and because the context (secular philosophy) was largely divorced from morality,: &quot;Language is the house of Being. In its home man dwells. Those who think and those who create with words are the guardians of this home.&quot; - Martin Heidegger, ''Letter on Humanism'' (1947). --&gt;

In [[philosophy]], being is the object of study of [[metaphysics]], and more specifically [[ontology]]. In these contexts, the term &quot;being,&quot; is typically understood as one's &quot;state of being,&quot; and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) [[experience]], with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from a being's innate ''being'', or personal character.

In its most indeterminate sense, ''being'' could be understood as ''anything'' that can be said [[to be]], which is opposed to nonexistence. For example one could ask: “why is there something instead of nothing?” where “something” implies being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=God's mechanics: how scientists and engineers make sense of religion|first=Guy |last=Consolmagno|pages=20–22|location=San Francisco|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a metaphysician the main problem is not the scientific question of how the universe works, but why the universe (or anything such as a rock) is.

== Animate versus indeterminate ==
As speech utterances in the English language, questions such as the above only have meaning if the utterer and the hearer both can code and decode its words into concepts understood by both of them, raising questions of how they acquired such understandings. One is the concept of [[nothing]]. As nothing cannot be known by any means or method it must mean, in the context of the question, that a specific named object is present or not present in the observer's experience of a set of objects, conditions for which English uses &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not.&quot; The object therefore cannot be the same, at least in language, as its being present, as it may or may not be present. [[Académie française|French Academy]] member [[Étienne Gilson]] summarized this long-known characteristic of the experienced world as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilson|1952|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...the word being is a noun ... it signifies either a being (that is, the substance, nature, and essence of anything existent), or being itself, a property common to all that which can rightly be said to be. ... the same word is the present participle of the verb 'to be.' As a verb, it no longer signifies something that is, nor even existence in general, but rather the very act whereby any given reality actually is, or exists. Let us call this act a 'to be,' in contradistinction to what is commonly called 'a being.' It appears at once that, at least to the mind, the relation of 'to be' to 'being' is not a reciprocal one. 'Being' is conceivable, 'to be' is not. We cannot possibly conceive an 'is' except as belonging to some thing that is, or exists. But the reverse is not true. Being is quite conceivable apart from actual existence; so much so that the very first and the most universal of all the distinctions in the realm of being is that which divides it into two classes, that of the real and that of the possible.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether or not an object is present in a set; that is, exists there as a being, is based on universal experience or evidence of it. Existing objects are present to the experience of anyone. It is a legitimate goal therefore for philosophers of being to try to find a principle or element – a &quot;something&quot; – accounting for the presence of the object over the other possibility, its non-presence. Instead, the philosopher encounters a problem:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilson|1952|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Now, if the 'to be' of a thing could be conceived apart from that which exists, it should be represented in our mind by some note distinct from the concept of the thing itself .... In point of fact, it is not so. There is nothing we can add to a concept in order to make it represent the object as existing; what happens if we add anything to it is that it represents something else.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where being, the noun, is readily accessible to experience and classifiable, being, the participle, is not:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilson|1952|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In short ... philosophy may perhaps be able to tell us everything about that which reality is, but nothing at all concerning this not unimportant detail: the actual existence, or non-existence, of what we call reality .... If he himself [the philosopher] did not exist, he would not be there to ask questions about the nature of reality ... on the other hand, this fundamental fact, which we call existence, soon proves a rather barren topic for philosophic speculation ... It certainly looks like a waste of time to speculate about an object which is clearly recognized as inconceivable&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is not a rejection of existence by Gilson, a leading modern metaphysician in the classical tradition: &quot;philosophers are wholly justified in taking existence for granted ... and in never mentioning it again ....&quot; In Gilson's view, the participial being is a given, a primitive of experience, not subject to proof or investigation, as it is the grounds of proof. A thing must be real, or exist, before anything true or proved can be said about it.

However, Gilson concedes some doubt on the possibility of being wrong:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilson|1952|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;yet, this is taking a chance, for, after all, being itself might happen not to be existentially neutral. In other words, it is quite possible that actual existence may be ... an efficient cause of observable effects ....&quot; He then launches into a history of attempts to conceptualize the inconceivable from the ancient Greeks to the present. Some philosophers who have had more noteworthy theories are [[Parmenides]], [[Leucippus]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine]], [[Plotinus]], [[Aquinas]], [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Leibniz]], [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]], and [[Sartre]].

==Etymology==
Given the origins of the term in [[Western philosophy]], the term has deep historical roots in other languages: [[Greek language|Greek]] ''to einai'', Latin ''esse'', Spanish ''ser'', Fr. ''être'', Ger. ''sein'', Italian ''essere''.

In the [[English language]] '''being''' (''i.e.'' '''[[wikt:be|be]]'''+''[[Present participle|-ing]]'') by [[synecdoche]], the use of the whole to mean the part, being is also the word used for conceptualizing [[Subjectivity|subjective]] aspects fundamental to ''the [[self]]''.
&lt;!-- duplicated from above
—related to and somewhat interchangeable with ideas about human &quot;[[existence]]&quot; and &quot;[[life|living]]&quot; —in which &quot;being&quot; or &quot;[one's/a] state of being&quot; is rooted in personal [[experience]], and reflected in aspects of innate personal character. In its [[objective pronoun|objective]] usage &amp;mdash;as in &quot;a being,&quot; or &quot;[a] [[human being]]&quot; &amp;mdash;it refers to a discrete ''life form'' that has properties of [[mind]] (i.e. experience and character) such that transcend that of mere [[organism]]s (that have only &quot;[[biology|life functions]]&quot;).
--&gt;

==The substantial being==
The term &quot;problem of being&quot; references many different problems, or many different expressions of a general problem, in the history of philosophy. The most general view of it, mentioned in the initial paragraph above, was stated succinctly also by the physician turned philosopher-psychologist, [[William James]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Some problems of philosophy: a beginning of an introduction to philosophy|first=William|last=James|authorlink=William James|pages=38, 40|year=1916|location=New York|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place? ... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge.&quot;

===Being and the substance theorists===
The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle applies the term [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance ([[ousia]]e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their [[definition]]: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing [[Differentia|specific difference]]s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.

[[File:Being Parmenides.png|thumb|right|The being of Parmenides]]
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As [[Substance theory|substance theorists]] they accepted [[A priori and a posteriori|à priori]] the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. [[Parmenides]] reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. [[Heraclitus]], on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

[[Aristotle]] knew of this tradition when he began his ''Metaphysics'', and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle|authorlink=Aristotle|title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]|chapter=Book VII Section 1 (paragraph 1028b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reiterates in no uncertain terms:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Chapter VII, Section 4 (paragraph 1030a).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ....&quot;

===Aristotle's theory of act and potency===
One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the [[Potentiality and actuality|Theory of Act and Potency]]. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that &quot;two-legged&quot; and &quot;animal&quot; are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'', Book IX, Chapter 10 (paragraph 1051b).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one.&quot; Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a &quot;half-being&quot; or a &quot;pre-being&quot;, the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

==The transcendental being==
Many of Thomas' writings were condemned as heretical in 1270 and 1277, but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a [[saint]] in 1328, a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1568, and most of his philosophy became Catholic [[dogma]]. Those who adopt it are called [[Thomism|Thomists]].

===St. Thomas' analogy of being===
In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The metaphysical thought of Thomas Aquinas: from finite being to uncreated being|first=John F. |last=Wippel|page=75|series=Monographs of the Society for Mediaeval and Renaissance Philosophy, No. 1|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically.&quot; His term for analogy is Latin ''analogia''. In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is &quot;the same&quot; as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water ([[Empedocles]]). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: &quot;If things having essences  are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kreyche70&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyche|1959|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a &quot;to be&quot;, which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible:&lt;ref name=Kreyche70/&gt; &quot;essence is related to existence as potency is related to act.&quot;

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

===The transcendentals===
Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five [[predicables]], or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the [[Property (philosophy)|property]], an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated [[Univocity|univocally]] of substances; that is, they refer to &quot;the same thing&quot; found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St, Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the ''transcendentia'', &quot;[[transcendentals]]&quot;, because they &quot;climb above&quot; the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as &quot;the properties of being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A companion to metaphysics|editor-first=Jaegwon |editor-last=Kim|editor2-first=Ernest |editor2-last=Sosa|pages=21–22|series=Blackwell Companions to philosophy|year=1995|contribution=Aquinas, St. Thomas|first=Jan A.|last=Aersten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is generally three or four.

==Being in the age of reason==
Although innovated in the late [[medieval]] period, Thomism was dogmatized in the [[Renaissance]]. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The [[rationalist]] philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on [[Reason]] as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of [[doubt]], with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], the advocates of [[scientific method]], with its emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the [[revolution]]s against rising political [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] based on [[established religion]] and the replacememt of [[faith]] by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as [[Kant]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Hegel]]. Although influential for a time their popularity did not generally survive the horrors of [[Ideology|ideological]] warfare, as the competing ideologies utilized their systems in their platforms. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of [[existentialism]]. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]]. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the [[Jesuit order]].

===Empiricist doubts===
[[Rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural [[Age of reason]], which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=age of reason|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/age+of+reason|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; empiricism is the reliance on sensory data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=empiricism|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, [[Thomas Hobbes]], known as an eccentric denizen of the court of [[Charles II of England]] (an &quot;old bear&quot;), published in 1651 ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'', a political treatise written during the [[English civil war]], containing an early [[manifesto]] in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ....&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the &quot;names agreed upon&quot;). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition (&quot;an absurdity, or senselesse Speech&quot;&lt;ref name=hobbes23&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of &quot;right reasoning,&quot; which is based on &quot;natural sense and imagination&quot;, a kind of sensitivity to nature, as &quot;nature it selfe cannot erre.&quot;

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] attack on [[metaphysics]]. The academic philosophers had arrived at the [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|Theory of Matter and Form]] from consideration of certain natural [[paradox]]es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]], metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental forms]]. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity&quot; and &quot;For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ....&quot; Among Hobbes examples are &quot;round quadrangle&quot;, &quot;immaterial substance&quot;, &quot;free subject.&quot;&lt;ref name=hobbes23/&gt; Of the scholastics he says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, in stead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ....&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as &quot;the Error of Separated Essences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The words &quot;Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like&quot; add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as &quot;Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality&quot;, which &quot;are the names of nothing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are mere &quot;Signes&quot; connecting &quot;one name or attribute to another: as when we say, A man, is, a living body, wee mean not that the Man is one thing, the Living Body another, and the Is, or Being another: but that the Man, and the Living Body, is the same thing;....&quot; &quot;Metaphysiques,&quot; Hobbes says, is &quot;far from the possibility of being understood&quot; and is &quot;repugnant to naturall Reason.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=496–497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the [[great chain of being]], an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

===Idealist systems===
In addition to the [[materialism]] of the empiricists, under the same [[aegis]] of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called [[idealism]], which denied the reality of [[matter]] in favor of the reality of [[mind]]. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists ([[Kant]], [[Hegel]] and others), are considered the beginning of [[continental philosophy]], while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of [[analytical philosophy]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Being in continental philosophy and existentialism==
Some philosophers deny that the concept of &quot;being&quot; has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term &quot;I am&quot; has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that &quot;being&quot; and [[nothing]]ness are closely related, developed in [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy.

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], as well as [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects ([[being in itself]]) and the being of people (''[[Geist (philosophy)|Geist]])''.  Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a &quot;meaning&quot; of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic questions of Being (of why is there something rather than nothing), wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it.  He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is [[present-at-hand]], whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as [[ready-to-hand]].  The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein (&quot;there/here-being&quot;) or '''[[being-in-the-world]].''' Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot; which responds to Sartre's famous address, &quot;Existentialism is a Humanism&quot;), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

==Being in Islamic philosophy==
The nature of &quot;being&quot; has also been debated and explored in [[Islamic philosophy]], notably by [[Ibn Sina]], [[Suhrawardi Maqtul|Suhrawardi]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/personalities/msadra/mulla_sadra.php Iranian Personalities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
&lt;blockquote&gt;As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere ''being''. - [[Carl Jung]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the heading ‘Individuality in Thought and Desire’, [[Karl Marx]], (German Ideology 1845), says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It depends not on consciousness, but on ''being''; not on thought, but on ''life''; it depends on the individual's empirical development and manifestation of life, which in turn depends on the conditions existing in the world.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Birds''' ([[Class (biology)|class]] '''Aves''') are [[feather]]ed, [[bird flight|wing]]ed, [[Bipedalism|biped]]al, [[Endotherm (biology)|endothermic]] ([[warm-blooded]]), [[egg (biology)|egg-laying]], [[vertebrate]] animals. Around 10,000 living species makes them the most speciose class of [[tetrapod]] vertebrates. They inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. [[Extant taxon|Extant]] birds range in size from the {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Bee Hummingbird]] to the {{convert|2.75|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Ostrich]]. The [[Paleontology|fossil record]] indicates birds [[evolution|evolved]] from [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s during the [[Jurassic]] period, around 150–200 million years ago (Ma), and the earliest known bird is the Late Jurassic ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', around 150–145 Ma. Most [[paleontologist]]s regard birds as the only [[clade]] of dinosaurs to have survived the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] approximately 65.5 Ma.

Modern birds are [[body plan|characterised]] by [[feather]]s, a [[beak]] with no [[teeth]], the [[Oviposition|laying]] of [[Eggshell|hard-shelled]] eggs, a high [[metabolism|metabolic]] rate, a four-chambered [[heart]], and a lightweight but strong [[Bird skeleton|skeleton]]. All living species of birds have wings - the now extinct flightless [[Moa]] of [[New Zealand]] was the only exception. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can [[bird flight|fly]], with some exceptions, including [[ratite]]s, [[penguin]]s, and a number of diverse [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] island species. Birds also have unique [[digestive system|digestive]] and [[respiratory system]]s that are highly adapted for flight. Some birds, especially [[corvids]] and [[parrots]], are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of bird species have been observed [[Tool use by animals|manufacturing and using tools]], and many social species exhibit cultural transmission of knowledge across generations.

Many species undertake long distance annual [[bird migration|migrations]], and many more perform shorter irregular movements. Birds are social; they communicate using visual signals and through calls and [[bird song|songs]], and participate in social behaviours, including [[Helpers at the nest|cooperative breeding]] and hunting, [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], and [[Mobbing behavior|mobbing]] of predators. The vast majority of bird species are [[socially monogamous]], usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have [[polygyny|polygynous]] (&quot;many females&quot;) or, rarely, [[polyandry|polyandrous]] (&quot;many males&quot;) breeding systems . Eggs are usually laid in a nest and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.

Many species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired through hunting or farming. Some species, particularly [[songbird]]s and [[parrot]]s, are popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of [[guano]] (droppings) for use as a [[fertiliser]]. Birds [[List of fictional birds|figure prominently]] in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry to popular music. About 120–130 species have become [[extinction|extinct]] as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to [[bird conservation|protect]] them.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
{{Main|Evolution of birds}}
[[File:Naturkundemuseum Berlin - Archaeopteryx - Eichstätt.jpg|alt= Slab of stone with fossil bones and feather impressions|thumb|right|''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the earliest known bird]]
The first [[biological classification|classification]] of birds was developed by [[Francis Willughby]] and [[John Ray]] in their 1676 volume ''Ornithologiae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=del Hoyo |first=Josep |coauthors=Andy Elliott and Jordi Sargatal |title=[[Handbook of Birds of the World]], Volume 1: Ostrich to Ducks |year=1992 |publisher=[[Lynx Edicions]] |location=Barcelona |isbn=84-87334-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carolus Linnaeus]] modified that work in 1758 to devise the [[taxonomic classification]] system currently in use.&lt;ref&gt;

Birds are categorised as the [[Class (biology)|biological class]] Aves in [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. [[Phylogenetic taxonomy]] places Aves in the dinosaur [[clade]] [[Theropoda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Theropoda&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Livezey |first=Bradley C. |month=January |year=2007 |title=Higher-order phylogeny of modern birds (Theropoda, Aves: Neornithes) based on comparative anatomy.

Aves and a sister group, the clade [[Crocodilia]], contain the only living representatives of the [[reptile]] clade [[Archosauria]]. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetically]], Aves is commonly defined as all descendants of the [[most recent common ancestor]] of modern birds and ''[[Archaeopteryx|Archaeopteryx lithographica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Padian|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Padian|coauthor=L.M.

''Archaeopteryx'', from the [[Tithonian]] stage of the [[Late Jurassic]] (some 150–145 Ma), is the earliest known bird under this definition. Others, including [[Jacques Gauthier]] and adherents of the [[Phylocode]] system, have defined Aves to include only the modern bird groups, the [[crown group]].

All modern birds lie within the [[subclass (biology)|subclass]] [[Neornithes]], which has two subdivisions: the [[Palaeognathae]], containing birds that are flightless (like [[ostrich]]es) or weak fliers, and the wildly diverse [[Neognathae]], containing all other birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theropoda&quot;/&gt; These two subdivisions are often given the [[taxonomic rank|rank]] of [[superorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdbiogeography1.htm |title=Bird biogeography |accessdate=2008-04-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Bradley C.

===Dinosaurs and the origin of birds===
{{Main|Origin of birds}}
[[File:Confuchisornis sanctus.JPG|thumb|alt= White slab of rock left with cracks and impression of bird feathers and bone, including long paired tail feathers|''[[Confuciusornis]]'', a Cretaceous bird from China]]
Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialized subgroup of [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[Dinosauria|dinosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prum|first=Richard O. Prum|title=Who's Your Daddy|journal=Science|volume=322|pages=1799–1800|year=2008|doi=10.1126/science.1168808|pmid=19095929|month= December|issue=5909|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they are members of [[Maniraptora]], a group of theropods which includes [[dromaeosaur]]s and [[Oviraptoridae|oviraptorids]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S.

|pages=171–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; As scientists discover more nonavian theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between nonbirds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the [[Liaoning]] Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small [[Feathered dinosaurs|theropod dinosaurs had feathers]], contribute to this ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Norell |first=Mark |coauthors=Mick Ellison |year=2005 |title=Unearthing the Dragon: The Great Feathered Dinosaur Discovery |location=New York

The consensus view in contemporary [[paleontology]] is that the birds, Aves, are the closest relatives of the [[deinonychosaur]]s, which include [[dromaeosaurid]]s and [[troodontid]]s. Together, these three form a group called [[Paraves]]. The [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] dromaeosaur ''[[Microraptor]]'' has features which may have enabled it to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs are very small. This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been [[arboreal]], may have been able to glide, or both.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHTetal07&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner |first=Alan H. |year=2007 |title=A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5843/1378.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=317 |pages=1378–1381 |doi=10.1126/science.1144066 |pmid=17823350 |month= September|issue=5843 |issn=0036-8075 |last2=Pol |first2=D |last3=Clarke |first3=JA |last4=Erickson |first4=GM |last5=Norell |first5=MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xuetal2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Xing, X., Zhou, Z., Wang, X., Kuang, X., Zhang, F., and Du, X.|year=2003|title=Four-winged dinosaurs from China|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=421|issue=6921|pages=335–340|doi=10.1038/nature01342|pmid=12540892|month= January|last1=Xu|first1=X|last2=Zhou|first2=Z|last3=Wang|first3=X|last4=Kuang|first4=X|last5=Zhang|first5=F|last6=Du|first6=X|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Jurassic]] ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is well-known as one of the first [[transitional fossil]]s to be found, and it provided support for the theory of [[evolution]] in the late 19th century. ''Archaeopteryx'' has clearly reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, but it has finely preserved wings with flight feathers identical to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds, but is the oldest and most primitive known member of Aves or [[Avialae]], and it is probably closely related to the real ancestor.&lt;ref name =&quot;mayretal2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2006.00245.x | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | last2 = Phol | first2 = B. | last3 = Hartman | first3 = S. | last4 = Peters | first4 = D.S. | year = 2007 | title = The tenth skeletal specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' | url = | journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 97–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories and controversies===
There have been many controversies in the study of the origin of birds. Early disagreements included whether birds evolved from [[dinosaur]]s or more primitive [[archosaur]]s. Within the dinosaur camp, there were disagreements as to whether [[ornithischia]]n or [[theropod]] dinosaurs were the more likely ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heilmann1927&quot;&gt;Heilmann, Gerhard (1927). ''The Origin of Birds''. New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the hip structure of modern birds, birds are thought to have originated from the [[saurischia]]n (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs, and therefore evolved their hip structure [[Convergent evolution|independently]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasskin-Gutman |first=Diego |month=March |year=2001 |title=Theoretical morphology of the Archosaur (Reptilia: Diapsida) pelvic girdle |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=59–78|doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027&lt;0059:TMOTAR&gt;2.0.CO;2 |last2=Buscalioni |first2=Angela D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a bird-like hip structure evolved a third time among a peculiar group of theropods known as the [[Therizinosauridae]]. A few scientists suggest that birds are not dinosaurs, but evolved from early archosaurs like ''[[Longisquama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feduccia |first=Alan |month=November |year=2005|title=Do feathered dinosaurs exist?

Birds diversified into a wide variety of forms during the [[Cretaceous Period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; Many groups retained [[symplesiomorphy|primitive characteristics]], such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of bird groups, including [[modern birds]] (Neornithes). While the earliest forms, such as ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''[[Jeholornis]]'', retained the long bony tails of their ancestors,&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; the tails of more advanced birds were shortened with the advent of the [[pygostyle]] bone in the [[clade]] Pygostylia.

The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed birds to evolve were the [[Enantiornithes]], or &quot;opposite birds&quot;, so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; More advanced lineages also specialised in eating fish, like the superficially [[gull]]-like subclass of [[Ichthyornithes]] (fish birds).&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|last=Clarke |first=Julia A. |coauthors= |month=September |year=2004 |title=Morphology, Phylogenetic Taxonomy, and Systematics of ''Ichthyornis'' and ''Apatornis'' (Avialae: Ornithurae) |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=286 |pages=1–179 |doi= 10.1206/0003-0090(2004)286&lt;0001:MPTASO&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/454/1/B286.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One order of Mesozoic seabirds, the [[Hesperornithiformes]], became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments, they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. Despite their extreme specializations, the Hesperornithiformes represent some of the closest relatives of modern birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt;

The paleognaths include the [[tinamou]]s of [[Central America|Central]] and South America and the [[ratite]]s. The basal divergence from the remaining Neognathes was that of the [[Galloanserae]], the superorder containing the [[Anseriformes]] ([[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[screamer]]s) and the [[Galliformes]] (the [[pheasant]]s, [[grouse]], and their allies, together with the [[mound builder (bird)|mound builders]] and the [[guan (bird)|guan]]s and their allies). The dates for the splits are much debated by scientists. The Neornithes are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|K–T extinction event]], but there are different opinions about whether the [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ericson&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ericson |first=Per G.P. |month=December |year=2006 |title=Diversification of Neoaves: Integration of molecular sequence data and fossils |journal=[[Biology Letters]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=543–547 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 |pmid=17148284 |url=http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/neoaves.pdf|format=PDF |issn=1744-9561 |last2=Anderson |first2=CL |last3=Britton |first3=T |last4=Elzanowski |first4=A |last5=Johansson |first5=US |last6=Källersjö |first6=M |last7=Ohlson |first7=JI |last8=Parsons |first8=TJ |last9=Zuccon |first9=D |pmc=1834003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while [[fossil]] evidence supports a [[Tertiary]] radiation.

The classification of birds is a contentious issue.

More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.

This is a list of the taxonomic orders in the subclass Neornithes, or modern birds. This list uses the traditional classification (the so-called [[James Clements|Clements]] order), revised by the Sibley-Monroe classification. The [[list of birds]] gives a more detailed summary of the orders, including families.

'''Subclass Neornithes'''&lt;br/&gt;
The subclass Neornithes has two [[superorder]]s&amp;nbsp;–

Superorder [[Palaeognathae]]:

The name of the superorder is derived from ''paleognath'', the ancient Greek for &quot;old jaws&quot; in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds. The Palaeognathae consists of two orders which comprise 49 existing species.

* [[Struthioniformes]]—[[ostrich]]es, [[emu]]s, [[kiwi]]s, and allies
* [[Tinamiformes]]—tinamous

Superorder [[Neognathae]]:

The superorder Neognathae comprises 27 orders which have a total of nearly ten thousand species.
The Neognathae have undergone [[adaptive radiation]] to produce the staggering diversity of form (especially of the bill and feet), function, and behavior that are seen today.

The orders comprising the Neognathae are:
[[Image:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|[[Moa]] attacked by a [[Haast's Eagle]]]]
* [[Anseriformes]]—waterfowl
* [[Galliformes]]—fowl
* [[Charadriiformes]]—[[gull]]s, [[button-quail]]s, [[plover]]s and allies
* [[Gaviiformes]]—loons
* [[Podicipediformes]]—grebes
* [[Procellariiformes]]—[[albatross]]es, [[petrel]]s, and allies
* [[Sphenisciformes]]—penguins
* [[Pelecaniformes]]—[[pelican]]s and allies
* [[Phaethontiformes]]—tropicbirds
* [[Ciconiiformes]]—[[stork]]s and allies
* [[Cathartiformes]]—New World vultures
* [[Phoenicopteriformes]]—flamingos
* [[Falconiformes]]—[[falcon]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s and allies
* [[Gruiformes]]—[[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and allies
* [[Pteroclidiformes]]—sandgrouse
* [[Columbiformes]]—[[Columbidae|doves and pigeons]]
* [[parrot|Psittaciformes]]—[[parrot]]s and allies
* [[Cuculiformes]]—[[cuckoo]]s and [[turaco]]s
* [[Opisthocomiformes]]—hoatzin
* [[owl|Strigiformes]]—owls
* [[Caprimulgiformes]]—[[nightjar]]s and allies
* [[Apodiformes]]—[[swift]]s and [[hummingbird]]s
* [[Coraciiformes]]—[[kingfisher]]s and allies
* [[Piciformes]]—[[woodpecker]]s and allies
* [[Trogoniformes]]—trogons
* [[Coliiformes]]—mousebirds
* [[Passerine|Passeriformes]]—passerines

The radically different Sibley-Monroe classification ([[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]]), based on molecular data, found widespread adoption in a few aspects, as recent molecular, fossil, and anatomical evidence supported the [[Galloanserae]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Ericson&quot;/&gt;

Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a [[body plan]] that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate [[bird flight|flight]].

The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Paul R. |coauthors=David S.

Like the [[reptile]]s, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their [[kidney]]s extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as [[uric acid]] instead of [[urea]] or [[ammonia]] via the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a [[urinary bladder]] or external urethral opening and (with exception of the [[Ostrich#Description|Ostrich]]) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Paul R. |coauthors=David S.

===Chromosomes===
Birds have two sexes: male and female. The sex of birds is determined by the [[ZW sex-determination system|Z and W sex chromosomes]], rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilization. However, one recent study demonstrated [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] among [[Australian Brush-turkeys]], for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male [[sex ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Göth|first=Anne|title=Incubation temperatures and sex ratios in Australian brush-turkey (''Alectura lathami'') mounds|journal=Austral Ecology|year=2007|volume=32|issue=4|pages=278–85|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in [[Feathered dinosaurs|some dinosaurs]] not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate [[bird flight|flight]], provide insulation that aids in [[thermoregulation]], and are used in display, camouflage, and signaling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called [[plumage]], may vary within species by age, [[social status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belthoff |first=James R. |date=1 August 1994|title=Plumage Variation, Plasma Steroids and Social Dominance in Male House Finches |journal=The Condor |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=614–25 |doi=10.2307/1369464 |issn=00105422 |author2=Dufty, |author3=Gauthreaux,}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual dimorphism|sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Guthrie| first=R.

Plumage is regularly [[moult]]ed; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the &quot;non-breeding&quot; plumage, or&amp;nbsp;– in the [[Humphrey-Parkes terminology]]&amp;nbsp;– &quot;basic&quot; plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as &quot;alternate&quot; plumages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphrey |first=Philip S. |date=1 June 1959|title=An approach to the study of molts and plumages |journal=The Auk |volume=76 |pages=1–31 |url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v076n01/p0001-p0031.pdf |doi=10.2307/3677029|format=PDF |issn=09088857 |issue=2 |jstor=3677029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, [[flight feather]]s are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.&lt;ref name=&quot;pettingill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pettingill Jr. OS|year=1970|title=Ornithology in Laboratory and Field|isbn=808716093|publisher=Burgess Publishing Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.&lt;ref name=&quot;debeeretal&quot;&gt;de Beer SJ, Lockwood GM, Raijmakers JHFS, Raijmakers JMH, Scott WA, Oschadleus HD, Underhill LG (2001).

The [[Bird anatomy#Scales|scales]] of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs.

Most birds can [[Flying and gliding animals|fly]], which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb ([[wing]]) that serves as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.

===Migration===
{{Main|Bird migration}}
Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of [[season]]al temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, [[shorebird]]s, and [[waterbird]]s undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the [[temperate]] or [[arctic]]/[[antarctic]] regions and a non-breeding season in the [[tropical]] regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Battley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Klaassen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaassen |first=Marc |coauthors= |date=1 January 1996|title=Metabolic constraints on long-distance migration in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=57–64 |pmid=9317335 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/57 |issn=0022-0949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling.

Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. [[wiktionary:irruptive|Irruptive]] species such as the boreal [[finch]]es are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next.

The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a [[Manx Shearwater]] released in [[Boston]] returned to its colony in [[Skomer]], [[Wales]], within 13 days, a distance of {{convert|5150|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews |first=G.

===Flocking and other associations===
While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large [[flock (birds)|flocks]]. The principal benefits of flocking are [[safety in numbers]] and increased foraging efficiency.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where [[ambush predation]] is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system.

The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times.

Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their [[beak|bills]] in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. [[Passerine|Perching birds]] have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.

====Territories, nesting and incubation====
{{See also|Bird nest}}
Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as [[seabird]]s and [[swift]]s, often breed in [[Bird colony|colonies]] instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H | last2 = Harris | first2 = M | last3 = Wanless | first3 = S | year = 2004 | title = Competition for breeding sites and site-dependent population regulation in a highly colonial seabird, the common guillemot ''Uria aalge''&quot;. | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 367–76 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00813.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All birds lay [[amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay [[camouflage]]d eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting [[nightjar]]s have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of [[brood parasites]] have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booker | first1 = L | last2 = Booker | first2 = M | year = 1991 | title = Why Are Cuckoos Host Specific? | url = http://jstor.org/stable/3565958| journal = [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 301–09 | doi = 10.2307/3565958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Golden-backed Weaver.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Yellow weaver (bird) with black head hangs an upside-down nest woven out of grass fronds.|Male [[Golden-backed Weaver]]s construct elaborate suspended nests out of grass]]
Bird eggs are usually laid in a [[Bird nest|nest]]. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hansell&quot;&gt;Hansell M (2000). ''Bird Nests and Construction Behaviour''. University of Cambridge Press ISBN 0-521-46038-7&lt;/ref&gt; Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; [[albatross]] nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lafuma | first1 = L | last2 = Lambrechts | first2 = M | last3 = Raymond | first3 = M | year = 2001 | title = Aromatic plants in bird nests as a protection against [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] flying insects? | url = | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 113–20 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-6357(01)00191-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and feathers are often used for nest insulation.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hansell&quot;/&gt; Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting [[Common Guillemot]] lays its eggs on bare rock, and male [[Emperor Penguin]]s keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are [[precocial]].

Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through [[brood patch]]es, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as {{convert|83|g}} of body weight per day of incubation.&lt;ref&gt;Warham, J. (1990) ''The Petrels&amp;nbsp;– Their Ecology and Breeding Systems'' London: [[Academic Press]] ISBN 0-12-735420-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of [[megapode]]s comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jones DN, Dekker, René WRJ, Roselaar, Cees S (1995). ''The Megapodes''. Bird Families of the World 3. [[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford. ISBN 0-19-854651-3&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation periods range from 10 days (in [[woodpecker]]s, [[cuckoo]]s and [[passerine]] birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and [[kiwi]]s).&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

====Parental care and fledging====
At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed ''[[altricial]]'', and tend to be born small, [[Blindness|blind]], immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed ''[[precocial]]''. Altricial chicks need help [[thermoregulation|thermoregulating]] and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. Chicks at neither of these extremes can be semi-precocial or semi-altricial.
[[File:Calliope-nest edit.jpg|thumb|alt= Hummingbird perched on edge of tiny nest places food into mouth of one of two chicks|left|A female [[Calliope Hummingbird]] feeding fully grown chicks]]

The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in [[megapode]]s ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot A (1994). &quot;Family Megapodiidae (Megapodes)&quot; in ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]. Volume 2; New World Vultures to Guineafowl'' (eds del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J)  Lynx Edicions:Barcelona. ISBN 84-87337-15-6&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the [[Great Frigatebird]], whose chicks take up to six months to [[fledge]] and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.&lt;ref&gt;Metz VG, Schreiber EA (2002). &quot;Great Frigatebird (''Fregata minor'')&quot; In ''The Birds of North America, No 681'', (Poole, A. and Gill, F., eds) The Birds of North America Inc: Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, [[helpers at the nest|other member]]s of the same species&amp;mdash;usually close relatives of the [[breeding pair]], such as offspring from previous broods&amp;mdash;will help with the raising of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Family living amongst birds | url = | journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 289–98 | doi = 10.1111/j.2006.0908-8857.03666.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such alloparenting is particularly common among the [[Corvida]], which includes such birds as the true [[Corvidae|crows]], [[Australian Magpie]] and [[Fairy-wren]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cockburn A|editor=Floyd R, Sheppard A, de Barro P|title=Frontiers in Population Ecology|year=1996|publisher=CSIRO|location=Melbourne|isbn= |pages=21–42|chapter=Why do so many Australian birds cooperate? Social evolution in the Corvida}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been observed in species as different as the [[Rifleman (bird)|Rifleman]] and [[Red Kite]]. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common&amp;mdash;more so than in any other vertebrate class.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a [[division of labour]] in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3458|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=273|issue=1592|pages=1375–83|pmid=16777726|month= June|issn=0962-8452|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16777726|format=Free full text|pmc=1560291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which chicks [[fledge]] varies dramatically. The chicks of the ''[[Synthliboramphus]]'' murrelets, like the [[Ancient Murrelet]], leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston AJ (1994). Ancient Murrelet (''Synthliboramphus antiquus''). In ''The Birds of North America, No. 132'' (A. Poole and F. Gill, Eds.). Philadelphia: The Academy of Natural Sciences; Washington, D.C.: The American Ornithologists' Union.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = HC | last2 = Eshiamwata | first2 = GW | last3 = Munyekenye | first3 = FB | last4 = Bohning-Gaese | first4 = K | year = 2004 | title = Life-history of two African ''Sylvia'' warblers: low annual fecundity and long post-fledging care | url = | journal = [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] | volume = 146 | issue = 3| pages = 427–37 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicks may also follow their parents during their first [[bird migration|migration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = JC | last2 = Bautista | first2 = LM | last3 = Alonso | first3 = JA | year = 2004 | title = Family-based territoriality vs flocking in wintering common cranes ''Grus grus''&quot;. | url = | journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 434–44 | doi = 10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03290.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brood parasitism]], in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.&lt;ref name = &quot;brood&quot;&gt;Davies N (2000). ''Cuckoos, Cowbirds and other Cheats''. [[T. &amp; A. D. Poyser]]: London ISBN 0-85661-135-2&lt;/ref&gt; After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either ''obligate brood parasites'', which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or ''non-obligate brood parasites'', which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of [[conspecific]]s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/beheco/8.2.153 | last1 = Sorenson | first1 = M | year = 1997 | title = Effects of intra- and interspecific brood parasitism on a precocial host, the canvasback, ''Aythya valisineria'' | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/2/153.pdf | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 153–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred bird species, including [[honeyguide]]s, [[icterid]]s, [[estrildid finch]]es and [[Black-headed Duck|ducks]], are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the [[cuckoo]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;brood&quot;/&gt; Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Spottiswoode| first1=C.

Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.&lt;ref name = &quot;flycatcher&quot;/&gt; While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the [[forest canopy]], others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be [[insectivore]]s, [[frugivore]]s, and [[nectarivore]]s. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or [[kleptoparasitism]]. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised [[scavenger]]s. [[Avivore]]s are animals that are specialized at predating birds.

Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal.&lt;ref name = &quot;Clout&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clout | first1 = M | last2 = Hay | first2 = J | year = 1989 | title = The importance of birds as browsers, pollinators and seed dispersers in New Zealand forests | url = http://www.newzealandecology.org/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol12_s_27.pdf | journal = New Zealand Journal of Ecology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 27–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and pollinating birds often [[coevolution|coevolve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gary Stiles | first1=F. | title=Geographical Aspects of Bird-Flower Coevolution, with Particular Reference to Central America | url=http://jstor.org/stable/2398801 | journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume=68 | issue=2 | pages=323–51 | year=1981 |doi= 10.2307/2398801}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Temeles | first1 = E | last2 = Linhart | first2 = Y | last3 = Masonjones | first3 = M | last4 = Masonjones | first4 = H | year = 2002 | title = The Role of Flower Width in Hummingbird Bill Length–Flower Length Relationships | url = http://www.amherst.edu/~ejtemeles/Temeles%20et%20al%202002%20biotropica.pdf | journal = Biotropica | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 68–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the [[moa]]s were important browsers, as are the [[New Zealand Pigeon|Kereru]] and [[Kokako]] today.&lt;ref name = &quot;Clout&quot;/&gt; Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bond | first1=William J. | last2=Lee | first2=William G. | last3=Craine | first3=Joseph M. | title=Plant structural defences against browsing birds: a legacy of New Zealand's extinct moas | journal=Oikos | volume=104 | pages=500–08 | year=2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12720.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nesting [[seabird]]s may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of [[guano]], which may enrich the local soil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainright | first1 = S | last2 = Haney | first2 = J | last3 = Kerr | first3 = C | last4 = Golovkin | first4 = A | last5 = Flint | first5 = M | year = 1998 | title = Utilization of nitrogen derived from seabird guano by terrestrial and marine plants at St. Paul, Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/DN8D70RYM7TUF42P.pdf | journal = Marine Ecology | volume = 131 | issue = 1| pages = 63–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surrounding seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3354/meps032247 | last1 = Bosman | first1 = A | last2 = Hockey | first2 = A | year = 1986 | title = Seabird guano as a determinant of rocky intertidal community structure | url = http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/32/m032p247.pdf | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 247–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic importance===
Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called [[poultry]], are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, {{Nowrap|76 million}} tons of poultry and {{Nowrap|61 million}} tons of eggs were produced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Out/Ote3_3.htm|title= Shifting protein sources: Chapter 3: Moving Up the Food Chain Efficiently.|publisher=

Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|wild turkeys]], [[quail]], [[dove]]s, [[partridge]], [[grouse]], [[snipe]], and [[woodcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | unused_data = DUPLICATE DATA: url = | last1 = Simeone | first1 = A | last2 = Navarro | first2 = X | year = 2002 | title = Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene | url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0716-078X2002000200012&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | journal = Rev.

Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the [[Down feather|down]] of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird feces ([[guano]]), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The [[War of the Pacific]], sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/19cen/guanowar.html|title= The Guano War of 1865–1866.|publisher= World History at KMLA|accessdate= 18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as [[Parrot (family)|parrots]] and [[myna]]s, are bred in [[aviculture|captivity]] or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0030605306000056 | last1 = Cooney | first1 = R | last2 = Jepson | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = The international wild bird trade: what's wrong with blanket bans? | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=409231 | journal = Oryx | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 18–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falcon]]s and [[cormorant]]s have long been used for [[Falconry|hunting]] and fishing, respectively. [[Messenger pigeon]]s, used since at least 1&amp;nbsp;AD, remained important as recently as [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4140937 | last1 = Manzi | first1 = M | last2 = Coomes | year = 2002 | first2 = O.

===Religion, folklore and culture===

Birds play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion, and [[popular culture]]. In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a [[deity]], such as in the Cult of [[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]], in which the [[Tangata manu]] of [[Easter Island]] served as chiefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Routledge | first1 = S | last2 = Routledge | first2 = K | year = 1917 | title = The Bird Cult of Easter Island | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 337–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as attendants, as in the case of [[Hugin and Munin]], two [[Common Raven]]s who whispered news into the ears of the [[Norse god]] [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Lukas | first1= SE | last2= Benedikt | first2= R | last3= Mendelson | first3= JH | last4= Kouri | first4= E | last5= Sholar | first5= M | last6= Amass | first6= L | title= Marihuana attenuates the rise in plasma ethanol levels in human subjects. | journal= Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume= 7 | issue= 1 | pages= 77–81 | year= 1992 | pmid= 1326277 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priests were involved in [[augur]]y, or interpreting the words of birds while the &quot;auspex&quot; (from which the word &quot;auspicious&quot; is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, Ernest (1923). [http://www.archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge Archive.org], &quot;Birds in legend, fable and folklore&quot;. Longmans, Green and co. p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; They may also serve as [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], as when [[Jonah]] (Hebrew: '''יוֹנָה''', [[dove]]) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Hauser| first1= A.

''Extinct Birds of New Zealand'' Te Papa Press, Wellington ISBN 978-0-909010-21-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have been featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early [[cave painting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meighan | first1=C. W. | title=Prehistoric Rock Paintings in Baja California | url=http://jstor.org/stable/2694739 | journal=American Antiquity | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=372–92 | year=1966 |doi= 10.2307/2694739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were later used in religious or symbolic art and design, such as the magnificent [[Peacock Throne]] of the [[Mughal era|Mughal]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = CP | year = 1908 | title = A Pedestal of the Platform of the Peacock Throne | url = http://jstor.org/stable/3252550| journal = The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 182–83 | doi = 10.2307/3252550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books. Among the most famous of these bird artists was [[John James Audubon]], whose paintings of [[List of North American birds|North American birds]] were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the [[National Audubon Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boime | first1=Albert | title=John James Audubon: a birdwatcher's fanciful flights | journal=Art History | volume=22 | pages=728–55 | year=1999 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8365.00184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, [[Homer]] incorporated [[Nightingale]]s into his ''[[Odyssey]]'', and [[Catullus]] used a [[sparrow]] as an erotic symbol in his [[Catullus 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chandler | first1 = A | year = 1934 | title = The Nightingale in Greek and Latin Poetry | url = | journal = The Classical Journal | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 78–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between an [[albatross]] and a sailor is the central theme of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]], which led to the use of the [[Albatross (metaphor)|term as a metaphor for a 'burden']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Lasky | first1= E. D. | title= A Modern Day Albatross: The Valdez and Some of Life's Other Spills | url= http://jstor.org/stable/820195 | journal= The English Journal | volume= 81 | issue= 3 | pages= 44–46 | year= 1992 |doi= 10.2307/820195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[English language|English]] metaphors derive from birds; [[vulture fund]]s and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = A | year = 1998 | title = Vulture Investors, Predators of the 90s: An Ethical Examination | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/W676R8803NL06L38.pdf | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 543–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceptions of various bird species often vary across cultures. [[Owl]]s are associated with bad luck, [[witchcraft]], and death in parts of Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Enriquez PL, Mikkola H (1997). &quot;Comparative study of general public owl knowledge in Costa Rica, Central America and Malawi, Africa&quot;. pp. 160–66 In: J.R. Duncan, D.H. Johnson, T.H. Nicholls, (Eds). ''Biology and conservation of owls of the Northern Hemisphere. General Technical Report NC-190'', USDA Forest Service, St. Paul, Minnesota. 635 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; but are regarded as wise across much of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis DP (2005). [http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Mythology&amp;title=Myth+and+Culture Owlpages.com], Owls in Mythology and Culture. Retrieved on 15 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoopoe]]s were considered sacred in [[Ancient Egypt]] and symbols of virtue in [[Persia]], but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dupree | first1 = N | year = 1974 | title = An Interpretation of the Role of the Hoopoe in Afghan Folklore and Magic | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 173–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===

Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the [[Barn Swallow]] and [[European Starling]], they have caused population decreases or [[extinction]] in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times,&lt;ref&gt;Fuller E (2000). ''Extinct Birds'' (2nd ed.). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, New York. ISBN 0-19-850837-9&lt;/ref&gt; although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of [[Melanesia]]n, [[Polynesia]]n, and [[Micronesia]]n islands.&lt;ref&gt;Steadman D (2006). ''Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds'', University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-0-226-77142-7&lt;/ref&gt; Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as [[threatened species|threatened]] by [[Birdlife International]] and the [[IUCN]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=BirdLife International announces more Critically Endangered birds than ever before |publisher=[[Birdlife International]] |date=14 May 2009 |url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/pr/2009/05/red_list.html |accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8045971.stm |first=Mark |last=Kinver |title=Birds at risk reach record high |publisher= BBC News Online |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conserving Bird Biodiversity: General Principles and their Application'' Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-78949-3&lt;/ref&gt; Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to [[bird strike|structural collisions]] or [[long-line fishing]] [[bycatch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0006-3207(91)90031-4 | last1 = Brothers | first1 = NP | year = 1991 | title = Albatross mortality and associated bait loss in the Japanese longline fishery in the southern ocean | url = | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 255–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pollution (including [[oil spill]]s and pesticide use),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wurster | first1 = D | last2 = Wurster | first2 = C | last3 = Strickland | first3 = W | year = 1965 | title = Bird Mortality Following DDT Spray for Dutch Elm Disease | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 488–99 | doi = 10.1126/science.148.3666.90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; competition and predation from nonnative [[invasive species]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackburn | first1 = T | last2 = Cassey | first2 = P | last3 = Duncan | first3 = R | last4 = Evans | first4 = K | last5 = Gaston | first5 = K | year = 2004 | title = Avian Extinction and Mammalian Introductions on Oceanic Islands | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 305 | issue = | pages = 1955–58 | doi = 10.1126/science.1101617 | pmid=15448269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate change.

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California Condor]] and [[Norfolk Parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1 = Butchart | first1 = S | last2 = Stattersfield | first2 = A | last3 = Collar | first3 = N | year = 2006 | title = How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url = http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal = Oryx | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 266–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.webcitation.org/5iPw98VWZ Archived] 2009-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a worldwide commercial success, reaching the top five in 19 countries, and number one in 15, including the [[U.S]] [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album and its singles helped propel Spears into mainstream popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Top 40 Pop Songs of All Time | work=Top40.com | url=http://top40.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/top40essentialsongsalltime.02.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iPw9afmB|archivedate=July 20, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the lead single &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot;, Spears became a pop phenomenon; the single peaked at number one in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=''Britney Spears Chart History'' | work=Billboard Magazine | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=''Britney Spears Charts'' |publisher=AllMusic.com and Billboard | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p320976|pure_url=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat Spears would not repeat for another ten years, in October 2008, when her single &quot;[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]&quot; peaked at number one on the chart. Every single released in the United Kingdom charted within the top-five position in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the top-three position in the [[Eurochart Hot 100]].

The album's lyrics, and its music videos maintained the typical virgin image of the late 1990s teen pop revival for Spears. The album is certified 14× Platinum by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=RIAA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=RIAA Top 100 Albums |publisher=Riaa.com |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2009| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqv3Gpco | archivedate = January 17, 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''...Baby One More Time'' has sold 26&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide, becoming one of the most successful albums of all time and is Spears' most successful and best selling album to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;petridis1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/28/britney-spears-circus | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Britney Spears: Circus | date=November 27, 2008 | first=Alexis | last=Petridis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After returning to Kentwood upon the cancellation of [[The Mickey Mouse Club#1990s revival, The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (MMC)|The New Mickey Mouse Club]], her lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] arranged an audition with senior vice president of [[A&amp;R]] of Jive Records, Jeff Fenster. Fenster stated about Spears, &quot;It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal&quot;. After the audition, she briefly joined girl group [[Innosense]], but later quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=by MacKenzie Wilson |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p435368|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Innosense &gt; Biography ))) |publisher=allmusic |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White. Feeling hopeful about the recorded material in the very first sessions, Spears started promoting the album almost a year before the album was released. Spears flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Sweden]], where half of the album was recorded in March and April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz PoP]] and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5939508/page/2 |title=Inside the Bedroom of America's New Teen Queen |work=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production on the album wrapped in November 1998 with the recording of the cover version of [[Sonny Bono]] and [[Cher]]'s &quot;[[The Beat Goes On]]&quot;, produced by the UK band [[All Seeing I]].

The [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] release had the same cover that was later included in &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; single booklet. The international edition has an alternative cover picture. It is a picture of Spears in white, with her hands in a praying gesture. The picture also resembles the cover artwork of [[Björk]]'s album ''[[Debut (Björk album)|Debut]]''.

Upon its initial release in the US, the album's disc was printed with different colors on the label. The colors were; blue background and yellow flower, pink background and green flower, or yellow background and purple flower. It is now more common to come across copies with the blue label.

==Composition==
Spears had originally not envisioned creating a pop album, she imagined herself singing, in her own words, &quot;[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more [[adult contemporary]]&quot; but she was happy about going along with pop music stating, &quot;It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it -- it's more me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/britneyspears/articles/story/5938512/cover_story_britney_spears |title=1999 Rolling Stones Interview |work=Rolling Stone  |author=Steven DalyPosted Apr 15, 1999 12:00&amp;nbsp;AM |date=April 15, 1999 &lt;!-- 12:00&amp;amp;nbsp;AM --&gt; |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''...Baby One More Time'' has a euro [[dance-pop]] feel that draw comparisons to contemporary pop bands of the 1990s, such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [['N Sync]]. The album is primarily pop, and the songs have characteristic [[hook (music)|hooks]] and draws from pop genres such as [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] and [[teen pop]]. Like most teen pop albums of the 90s, ''...Baby One More Time'' focuses primarily on teenage themes, such as [[love]], break-up, [[desire (emotion)|desire]] and [[happiness|joy]].

&quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot;, the first single and the first track of the album, became the biggest hit of Spears’ career and reached number one in every country it was released in. Its accompanying music video with Spears as a Catholic [[school girl]] exposing her [[midriff]] generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5939508/page/3 |title=Inside the Bedroom of America's New Teen Queen |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 15, 1999 |accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]&quot;, the second track, was released as the third single and became an international success. The song was remixed, released as The Stop! Remix, to promote the movie ''[[Drive Me Crazy]]''. &quot;[[Sometimes (Britney Spears song)|Sometimes]]&quot;, the second single of the album and the album's third track, is a [[pop ballad]] that is about falling in love, reached the top ten in 13 countries. &quot;Soda Pop&quot;, the fourth track of the album, was warmly received, described as a &quot;delightful [[bubblegum pop]] [[ragga]] track&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r384763|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( ...Baby One More Time &gt; Review ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=January 12, 1999 |accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Born to Make You Happy]]&quot;, the fifth track, a [[tempo|mid-tempo]] bubblegum song, was released as the fourth single in Europe and charted as well as its predecessor. This became her first single to be released only outside the nation, though despite its success Spears asked the song to be rewritten since the lyrics were a bit too sexual for her career at the moment. &quot;[[From the Bottom of My Broken Heart]]&quot;, a ballad that recalls the loss of first love, was released as the fourth single in the United States and Australia where it peaked at number 14 and 37, respectively due to its high sales.

&quot;I Will Be There&quot;, the seventh track, is about joy and [[friendship]]. &quot;I Will Still Love You&quot;, a duet with Don Phillip, tells the story of eternal love. The ninth track &quot;Thinkin’ About You&quot;, is an [[uptempo]] pop song. &quot;E-Mail My Heart&quot;, the tenth song, received negative reviews and was deemed as one of the most forgettable songs of the album. The closing track &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, is a [[Album cover|cover]] from [[Sonny &amp; Cher]]’s ''In Case You’re in Love'' (1967). On early pressings of the album prior to May 1999, there is a commercial by Britney after this song. In the message, Spears advertises her label mates the [[Backstreet Boys]]'  [[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]], and playing snippets of the singles from their album. The running time of &quot;The Beat Goes On with the special message at the end is 5:53.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=YouTube&amp;nbsp;—Baby One More Time Hidden Track/ Britney Talks About the Backstreet Boys |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aki5lBzvHk|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gpOZaXz5|archivedate=May 16, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britney covered &quot;I'll Never Stop Loving You&quot; from '90s singer [[J'Son]]. The song is included as B-side to the first single [[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]] and also a bonus track off the album. She also wrote her first song, called &quot;I'm So Curious&quot;, it's a B-side to the single &quot;[[Sometimes (Britney Spears song)|Sometimes]]&quot;.

==Promotion==
In early 1998, Spears' did several promotions including the &quot;Hair Zone Mall Tour&quot; was a 1999 shopping mall tour. Spears did small sets in malls and food courts around the US, mostly in larger cities. Her set was around 30&amp;nbsp;minutes, and she had two female dancers with her on the stage. Her label, [[Jive Records]], has said that this tour was created to promote Spears' for her debut album (...Baby One More Time) and prepare for her first major tour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[card game]]s, a '''burn card''' is a [[playing card]] dealt from the top of a deck, and discarded (&quot;burned&quot;), unused by the players. Burn cards are almost always placed face down next to the discard pile without being revealed to the players.

Burning is most often performed in [[casino]]s to deter a form of cheating known as [[card marking]]. In [[poker]], for example, the top card of the deck stub is burned at the beginning of each betting round, so that players who might have been able to read markings on that card during the previous round are less able to take advantage of that information. Knowledge of a burn card might be marginally useful, such as knowing there is one less Ace in the deck, but far less so than having it in play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgpfaq.com/burn-card.html What is a burn card and why is it dealt?], rec.gambling.poker FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

Burning can also be used to prevent [[second dealing]].

Burning also provides extra cards for use when an irregularity of play occurs.  Sometimes a misdealt card (such as one of the down cards in poker that has flashed during the deal) will be used as the burn card—in those cases, the card should be immediately placed face up on the deck after the deal is complete.

In [[Texas hold 'em]], a card is burned before the [[Flop (poker)|flop]], before the [[turn (poker)|turn]], and before the [[river (poker)|river]].

'''Bulgaria''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Bulgaria.ogg|ˌbʌlˈgerijə}}; {{lang-bg|България}}; officially the '''Republic of Bulgaria''' {{lang|bg|Република България}}, translit. ''Republika Bulgaria'',&lt;ref name=&quot;transl&quot;&gt;[http://bg.wikisource.org/wiki/Закон_за_транслитерацията Закон за транслитерацията, чл.6]&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-mk|rɛˈpublikɐ bɤ̞ɫˈɡarijɐ|}}), is a country in [[Southeast Europe]]. Bulgaria borders five other countries: [[Romania]] to the north (mostly along the [[Danube]]), [[Serbia]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the west, and [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south. The [[Black Sea]] defines the extent of the country to the east.

With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2|sp=us}}, Bulgaria ranks as the [[List of European countries by area|16th-largest country]] in Europe. Several mountainous areas define the landscape, most notably the [[Stara Planina]] (''Balkan'') and [[Rhodope Mountains|Rodopi]] mountain ranges, as well as the [[Rila]] range, which includes the highest peak in the Balkan region, [[Musala]]. In contrast, the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian plain]] in the north and the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] in the south represent Bulgaria's lowest and most fertile regions. The {{convert|378|km|adj=on|sp=us}} Black Sea coastline covers the entire eastern bound of the country. Bulgaria's capital city and largest settlement is [[Sofia]].&lt;ref name=grao&gt;{{cite web

The emergence of a unified Bulgarian ethnicity and state dates back to the 7th century AD. All Bulgarian political entities that subsequently emerged preserved the traditions (in ethnic name, language and alphabet) of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (681–1018), which at times covered most of the [[Balkans]] and eventually became a cultural hub for the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Bulgaria}}

===Prehistory and antiquity===
{{See|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe|Thrace|Odrysian kingdom|Slavs}}
[[File:Panagyurishte gold.jpg|250|thumb|left|A golden [[rhyton]], one of the items in the [[Thracian]] [[Panagyurishte treasure]], dating from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC]]

Prehistoric cultures in the Bulgarian lands include the [[Neolithic]] [[Hamangia culture]] and [[Vinča culture]] (6th to 3rd millennia BC), the [[eneolithic]] [[Varna culture]] (5th millennium BC; see also [[Varna Necropolis]]), and the [[Bronze Age]] [[Ezero culture]]. The [[Karanovo chronology]] serves as a gauge for the prehistory of the wider Balkans region.

The [[Thracians]], one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians, lived separated in various tribes until King [[Teres I|Teres]] united most of them around 500 BC in the [[Odrysian kingdom]]. They were eventually subjugated by [[Alexander the Great]] and later by the [[Roman Empire]]. After migrating from their original homeland, the easternmost [[South Slavs]] settled on the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century and assimilated the Hellenized or [[Romanised Thracian]]s. Eventually the [[Bulgar]] élite incorporated all of them into the First Bulgarian Empire.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bulgaria/History]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, Bulgars and Slavs were mutually assimilated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulgaria&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84090/Bulgaria Bulgaria]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Bulgarian Empire===
{{Main|First Bulgarian Empire}}

[[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]], heir of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]'s khan [[Kubrat]], migrated with several Bulgar tribes to the lower courses of the rivers [[Danube]], [[Dniester]] and [[Dniepr]] (known as ''Ongal'') after his father's state was subjugated by the [[Khazars]]. He conquered [[Moesia]] and [[Scythia Minor]] ([[Dobrudzha]]) from the [[Byzantine Empire]], expanding his new kingdom further into the Balkan Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 and the establishment of a Bulgarian capital at [[Pliska]] south of the Danube mark the beginning of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].

[[File:Krum1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Khan Krum]] feasts with his nobles after the battle of Pliska. His servant (far right) brings the wine-filled [[skull cup]] of emperor Nicephorus I.]]

Succeeding khans strengthened the Bulgarian state — [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] (700-721) established Bulgaria as a major military power by defeating a 26,000-strong [[Arab]] army during the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|Second Arab Siege of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;C. de Boor (ed), ''Theophanis chronographia'', vol. 1.

After Simeon's death, Bulgaria declined during the mid-10th century, weakened by wars with [[Croatians]], Magyars, [[Pecheneg]]s and [[Serb]]s, and the spread of the [[Bogomilism|Bogomil heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84090/Bulgaria/42725/The-spread-of-Christianity Reign of Simeon I], Encyclopaedia Britannica.

===Second Bulgarian Empire===
{{Main|Uprising of Asen and Peter|Second Bulgarian Empire}}
[[File:Campaigns of Ivan Assen II.png|thumb|right|The Bulgarian Empire under [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Tsar Ivan Asen II]]]]

[[Basil II]] managed to prevent rebellions by retaining the local rule of the Bulgarian nobility, who were incorporated into [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|Byzantine aristocracy]] as [[archon]]s or [[strategos|strategoi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Zlatarski&quot;&gt;

However, it was not until 1185 when [[Asen dynasty]] nobles [[Ivan Asen I]] and [[Peter IV of Bulgaria|Peter IV]] organized a major uprising and succeeded in reestablishing the Bulgarian state, marking the beginning of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

The Asen dynasty set up its capital in [[Veliko Tarnovo]]. [[Kaloyan]], the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominions to Belgrade, [[Nish]] and [[Skopie]]; he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of [[the Pope]], and received a royal crown from a [[papal legate]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; Cultural and economic growth persisted under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241), who extended Bulgaria's control over [[Albania]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], Macedonia and Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;Jiriček, p.295&lt;/ref&gt; The achievements of the [[Tarnovo artistic school]] as well as the first coins to be minted by a Bulgarian ruler were only a few signs of the empire's welfare at that time.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

[[File:Ivan shishman preobravenski manastir.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]], the last ruler of the Tarnovo Tsardom (1371–1395)]]

The Asen dynasty ended in 1257, and due to [[Tatar invasions]] (beginning in the later 13th century), internal conflicts, and constant attacks from the Byzantines and the Hungarians, the country's military and economic might declined. By the end of the 14th century, factional divisions between Bulgarian feudal landlords (''[[boyars|bolyari]]'') and the spread of [[Bogomilism]] had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three small tsardoms (At Vidin, Tarnovo and Karvuna) and several semi-independent principalities that fought among themselves, and also with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, [[Venetian Republic|Venetians]] and [[Genoese Republic|Genoese]]. In the period 1365–1370, the [[Ottoman Turks]], who had already started their invasion of the Balkans, conquered most Bulgarian towns and fortresses south of the Balkan Mountains and began their northwards conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Jiriček, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of the Second Empire and Ottoman rule===
{{Main|History of early Ottoman Bulgaria|National awakening of Bulgaria}}

In 1393, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] captured Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, after a three-month siege. In 1396, the Vidin Tsardom fell after the defeat of a Christian [[crusade]] at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. With this, the Ottomans finally subjugated and occupied Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;

Throughout the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian people responded to the oppression by strengthening the ''[[haydut]]'' (&quot;outlaw&quot;) tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulgaria&quot;/&gt; and attempted to reestablish their state by organizing several revolts, most notably the [[First Tarnovo Uprising|First]] and [[Second Tarnovo Uprising]]s (1598 / 1686) and [[Karposh's Rebellion]] (1689). The [[National awakening of Bulgaria]] became one of the key factors in the struggle for [[Liberation of Bulgaria|liberation]], resulting in the 1876 [[April uprising]]—the largest and best-organized Bulgarian rebellion. Though crushed by the Ottoman authorities—in reprisal, the Turks massacred some 15,000 Bulgarians&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulgaria&quot;/&gt;—the uprising prompted the [[Great Powers]] to take action. They convened the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottoman authorities, which allowed the [[Russian Empire]] to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other Great Powers (as had happened in the [[Crimean War]] of 1854 to 1856).

The [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–78 resulted in the defeat of Ottoman forces by the Russian Army (supported by Bulgarian volunteer forces and the [[Romanian Army]]) and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (3 March 1878), which set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality. The [[great power|Great Powers]] immediately rejected the treaty, fearing that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests.

Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became involved in a string of three consecutive conflicts - the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]]. After a disastrous defeat in the [[Second Balkan War]], Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the [[Central Powers]] in World War I. Despite achieving several decisive victories at [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Doiran]], [[Battle of Monastir (1917)|Monastir]] and again at [[Battle of Doiran|Doiran in 1918]], the country capitulated in 1918 and suffered significant territorial losses,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulgaria&quot;/&gt; a total of 412,000 casualties, and a wave of more than 253,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Mintchev 1999 124&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=473FBAEF-623D-4ADA-903A-17241B78BDDB |title=External Migration... in Bulgaria |last=Mintchev |first=Vesselin |journal=South-East Europe Review |issue=3/99 |accessdate=18 February 2007 |month=October|year=1999 |pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; refugees who put an additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

[[File:Rozhen pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sandstone]] formations near [[Sandanski]], southern Bulgaria]]
[[File:Raysko-praskalo-cc-karalamov.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Raysko Praskalo]] waterfall]]

Bulgaria lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[45th parallel north|45° N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22°]] and [[29th meridian east|29° E]].

Geographically and in terms of climate, Bulgaria features notable diversity, with the landscape ranging from the [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] snow-capped peaks in [[Rila]], [[Pirin]] and the [[Balkan Mountains]] to the mild and sunny Black Sea coast; from the typically [[continental climate|continental]] [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]] (ancient [[Moesia]]) in the north to the strong [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climatic influence]] in the valleys of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and in the lowlands in the southernmost parts of [[Thrace]].
