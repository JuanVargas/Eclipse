From Bononia they crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] to Britain and made their way to [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), capital of the province of [[Britannia Secunda]] and home to a large military base. Constantine was able to spend a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the [[Picts]] beyond [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the summer and autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27, 298; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 77–78, 309; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius's campaign, like that of [[Septimius Severus]] before it, probably advanced far into the north without achieving great success.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, 233–34; Southern, 170, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius had become severely sick over the course of his reign, and died on 25 July 306 in [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]). Before dying, he declared his support for raising Constantine to the rank of full Augustus. The [[Alamanni]]c king [[Chrocus]], a barbarian taken into service under Constantius, then proclaimed Constantine as Augustus. The troops loyal to Constantius' memory followed him in acclamation. Gaul and Britain quickly accepted his rule;&lt;ref name=&quot;N35&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27–28; Jones, 59; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61–62; Odahl, 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Iberia, which had been in his father's domain for less than a year, rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine sent Galerius an official notice of Constantius's death and his own acclamation. Along with the notice, he included a portrait of himself in the robes of an Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28–29; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62; Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait was wreathed in [[Bay Laurel|bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 59; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He requested recognition as heir to his father's throne, and passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army, claiming they had &quot;forced it upon him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius was put into a fury by the message; he almost set the portrait on fire. His advisers calmed him, and argued that outright denial of Constantine's claims would mean certain war.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28–29; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62; Odahl, 79–80; Rees, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius was compelled to compromise: he granted Constantine the title &quot;Caesar&quot; rather than &quot;Augustus&quot; (The latter office went to Severus instead).&lt;ref name=&quot;GCA&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41; Jones, 59; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing to make it clear that he alone gave Constantine legitimacy, Galerius personally sent Constantine the emperor's traditional [[Tyrian purple|purple robes]].&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine accepted the decision,&lt;ref name=&quot;GCA&quot;/&gt; knowing that it would remove doubts as to his legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's share of the Empire consisted of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded one of the largest Roman armies, stationed along the important [[Rhine]] frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, and secured his control in the northwestern [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon left for [[History of Trier#Roman Empire|Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franks]], after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–7.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and their soldiers were fed to the beasts of Trier's amphitheater in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' (arrival) celebrations that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 63; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39–40; Odahl, 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Trier Kaiserthermen BW 1.JPG|thumb|[[Public bathing|Public baths]] (''[[thermae]]'') built in [[Trier]] by Constantine. More than {{convert|100|m|0}} wide by {{convert|200|m|0}} long, and capable of serving several thousands at a time, the baths were built to rival those of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Constantine began a major expansion of Trier. He strengthened the circuit wall around the city with military towers and fortified gates, and began building a palace complex in the northeastern part of the city. To the south of his palace, he ordered the construction of a large formal audience hall, and a massive imperial bathhouse. Constantine sponsored many building projects across Gaul during his tenure as emperor of the West, especially in Augustodunum ([[Autun]]) and Arelate ([[Arles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 82–83. See also: William E. Gwatkin, Jr. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CJ/29/1/Roman_Trier*.html Roman Trier].&quot; ''The Classical Journal'' 29 (1933): 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lactantius, Constantine followed his father in following a tolerant policy towards Christianity. Although not yet a Christian, he probably judged it a more sensible policy than open persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 24.9; Barnes, &quot;Lactantius and Constantine&quot;, 43–46; Odahl, 85, 310–11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a way to distinguish himself from the &quot;great persecutor&quot;, Galerius.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine decreed a formal end to persecution, and returned to Christians all they had lost during the persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because Constantine was still largely untried and had a hint of illegitimacy about him, he relied on his father's reputation in his early propaganda: the earliest panegyrics to Constantine give as much coverage to his father's deeds as to those of Constantine himself.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's military skill and building projects soon gave the panegyrist the opportunity to comment favorably on the similarities between father and son, and Eusebius remarked that Constantine was a &quot;renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father's life and reign&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)3.4; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.22, qtd. and tr. Odahl, 83; Rodgers, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinian coinage, sculpture and oratory also shows a new tendency for disdain towards the &quot;barbarians&quot; beyond the frontiers. After Constantine's victory over the Alemanni, he minted a coin issue depicting weeping and begging Alemannic tribesmen—&quot;The Alemanni conquered&quot;—beneath the phrase &quot;Romans' rejoicing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little sympathy for these enemies. As his panegyrist declared: &quot;It is a stupid clemency that spares the conquered foe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxentius' rebellion===
Following Galerius' recognition of Constantine as emperor, Constantine's portrait was brought to Rome, as was customary. [[Maxentius]] mocked the portrait's subject as the son of a harlot, and lamented his own powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2.9.2; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius, jealous of Constantine's authority,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Odahl, 86; Potter, 346.&lt;/ref&gt; seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306. Galerius refused to recognize him, but failed to unseat him. Galerius sent [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30–31; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41–42; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62–63; Odahl, 86–87; Potter, 348–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307. He offered to marry his daughter [[Fausta]] to Constantine, and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted, and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius political recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 64; Odahl, 87–88; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maxentius02 pushkin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Dresden bust of Maxentius]]
Constantine remained aloof from the Italian conflict, however. Over the spring and summer of 307, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 62–63; Odahl, 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308, he raided the territory of the [[Bructeri]], and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium ([[Cologne]]). In 310, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 63–65; Odahl, 89; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–8, but soon fell out with his son. In early 309, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 64; Odahl, 89, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 November 308, Galerius called a general council at the military city of [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]) to resolve the instability in the western provinces. In attendance were Diocletian, briefly returned from retirement, Galerius, and Maximian. Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar. [[Licinius]], one of Galerius' old military companions, was appointed Augustus of the west. The new system did not last long: Constantine refused to accept the demotion, and continued to style himself as Augustus on his coinage, even as other members of the Tetrarchy referred to him as a Caesar on theirs. [[Maximinus Daia]] was frustrated that he had been passed over for promotion while the newcomer Licinius had been raised to the office of Augustus, and demanded that Galerius promote him. Galerius offered to call both Maximinus and Constantine &quot;sons of the Augusti&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32–34; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 42–43; Jones, 61; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 65; Odahl, 90–91; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 349–50; Treadgold, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; but neither accepted the new title. By the spring of 310, Galerius was referring to both men as Augusti.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 33; Jones, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximian's rebellion===
[[File:Constantine multiple CdM Beistegui 233.jpg|right|thumb|A gold multiple of Constantine with Sol Invictus, struck in 313. The use of Sol's image appealed to both the educated citizens of Gaul, who would recognize in it Apollo's patronage of [[Augustus]] and the arts; and to Christians, who found solar monotheism less objectionable than the traditional pagan pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 310, a dispossessed and power-hungry Maximian rebelled against Constantine while Constantine was away campaigning against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with a contingent of Constantine's army, in preparation for any attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. He announced that Constantine was dead, and took up the imperial purple. In spite of a large donative pledge to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal to their emperor, and Maximian was soon compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and marched his army up the Rhine.&lt;ref name = &quot;yuhknp&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34–35; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 65–66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; At Cabillunum ([[Chalon-sur-Saône]]), he moved his troops onto waiting boats to row down the slow waters of the [[Saône]] to the quicker waters of the [[Rhone]]. He disembarked at [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian fled to Massilia ([[Marseille]]), a town better able to withstand a long siege than Arles. It made little difference, however, as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured and reproved for his crimes. Constantine granted some clemency, but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.&lt;ref name = &quot;yuhknp&quot;/&gt; 

In spite of the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 30.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40–41, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Maximian required a shift in Constantine's public image. He could no longer rely on his connection to the elder emperor Maximian, and needed a new source of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered in Gaul on 25 July 310, the orator reveals a previously unknown dynastic connection to [[Claudius II]], a third-century emperor famed for defeating the Goths and restoring order to the empire. Breaking away from tetrarchic models, the speech emphasizes Constantine's ancestral prerogative to rule, rather than principles of imperial equality. The new ideology expressed in the speech made Galerius and Maximian irrelevant to Constantine's right to rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7); Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 35–37, 301; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 66; Odahl, 94–95, 314–15; Potter, 352–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the orator emphasizes ancestry to the exclusion of all other factors: &quot;No chance agreement of men, nor some unexpected consequence of favor, made you emperor,&quot; the orator declares to Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7)1. Qtd. in Potter, 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oration also moves away from the religious ideology of the Tetrarchy, with its focus on twin dynasties of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Hercules]]. Instead, the orator proclaims that Constantine experienced a divine vision of [[Apollo]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] granting him [[laurel wreath]]s of health and a long reign. In the likeness of Apollo Constantine recognized himself as the saving figure to whom would be granted &quot;rule of the whole world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7).21.5.&lt;/ref&gt; as the poet Virgil had once foretold.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''[[Bucolics|Ecologues]]'' 4.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The oration's religious shift is paralleled by a similar shift in Constantine's coinage. In his early reign, the coinage of Constantine advertised [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] as his patron. From 310 on, Mars was replaced by [[Sol Invictus]], a god conventionally identified with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 67; Odahl, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little reason to believe that either the dynastic connection or the divine vision are anything other than fiction, but their proclamation strengthened Constantine's claims to legitimacy and increased his popularity among the citizens of Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 50–53; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 66–67; Odahl, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against Maxentius===
{{Campaignbox Constantine Wars}}

By the middle of 310 Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 31–35; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.16; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; His final act survives: a letter to the provincials posted in Nicomedia on 30 April 311, proclaiming an end to the persecutions, and the resumption of religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.17; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 304; Jones, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He died soon after the edict's proclamation,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43–44; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; destroying what little remained of the tetrarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximin mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor. A hasty peace was signed on a boat in the middle of the Bosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39–40; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; While Constantine toured Britain and Gaul, Maxentius prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; He fortified northern Italy, and strengthened his support in the Christian community by allowing it to elect a new [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], [[Pope Eusebius|Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxentius' rule was nevertheless insecure. His early support dissolved in the wake of heightened tax rates and depressed trade; riots broke out in Rome and [[Carthage]];&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37; Curran, 66; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 68; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domitius Alexander]] was able to briefly usurp his authority in Africa.&lt;ref name = &quot;leohak&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By 312, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; even among Christian Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38–39; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 311, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's &quot;murder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40; Curran, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent Maxentius from forming an alliance against him with Licinius,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine forged his own alliance with Licinius over the winter of 311–12, and offered him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximin considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44–45; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eusebius, inter-regional travel became impossible, and there was military buildup everywhere. There was &quot;not a place where people were not expecting the onset of hostilities every day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.15.1–2, qtd. and tr. in MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's advisers and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; even his soothsayers recommended against it, stating that the sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)2.5; Curran, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some to believe that he had some form of supernatural guidance,&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ignored all these cautions.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the spring of 312,&lt;ref name = &quot;esyyqc&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Odahl, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine crossed the [[Cottian Alps]] with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)5.1–3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The first town his army encountered was Segusium ([[Susa (TO)|Susa]], [[Italy]]), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy.&lt;ref name = &quot;esyyqc&quot;/&gt;

At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum ([[Turin]], Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Jones, 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 101–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing [[Battle of Turin (312)|battle]] Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)5–6; 4(10)21–24; Jones, 70–71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 102, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Jones, 71; Odahl, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312, when he moved on to [[Brixia]] ([[Brescia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41–42; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brescia's army was easily dispersed,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantine quickly advanced to [[Verona]], where a large Maxentian force was camped.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruricius Pompeianus, general of the Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the [[Adige]]. Constantine sent a small force north of the town in an attempt to cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruricius gave Constantine the slip and returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him.

Maxentius prepared for the same type of war he had waged against Severus and Galerius: he sat in Rome and prepared for a siege.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; Odahl, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; He still controlled Rome's praetorian guards, was well-stocked with African grain, and was surrounded on all sides by the seemingly impregnable [[Aurelian Walls]]. He ordered all bridges across the [[Tiber]] cut, reportedly on the counsel of the gods,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and left the rest of central Italy undefended; Constantine secured that region's support without challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine progressed slowly&lt;ref name=&quot;BCE42&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; along the ''[[Via Flaminia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 72; Odahl, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the weakness of Maxentius to draw his regime further into turmoil.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCE42&quot;/&gt; Maxentius' support continued to weaken: at chariot races on 27 October, the crowd openly taunted Maxentius, shouting that Constantine was invincible.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Curran, 67; Jones, 71–72; Odahl, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius, no longer certain that he would emerge from a siege victorious, built a temporary boat bridge across the Tiber in preparation for a field battle against Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42–43; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 312, the sixth anniversary of his reign, he approached the keepers of the [[Sibylline Books]] for guidance. The keepers prophesied that, on that very day, &quot;the enemy of the Romans&quot; would die. Maxentius advanced north to meet Constantine in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 44.8; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Curran, 67; Jones, 72; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxentius organized his forces—still twice the size of Constantine's—in long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river.&lt;ref name = &quot;bvubfs&quot;&gt;Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols on either its standards or its soldiers' shields.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Digeser, 122; Jones, 72; Odahl, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised &quot;to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers...by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its head bent round, he marked Christ on their shields.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 44.4–6, tr. J.L. Creed, ''Lactantius: De Mortibus Persecutorum'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), qtd. in Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, &quot;he saw with his own eyes in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying the message, ''In Hoc Signo Vinces'' or &quot;In this sign, you will conquer&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.28, tr. Odahl, 105. Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Drake, &quot;Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 113; Odahl, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the ''[[labarum]]'', for his army in that form.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.27–29; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43, 306; Odahl, 105–6, 319–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place,&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron and Hall, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius describes the sign as [[Chi (letter)|Chi]] (Χ) traversed by [[Rho (letter)|Rho]] (Ρ): ☧, a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word ''Christos'' or Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 306; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 73; Odahl, 319.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eusebian description of the vision has been explained as a type of solar halo called a &quot;[[Halo(optical phenomenon)|sun dog]]&quot;, a meteorological phenomenon which can produce similar effects.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 306; Cameron and Hall, 206–7; Drake, &quot;Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 114; Nicholson, 311.&lt;/ref&gt; In 315 a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the ''[[Chi Rho]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 71, citing ''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 7 Ticinum 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and coins issued at Siscia in 317/18 repeat the image.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ross Holloway, ''Constantine and Rome'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 3, citing Kraft, &quot;Das Silbermedaillon Constantins des Grosses mit dem Christusmonogram auf dem Helm,&quot; ''Jahrbuch für Numismatik und Geldgeschichte'' 5–6 (1954/55): 151–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raphael-Constantine at Milvian Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Battle of the Milvian Bridge (Giulio Romano)|The Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'' by [[Giulio Romano]]]]
Constantine deployed his own forces along the whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber where they were slaughtered and drowned.&lt;ref name = &quot;bvubfs&quot;/&gt; The battle was brief:&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Curran, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under the force of a Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 43; Curran, 68; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Rome===
Constantine entered Rome on 29 October.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 81; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He staged a grand ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' in the city, and was met with popular jubilation.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 93; Curran, 71–74; Odahl, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' body was fished out of the Tiber and decapitated. His head was paraded through the streets for all to see.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44; Curran, 72; Jones, 72; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 78; Odahl, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ceremonies, Maxentius' disembodied head was sent to [[Carthage]]; at this Carthage would offer no further resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his predecessors, Constantine neglected to make the trip to the [[Capitoline Hill]] and perform customary sacrifices at the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 81; Odahl, 111. Cf. also Curran, 72–75.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, choose to honor the [[Roman Senate|Senatorial]] [[Curia Julia|Curia]] with a visit,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45; Curran, 72; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 81; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; where he promised to restore its ancestral privileges and give it a secure role in his reformed government: there would be no revenge against Maxentius' supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45–46; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Senate decreed him &quot;title of the first name&quot;, which meant his name would be listed first in all official documents,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 46; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and acclaimed him as &quot;the greatest Augustus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He issued decrees returning property lost under Maxentius, recalling political exiles, and releasing Maxentius' imprisoned opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive propaganda campaign followed, during which Maxentius' image was systematically purged from all public places. Maxentius was written up as a &quot;[[tyrant]]&quot;, and set against an idealized image of the &quot;liberator&quot;, Constantine. Eusebius, in his later works, is the best representative of this strand of Constantinian propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45–47; Cameron, 93; Curran, 76–77; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' rescripts were declared invalid, and the honors Maxentius had granted to leaders of the Senate were invalidated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, CE, 45&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine also attempted to remove Maxentius' influence on Rome's urban landscape. All structures built by Maxentius were re-dedicated to Constantine, including the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano#History|Temple of Romulus]] and the [[Basilica of Maxentius]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; At the focal point of the basilica, a stone statue of Constantine holding the Christian ''labarum'' in its hand was erected. Its inscription bore the message the statue had already made clear: By this sign Constantine had freed Rome from the yoke of the tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:MMA bust 02.jpg|thumb|left|Colossal head of Constantine, from a seated statue: a youthful, classicising, other-worldly official image ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/eust/ho_26.229.htm Portrait Head of the Emperor Constantine, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 26.229 ]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Where he did not overwrite Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the [[Circus Maximus]] was redeveloped so that its total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the [[Via Appia]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the [[Praetorian Guard]] and Imperial Horse Guard (''equites singulares'') were disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45; Curran, 76; Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Their tombstones were ground up and put to use in a basilica on the [[Via Labicana]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 312, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;Krautheimer, ''Corpus Basilicarum Christianarum Romanorum'', 5.90, cited in Curran, 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legio II Parthica]] was removed from Alba ([[Albano Laziale]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, CE, 45&quot;/&gt; and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars against Licinius===
In the following years, Constantine gradually consolidated his military superiority over his rivals in the crumbling Tetrarchy. In 313, he met [[Licinius]] in [[Milan]] to secure their alliance by the marriage of Licinius and Constantine's half-sister [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]]. During this meeting, the emperors agreed on the so-called [[Edict of Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;The term is a misnomer as the act of Milan was not an edict, while the subsequent edicts by Licinius – of which the edicts to the provinces of Bythinia and Palestine are recorded by Lactantius and Eusebius, respectively – were not issued in Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;
officially granting full tolerance to Christianity and all religions in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
The document had special benefits for Christians, legalizing their religion and granting them restoration for all property seized during Diocletian's persecution. It repudiates past methods of religious coercion and used only general terms to refer to the divine sphere — &quot;Divinity&quot; and &quot;Supreme Divinity&quot;, ''summa divinitas''.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;Impact,&quot; 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;
The conference was cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximin had crossed the [[Bosporus]] and invaded European territory. Licinius departed and eventually defeated Maximin, gaining control over the entire eastern half of the Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt at the hands of a character that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 229&lt;/ref&gt;
in either 314 or 316 the two Augusti fought against one another at the [[Battle of Cibalae]], with Constantine being victorious. They clashed again at the [[Battle of Mardia]] in 317, and agreed to a settlement in which Constantine's sons [[Crispus]] and [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], and Licinius' son Licinianus were made [[Caesar (title)|''caesars'']].&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
After this arrangement, Constantine ruled the dioceses of Pannonia and Macedonia and took residence at [[Sirmium]], from whence he could wage war on the Goths and Sarmatians in 322, and on the Goths in 323.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the year 320, [[Licinius]] reneged on the religious freedom promised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and began to oppress Christians anew,&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;
generally without bloodshed, but resorting to confiscations and sacking of Christian office-holders.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 229/230&lt;/ref&gt;
That became a challenge to Constantine in the West, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. Licinius, aided by [[Goths|Goth]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], represented the past and the ancient [[Paganism|Pagan]] faiths. Constantine and his [[Franks]] marched under the standard of the ''[[labarum]]'', and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Supposedly outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious in the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]]. Licinius fled across the Bosphorus and appointed [[Martinianus|Martius Martinianus]], the commander of his bodyguard, as Caesar, but Constantine next won the [[Battle of the Hellespont]], and finally the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]] on 18 September 324.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Licinius and Martinianus surrendered to Constantine at Nicomedia on the promise their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, ''Chronicle of the Roman Emperors'', 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;macmullen&quot;&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later rule==
===Foundation of Constantinople===
[[File:Constantinopolis coin.jpg|thumb|right|Coin struck by Constantine I to commemorate the founding of Constantinople]]
Licinius' defeat came to represent the defeat of a rival center of Pagan and Greek-speaking political activity in the East, as opposed to the Christian and Latin-speaking Rome, and it was proposed that a new Eastern capital should represent the integration of the East into the Roman Empire as a whole, as a center of learning, prosperity, and cultural preservation for the whole of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] .&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Dagron, ''Naissance d'une Capitale'',  24&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine rebuilt the city of Byzantium, which was renamed ''Constantinopolis'' (&quot;Constantine's City&quot; or [[Constantinople]] in English), and issued special commemorative coins in 330 to honor the event. The new city was protected by the relics of the [[True Cross]], the [[Nehushtan|Rod of Moses]] and other holy [[relic]]s, though a cameo now at the [[Hermitage Museum]] also represented Constantine crowned by the [[tyche]] of the new city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagerooms.com/exhibitions/Byzantium/sardonyx.asp Sardonyx cameo depicting constantine the great crowned by Constantinople, 4th century AD] at &quot;The Road to Byzantium: Luxury Arts of Antiquity&quot;. ''The Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House'' (30 March 2006&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;3 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The figures of old gods were either replaced or assimilated into a framework of [[Christian symbolism]]. Constantine built the new [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] on the site of a temple to [[Aphrodite]]. Generations later there was the story that a [[Vision (religion)|Divine vision]] led Constantine to this spot, and an [[angel]] no one else could see, led him on a circuit of the new walls. The capital would often be compared to the 'old' Rome as ''Nova Roma Constantinopolitana'', the &quot;New Rome of Constantinople&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;macmullen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city &quot;New Rome&quot; (''Nova Roma'' or ''Nea Rhome''). Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (Michael Grant, ''The Climax of Rome'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1968), 133). It is possible that the emperor called the city &quot;Second Rome&quot; (''Deutera Rhome'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th century church historian Socrates of Constantinople.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious policy===

[[File:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|right|''Constantine the Great'', mosaic in [[Hagia Sophia]], c. 1000]]

Constantine is perhaps best known for being the first Christian Roman emperor; his reign was certainly a turning point for the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. In February 313, Constantine met with Licinius in Milan where they developed the [[Edict of Milan]]. The edict stated that Christians should be allowed to follow the faith of their choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Bowder, Diana. ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; This removed penalties for professing Christianity (under which many had been martyred in previous [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions of Christians]]) and returned confiscated [[Church (building)|Church]] property. The edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever [[deity]] they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by [[Galerius]], then senior emperor of the [[Tetrarchy]]; Galerius' edict granted Christians the right to practice their religion but did not restore any property to them.&lt;ref&gt;See Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians.

Scholars debate whether Constantine adopted his mother [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]]'s Christianity in his youth, or whether he adopted it gradually over the course of his life.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55. Also, Percival J. [http://cliojournal.wikispaces.com/On+the+Question+of+Constantine%27s+Conversion+to+Christianity On the Question of Constantine's Conversion to Christianity], Clio History Journal, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine would retain the title of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' until his death, a title emperors bore as heads of the pagan priesthood, as would his Christian successors on to [[Gratian]] (''r''. 375–83). According to Christian writers, Constantine was over 40 when he finally declared himself a Christian, writing to Christians to make clear that he believed he owed his successes to the protection of the Christian High God alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], ''The Rise of Christendom'' 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his rule, Constantine supported the Church financially, built basilicas, granted privileges to clergy (e.g. exemption from certain taxes), promoted Christians to high office, and returned property confiscated during the Diocletianic persecution.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous building projects include the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]].

Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone, however. After gaining victory in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the [[Arch of Constantine]]—was built (315) to celebrate it; the arch is decorated with images of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] and sacrifices to gods like [[Apollo]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], or [[Hercules]], but contains no Christian symbolism.

In 321, Constantine instructed that Christians and non-Christians should be united in observing the '''venerable day of the sun''', referencing the [[Sol Invictus|esoteric eastern sun-worship]] which [[Aurelian]] had helped introduce, and his coinage still carried the symbols of the sun cult until 324. Even after the pagan gods had disappeared from the coinage, Christian symbols appeared only as Constantine's ''personal'' attributes: the [[chi rho]] between his hands or on his [[labarum]], but never on the coin itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paul Veyne, ''Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Constantine dedicated the new capital of Constantinople, which became the seat of Byzantine Christianity for a millennium, he did so wearing the [[Apollo]]nian sun-rayed [[Diadem]].

[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|Constantine burning [[Arianism|Arian]] books]]

The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the emperor as having some influence within the religious discussions going on within the Catholic Church of that time, e.g., the dispute over [[Arianism]]. Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) 14–15; ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor saw it as his duty to ensure that God was properly worshiped in his empire, and that what proper worship consisted would be determined by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 316, Constantine acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the validity of [[Donatism]]. After deciding against the Donatists, Constantine led an army of Christians against the Donatist Christians. After 300 years of pacifism, this was the first intra-Christian persecution. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], effectively the first [[Ecumenical Council]] (unless the [[Council of Jerusalem]] is so classified).  Nicaea was dealt mostly with [[Arianism]]. Constantine also enforced the prohibition of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] against celebrating the Lord's Supper on the day before the Jewish [[Passover]] (14 ''[[Nisan]]'') (see [[Quartodecimanism]] and [[Easter controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm ''Life of Constantine'' Vol. III Ch. XVIII] by Eusebius; [http://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.iv.viii.i.x.html The Epistle of the Emperor Constantine, concerning the matters transacted at the council, addressed to those Bishops who were not present]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine made new laws regarding the [[Jews]]. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to [[brit milah|circumcise]] their slaves.

===Administrative reforms===
Beginning in the mid-3rd century the emperors began to favor members of the Equestrian Order over senators, who had had a monopoly on the most important offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 241&lt;/ref&gt;), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues - following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement. 

In 326, Constantine reversed this pro-equestrian trend, raising many administrative positions to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices to the old aristocracy, and at the same time elevating the rank of already existing equestrians office-holders to senator, eventually wiping out the equestrian order - at least as a bureaucratic rank&lt;ref&gt;As equestrian ''order'' refers to people of equestrian ''census'' - thousands of which had no state function - that had an actual position in the state bureaucracy: cf. Claude Lepelley, &quot;Fine delle' ordine equestre: le tappe delle'unificazione dela classe dirigente romana nel IV secolo&quot;, IN Giardina, ed., ''Società romana e impero tardoantico'', Bari: Laterza, 1986, V.1, quoted by Carrié &amp; Rouselle, p.660&lt;/ref&gt; - in the process. One could become a senator, either by being elected [[praetor]] or (in most cases) by fulfilling a function of senatorial rank:&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 247; Carrié &amp; Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 658.&lt;/ref&gt; from then on, holding of actual power and social status were melded together into a joint imperial hierarchy. At the same time, Constantine gained with this the support of the old nobility,&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 658–59.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Senate was allowed itself to elect praetors and [[quaestors]], in place of the usual practice of the emperors directly creating new magistrates (''adlectio''). In one inscription in honor of [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] (336–37) Ceionius Rufus Albinus, it was written that Constantine had restored the Senate &quot;the ''[[auctoritas]]'' it had lost at Caesar's time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01222&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1222]; Carrié &amp; Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 659.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Senate as a body remained devoid of any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 660.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arnhein, ''The Senatorial Aristocracy in the Later Roman Empire'', quoted by Perry Anderson, ''Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism'', 101.&lt;/ref&gt; however, such an interpretation remain conjectural, given the fact that we do not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu - some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, &quot;Statistics and the Conversion of the Roman Aristocracy&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 85,1995, quoted by Carrié &amp; Rousselle, p.657&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constantine's reforms had to do only with the civilian administration: the military chiefs, who since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] had risen from the ranks,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paul Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; remained outside the senate, in which they were included only by Constantine's children.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary reforms===
After the [[Crisis of the Third Century#Economic impact|runaway inflation of the third century]], associated with the production of [[fiat money]] to pay for public expenses, Diocletian had tried to reestablish trustworthy minting of silver and [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] coins. Constantine forsook this conservative monetary policy, preferring instead to concentrate on minting large quantities of good standard gold pieces—the [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], 72 of which made a pound of gold, the standard of silver and billon pieces being further degraded to assure the possibility of keeping fiduciary minting alongside a gold standard. The anonymous author of the possibly contemporary treatise on military affairs ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' held that, as a consequence of this monetary policy, the rift between classes widened: the rich benefited from the stability in purchasing power of the gold piece, while the poor had to cope with ever-degrading billon pieces.&lt;ref&gt;''De Rebus Bellicis'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later emperors like [[Julian the Apostate]] tried to present themselves as advocates of the ''humiles'' by insisting on trustworthy mintings of the copper currency.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Mazzarino, according to Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's monetary policy were closely associated with his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation - taken since 331 and closed in 336 - of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting ahold of the statues and having them melded for immediate minting - with the exception of a number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople&lt;ref&gt;Carrié &amp; Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executions of Crispus and Fausta===
On some date between 15 May and 17 June 326, Constantine had his eldest son [[Crispus]], by Minervina, seized and put to death by &quot;cold poison&quot; at Pola ([[Pula]], [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, 325–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Constantine had his wife, the Empress [[Fausta]], killed at the behest of his mother, Helena. Fausta was left to die in an over-heated bath.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, 326; Woods, &quot;Death of the Empress,&quot; 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Their names were wiped from the face of many inscriptions, references to their lives in the literary record were erased, and the memory of both was condemned. [[Eusebius]], for example, edited praise of Crispus out of later copies of his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', and his ''Vita Constantini'' contains no mention of Fausta or Crispus at all.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, 326; Woods, &quot;Death of the Empress,&quot; 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Few ancient sources are willing to discuss possible motives for the events; those few that do offer unconvincing rationales, are of later provenance, and are generally unreliable. At the time of the executions, it was commonly believed that the Empress Fausta was either in an illicit relationship with Crispus, or was spreading rumors to that effect. A popular myth arose, modified to allude to [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]–[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] legend, with the suggestion that Constantine killed Crispus and Fausta for their immoralities.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUTH326.7&quot;&gt;Guthrie, 326–27.&lt;/ref&gt; One source, the largely fictional ''Passion of Artemius'', probably penned in the eighth century by [[John of Damascus]], makes the legendary connection explicit.&lt;ref&gt;''Art. Pass'' 45; Woods, &quot;Death of the Empress,&quot; 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; As an interpretation of the executions, the myth rests on only &quot;the slimmest of evidence&quot;: sources that allude to the relationship between Crispus and Fausta are late and unreliable, and the modern suggestion that Constantine's &quot;godly&quot; edicts of 326 and the irregularities of Crispus are somehow connected rests on no evidence at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUTH326.7&quot;/&gt;

Although Constantine created his apparent heirs &quot;Caesars&quot;, following a pattern established by Diocletian, he gave his creations an hereditary character, alien to the tetrarchic system: Constantine's Caesars were to be kept in the hope of ascending to Empire, and entirely subordinated to their Augustus, as long as he was alive.&lt;ref&gt;Christol &amp; Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 237/238&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an alternative explanation for the execution of Crispus was, perhaps, Constantine's desire to keep a firm grip on his prospective heirs, this – and Fausta's desire for having her sons inheriting instead of their stepbrother – being reason enough for killing Crispus; the subsequent execution of Fausta, however, was probably meant as a reminder to her children that Constantine would not hesitate in &quot;killing his own relatives when he felt this was necessary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Adrian Goldsworthy, ''How Rome Fell'', 189 &amp; 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later campaigns===
[[File:ConstantineEmpire.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Roman Empire in 335 after Constantine's campaigns across the lower Danube.]]
Constantine considered Constantinople as his capital and permanent residence. He lived there for a good portion of his later life. He rebuilt Trajan's bridge across the Danube, in hopes of reconquering [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], a province that had been abandoned under Aurelian. In the late winter of 332, Constantine campaigned with the Sarmatians against the Goths. The weather and a lack of food did the Goths in; nearly one hundred thousand died before they submitted to Roman lordship. In 334, after Sarmatian commoners had overthrown their leaders, Constantine led a campaign against the tribe. He won a victory in the war and extended his control over the region, as remains of camps and fortifications in the region indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine resettled some Sarmatian exiles as farmers in the Balkans and Italy, and conscripted the rest into the army. Constantine took the title ''Dacicus maximus'' in 336.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years of his life Constantine made plans for a campaign against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''VC'' 4.9ff, cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent in the shape of a church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the [[Jordan River]] before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–7, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off however, when Constantine fell sick in the spring of 337.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 258–59. See also: Fowden, &quot;Last Days&quot;, 146–48, and Wiemer, 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sickness and death===
[[File:Constantinian Dynasty, the children of Constantine.png|thumb|The [[Constantinian dynasty]] down to [[Gratian]] (r. 367–383)]]
Constantine had known death would soon come. Within the Church of the Holy Apostles, Constantine had secretly prepared a final resting-place for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.58–60; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; It came sooner than he had expected. Soon after the Feast of Easter 337, Constantine fell seriously ill.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.61; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Constantinople for the hot baths near his mother's city of Helenopolis (Altinova), on the southern shores of the Gulf of İzmit. There, in a church his mother built in honor of Lucian the Apostle, he prayed, and there he realized that he was dying. Seeking purification, he became a [[catechumen]], and attempted a return to Constantinople, making it only as far as a suburb of Nicomedia.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.62.&lt;/ref&gt; He summoned the bishops, and told them of his hope to be baptized in the [[River Jordan]], where Christ was written to have been baptized. He requested the baptism right away, promising to live a more Christian life should he live through his illness. The bishops, Eusebius records, &quot;performed the sacred ceremonies according to custom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.62.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the Arianizing bishop [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], bishop of the [[Nicomedia|city]] where he lay dying, as his baptizer.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 75–76; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In postponing his baptism, he followed one custom at the time which postponed baptism until old age or death.&lt;ref&gt;Because he was so old, he could not be submerged in water to be baptised, and therefore, the rules of baptism were changed to what they are today, having water placed on the forehead alone. In this period infant baptism, though practiced (usually in circumstances of emergency) had not yet become a matter of routine in the west. Thomas M. Finn, ''Early Christian Baptism and the Catechumenate: East and West Syria'' (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press/Michael Glazier, 1992); Philip Rousseau, &quot;Baptism,&quot; in ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Post Classical World'', ed. G.W. Bowersock, Peter Brown, and Oleg Grabar (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought Constantine put off baptism as long as he did so as to be absolved from as much of his sin as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Marilena Amerise, 'Il battesimo di Costantino il Grande.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine died soon after at a suburban villa called Achyron, on the last day of the fifty-day festival of Pentecost directly following Easter, on 22 May 337.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.64; Fowden, &quot;Last Days of Constantine,&quot; 147; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Should check out R.W.

[[File:Raphael Baptism Constantine.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Baptism of Constantine]]'', as imagined by students of [[Raphael]]]]
Although Constantine's death follows the conclusion of the Persian campaign in Eusebius's account, most other sources report his death as occurring in its middle. Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], writing in the mid-350s, observes that the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]]s escaped punishment for their ill-deeds, because Constantine died &quot;in the middle of his preparations for war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Orations'' 1.18.b.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accounts are given in the ''Origo Constantini'', an anonymous document composed while Constantine was still living, and which has Constantine dying in Nicomedia;&lt;ref&gt;''Origo Constantini'' 35.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Historiae abbreviatae'' of Sextus Aurelius Victor, written in 361, which has Constantine dying at an estate near Nicomedia called Achyrona while marching against the Persians;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Aurelius Victor, ''Historiae abbreviatae'' XLI.16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Breviarium'' of Eutropius, a handbook compiled in 369 for the Emperor [[Valens]], which has Constantine dying in a nameless state villa in Nicomedia.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, ''Breviarium'' X.8.2.&lt;/ref&gt; From these and other accounts, some have concluded that Eusebius's ''Vita'' was edited to defend Constantine's reputation against what Eusebius saw as a less congenial version of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, &quot;Last Days of Constantine,&quot; 148–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his death, his body was transferred to Constantinople and buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]]. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews [[Dalmatius]] (who held the rank of Caesar) and [[Hannibalianus]], presumably to eliminate possible contenders to an already complicated succession. He also had two daughters, [[Constantina]] and [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], wife of [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]].&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 71, figure 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Although he earned his honorific of &quot;The Great&quot; (&quot;Μέγας&quot;) from Christian historians long after he had died, he could have claimed the title on his military achievements and victories alone. Besides reuniting the Empire under one emperor, Constantine won major victories over the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]] in 306–8, the Franks again in 313–14, the [[Visigoths]] in 332 and the [[Sarmatians]] in 334. By 336, Constantine had reoccupied most of the long-lost province of [[Dacia]], which [[Aurelian]] had been forced to abandon in 271. At the time of his death, he was planning a great expedition to end raids on the eastern provinces from the Persian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cultural sphere Constantine contributed to the revival of the clean shaven face fashion of the Roman emperors from [[Augustus]] to [[Trajan]], which was originally introduced among the Romans by [[Scipio Africanus]]. This new roman imperial fashion lasted until the reign of [[Phocas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y57GTvGsruYJ:www.moneymuseum.com/moneymuseum/library/coins/coin.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3D87FD8911C0B4A33013C52322A69564B8%3Faid%3D9%26ix%3D22%26i%3D5+Phocas+beard+fashion+emperor&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=sk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sk&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=www.google.sk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=Barba&lt;/ref&gt;

The Byzantine Empire considered Constantine its founder and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reckoned him among the venerable figures of its tradition. In the later Byzantine state, it had become a great honor for an emperor to be hailed as a &quot;new Constantine&quot;. Ten emperors, including the last emperor of Byzantium, carried the name.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental Constantinian forms were used at the court of [[Charlemagne]] to suggest that he was Constantine's successor and equal. Constantine acquired a mythic role as a warrior against &quot;heathens&quot;. The motif of the Romanesque equestrian, the mounted figure in the posture of a triumphant Roman emperor, became a visual metaphor in statuary in praise of local benefactors. The name &quot;Constantine&quot; itself enjoyed renewed popularity in western France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, 237–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Eastern Christian churches consider Constantine a saint (Άγιος Κωνσταντίνος, Saint Constantine).&lt;ref name=&quot;POHL83-87&quot;&gt;Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Byzantine Church he was called ''isapostolos'' (Ισαπόστολος Κωνσταντίνος)—an [[equal-to-apostles|equal of the Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, &quot;Constantine in Legendary Literature&quot; (CC), 305.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport|Niš airport]] is named Constantine the Great in honor of his birth in Naissus.

===Historiography===
During his life and those of his sons, Constantine was presented as a paragon of virtue. Even pagans like [[Praxagoras of Athens]] and [[Libanius]] showered him with praise. When the last of his sons died in 361, however, his nephew [[Julian the Apostate]] wrote the satire ''Symposium, or the Saturnalia'', which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 272–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Julian, [[Eunapius]] began—and [[Zosimus]] continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times, when the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was dominant, Catholic historians presented Constantine as an ideal ruler, the standard against which any king or emperor could be measured.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273; Odahl, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Renaissance]] rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources prompted a re-evaluation of Constantine's career. The German humanist Johann Löwenklau, discoverer of Zosimus' writings, published a Latin translation thereof in 1576. In its preface, he argued that Zosimus' picture of Constantine was superior to that offered by Eusebius and the Church historians, and damned Constantine as a tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Leunclavius, ''Apologia pro Zosimo adversus Evagrii, Nicephori Callisti et aliorum acerbas criminationes'' (''Defence of Zosimus against the Unjustified Charges of Evagrius, Nicephorus Callistus, and Others'') (Basel, 1576), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273, and Odahl, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]], a man of the [[Counter-Reformation]], criticized Zosimus, favoring Eusebius' account of the Constantinian era. Baronius' ''Life of Constantine'' (1588) presents Constantine as the model of a Christian prince.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar Baronius, ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' 3 (Antwerp, 1623), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274, and Odahl, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; For his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–89), [[Edward Gibbon]], aiming to unite the two extremes of Constantinian scholarship, offered a portrait of Constantine built on the contrasted narratives of Eusebius and Zosimus.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' Chapter 18, cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274, and Odahl, 282. See also Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In a form that parallels his account of the empire's decline, Gibbon presents a noble war hero corrupted by Christian influences, who transforms into an Oriental despot in his old age: &quot;a hero...degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', 1.256; David P. Jordan, &quot;Gibbon's 'Age of Constantine' and the Fall of Rome&quot;, ''History and Theory'' 8:1 (1969): 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interpretations of Constantine's rule begin with [[Jacob Burckhardt]]'s ''The Age of Constantine the Great'' (1853, rev. 1880). Burckhardt's Constantine is a scheming secularist, a politician who manipulates all parties in a quest to secure his own power.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Burckhardt, ''Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen'' (Basel, 1853; revised edition, Leipzig, 1880), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]], writing in the 1930s, followed Burckhardt's evaluation of Constantine. For Grégoire, Constantine only developed an interest in Christianity after witnessing its political usefulness. Grégoire was skeptical of the authenticity of Eusebius' ''Vita'', and postulated a pseudo-Eusebius to assume responsibility for the vision and conversion narratives of that work.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Seeck]], in ''Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt'' (1920–23), and André Piganiol, in ''L'empereur Constantin'' (1932), wrote against this historiographic tradition. Seeck presented Constantine as a sincere war hero, whose ambiguities were the product of his own naïve inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Piganiol's Constantine is a philosophical monotheist, a child of his era's religious syncretism.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Related histories by [[Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|A.H.M. Jones]] (''Constantine and the Conversion of Europe'' (1949)) and [[Ramsay MacMullen]] (''Constantine'' (1969)) gave portraits of a less visionary, and more impulsive, Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

These later accounts were more willing to present Constantine as a genuine convert to Christianity. Beginning with [[Norman H. Baynes]]' ''Constantine the Great and the Christian Church'' (1929) and reinforced by [[Andreas Alföldi]]'s ''The Conversion of Constantine and Pagan Rome'' (1948), a historiographic tradition developed which presented Constantine as a committed Christian. [[Timothy Barnes|T. D. Barnes]]'s seminal ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (1981) represents the culmination of this trend. Barnes' Constantine experienced a radical conversion, which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 8–9; Odahl, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Matson Odahl's recent ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004) takes much the same tack.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 283; Mark Humphries, &quot;Constantine,&quot; review of ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', by Charles Odahl, ''Classical Quarterly'' 56:2 (2006), 449.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Barnes' work, arguments over the strength and depth of Constantine's religious conversion continue.&lt;ref&gt;Averil Cameron, &quot;Introduction,&quot; in ''Constantine: History, Historiography, and Legend'', ed. Samuel N.C. Lieu and [[Dominic Montserrat]] (New York: Routledge, 1998), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain themes in this school reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott's ''The Christianity of Constantine the Great'' (1996), which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar view of Constantine is held in [[Paul Veyne]]'s recent (2007) work, ''Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien'', which does not speculate on the origins of Constantine's Christian motivation, but presents him, in his role as Emperor, as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed himself meant &quot;to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6404/is_2_69/ai_n29437350/?tag=content;col1 Quand notre monde est devenu chretien], Fabian E. Udoh, review, ''Theological Studies'', June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation of Constantine===
{{main|Donation of Constantine}}
[[Latin Rite]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] considered it inappropriate that Constantine was baptized only on his death-bed and by a bishop of questionable orthodoxy, viewing it as a snub to the authority of the Papacy. Hence, by the early fourth century, a legend had emerged that [[Pope Sylvester I]] (314–35) had cured the pagan emperor from [[leprosy]]. According to this legend, Constantine was soon baptized, and began the construction of a church in the [[Lateran Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, &quot;Constantine in Legendary Literature&quot; (CC), 298–301.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth century, most likely during the pontificate of [[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II]] (752–7), a document called the [[Donation of Constantine]] first appeared, in which the freshly converted Constantine hands the temporal rule over &quot;the city of [[Rome]] and all the provinces, districts, and cities of [[Italy]] and the Western regions&quot; to Sylvester and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitutum Constantini'' 17, qtd. in Lieu, &quot;Constantine in Legendary Literature&quot; (CC), 301–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[High Middle Ages]], this document was used and accepted as the basis for the Pope's [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], though it was denounced as a forgery by Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, &quot;The 'Donation of Constantine'&quot;. ''The English Historical Review'' 10: 37 (1895), 86–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and lamented as the root of papal worldliness by the poet [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'' 19.115; ''Paradisio'' 20.55; cf. ''De Monarchia'' 3.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th century philologist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved the document was indeed a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Fubini, 79–86; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia''===
Because of his fame and his being proclaimed Emperor in the territory of [[Roman Britain]], later [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] regarded Constantine as a king of their own people. In the 12th century [[Henry of Huntingdon]] included a passage in his ''Historia Anglorum'' that Constantine's mother Helena was a Briton, the daughter of [[King Cole]] of [[Colchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry of Huntingdon, ''Historia Anglorum'', Book I, ch. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] expanded this story in his highly fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', and account of the supposed [[list of legendary kings of Britain|Kings of Britain]] from their [[Troy|Trojan]] origins to the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenway&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Greenway|first1= Diana (Ed.) |coauthors= Henry of Huntingdon|title= Historia Anglorum: The History of the English People|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1996|month= |isbn= 0198222246|page=civ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Geoffrey, Cole was King of the Britons when Constantius, here a senator, came to Britain. Afraid of the Romans, Cole submitted to Roman law so long as he retained his kingship. However, he died only a month later, and Constantius took the throne himself, marrying Cole's daughter Helena. They had their son Constantine, who succeeded his father as King of Britain before becoming Roman Emperor.

Historically, this series of events is extremely improbable. Constantius had already left Helena by the time he left for Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriage&quot;/&gt; Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though it may have been a lost hagiography of Helena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenway&quot;/&gt;

==Constantine in popular culture==
Constantine was played by [[Cornel Wilde]] in the 1962 film ''[[Constantine and the Cross]]''.

He is also slated to be portrayed by [[Robert Vincent Jones]] in the upcoming film ''[[Nicholas of Myra (film)|Nicholas of Myra]]''.

''Constantine: The Miracle of the Flaming Cross'' is a romanticised, novelised account of Constantine's life written by American author [[Frank G. Slaughter]] and published in 1965. It largely drew on [[Edward Gibbon]]'s history of the Roman Empire as well as [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s contemporary account, as indicated in the afterword of the original edition&lt;ref&gt;Frank G. Slaughter, ''Constantine: The Miracle of the Flaming Cross'', Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{distinguish|Command-line Interface}}

The '''Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)''' is an open [[specification]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and standardized by ISO&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42927&lt;/ref&gt; and ECMA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that describes the executable code and runtime environment that form the core of the Microsoft [[.NET Framework]] and the [[free and open source software|free and open source]] implementations [[Mono (software)|Mono]] and [[Portable.NET]]. The specification defines an environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures.

==Overview==
[[Image:Overview of the Common Language Infrastructure.svg|thumb|280px|Visual overview of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]]
Among other things, the CLI specification describes the following four aspects:-

; The [[Common Type System]] (CTS) : A set of [[data type]]s and operations that are shared by all CTS-compliant [[programming language]]s.
; [[.NET_metadata|Metadata]] : Information about program structure is language-agnostic, so that it can be referenced between languages and tools, making it easy to work with code written in a language you are not using.
; Common Language Specification (CLS) : A set of base rules to which any language targeting the CLI should conform in order to interoperate with other CLS-compliant languages. The CLS rules define a subset of the Common Type System.
; [[Virtual Execution System]] (VES) : The VES loads and executes CLI-compatible programs, using the metadata to combine separately generated pieces of code at runtime.

All compatible languages compile to [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), which is an [[intermediate language]] that is abstracted from the platform hardware.  When the code is executed, the platform-specific VES will compile the CIL to the [[machine language]] according to the specific hardware and operating system.

== Standardization and licensing ==
In August 2000, [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Intel]], and others worked to standardize CLI.  By December 2001, it was ratified by the [[Ecma International|ECMA]], with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standardization following in April 2003.

Microsoft and its partners hold patents for CLI.  ECMA and ISO require that all patents essential to implementation be made available under &quot;[[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms]]&quot;, but interpretation{{who|date=January 2011}} of this has led to much controversy, particularly in the case of Mono {{fact|date=January 2011}}.

As of July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://port25.technet.com/archive/2009/07/06/the-ecma-c-and-cli-standards.aspx
| title=The ECMA C# and CLI Standards - Port 25: The Open Source Community at Microsoft
| date=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] applied [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and CLI under the [http://www.microsoft.com/interop/cp/default.mspx Community Promise], so anyone can safely implement those standards without fearing a patent lawsuit.

== Support for dynamic languages ==
{{main|List of CLI languages}}
{{See|.NET Framework#.NET Framework 4}}
The Common Language Infrastructure currently has no built-in support for [[Type system#Dynamic typing|Dynamically typed languages]] because the existing [[Common Intermediate Language]] is [[Type system#Static typing|statically typed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://blogs.msdn.com/joelpob/archive/2005/07/01/434728.aspx
| title=CLR Dynamic languages under the hood
| date=2007-01-03
|last=Pobar|first=Joel
| accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dynamic Language Runtime]] is an ongoing effort to bring this support to the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]].

== Implementations ==
* The [[.NET Framework]] is built on the [[Common Language Runtime]], Microsoft's commercial implementation of the CLI for desktop and server systems, and also encompasses a large collection of programming frameworks and libraries.
* [[Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure]] is a reference implementation of the CLI available from Microsoft, under the [[Shared source]] licensing program.
* [[.NET Compact Framework]] is Microsoft's commercial implementation of the CLI for portable devices and [[Xbox 360]].
* [[Microsoft Silverlight]], an implementation for use in web browsers - for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]].
* [[Mono (software)|Mono development platform]] is an [[open source]] implementation of CLI and accompanying technologies, sponsored by [[Novell]].
* [[Portable.NET]], part of the [[dotGNU]] project, is a [[Free Software]] implementation of ECMA-335 by [[Free Software Foundation]].
* [[VMKit]] part of [[Low Level Virtual Machine]] toolkit as of version 2.3. Implements very incomplete and alpha stage support of a [[Virtual Execution System]]. It is based on [[DotGNU]], [[Portable.NET]] corelib and class libraries.

The '''ICC Cricket World Cup''' is the premier international championship of men's [[One Day International]] (ODI) [[cricket]]. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament which is held every four years. The tournament is the world's fourth-largest and fourth-most-viewed sporting event.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;3rd&quot;/&gt; According to the ICC, it is the most important tournament and the pinnacle of achievement in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cricket World Cup marketing overview|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/icc-marketing.html|author=[[International Cricket Council]]|publisher=Cricket World Cup 2007|accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cricket World Cup overview|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/pdfs/icc.pdf|author=[[International Cricket Council]]|publisher=Cricket World Cup 2007|format= PDF|accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Cricket World Cup contest was organised in England in 1975. A separate [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] has been held every four years since 1973.

The finals of the Cricket World Cup are contested by all ten [[Test cricket|Test]]-playing and [[One Day International#Teams with ODI status|ODI-playing]] nations, together with other nations that qualify through the [[Cricket World Cup Qualifier|World Cup Qualifier]]. [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] has been the most successful of the five teams to have won the tournament, taking four titles. The [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Indian cricket team|India]] have won twice, while [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] have each won once.

The [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]] started on 19 February 2011 and commenced on 2 April 2011. The tournament was co-hosted by [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and [[Sri Lanka]] with the participation of 14 countries. [[Indian cricket team|India]] won the cup by defeating [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] by 6 wickets in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], thus becoming the first team to win a world cup final on home soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/engine/match/433606.html|title=Final: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai, Apr 2, 2011 |publisher= ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 2011, at least one team from the [[Indian subcontinent]] has reached the World Cup final, Pakistan (winner) in 1992, Sri Lanka (winner) in 1996, Pakistan (runner up) in 1999, India (runner up) in 2003, Sri Lanka (runner up) in 2007, India (winner) and Sri Lanka (runner up) in 2011.

==History==
{{main|History of the Cricket World Cup}}

===Before the first Cricket World Cup===
The [[United States v Canada (1844)|first ever international cricket match]] was played between Canada and the United States, on the 24 and 25 September 1844. However, the first credited [[Test cricket|Test match]] was played in 1877 between [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[English cricket team|England]], and the two teams competed regularly for [[The Ashes]] in subsequent years. [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] was admitted to Test status in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/australia/content/match/62396.html|publisher=cricinfo.com|date=1877-03-15|title= 1st Test Scorecard|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative cricket teams were selected to [[International structure of cricket|tour]] each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Games]], where [[Great Britain and Ireland at the 1900 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] defeated [[France at the 1900 Summer Olympics|France]] to win the [[Gold medal#Olympic Games|gold medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900/OLYMP/GREAT-BRIT_FRANCE_OLYMP_FINAL_19-20AUG1900.html|publisher=cricinfo.com|date=1900-08-19|title= Olympic Games, 1900, Final|accessdate=2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only appearance of cricket at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]].

The first multilateral competition at international level was the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a &quot;surfeit of cricket&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/207248.html|publisher=cricinfo.com|title= The original damp squib|date=2005-04-23|accessdate=2006-08-29| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016161938/http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/207248.html| archivedate = October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the quadrangular [[Asian Test Championship]] in 1999.

The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over the years, with the addition of [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1928, [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1930, [[Indian cricket team|India]] in 1932, and [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in 1952, but international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.

In the early 1960s, English [[county cricket]] teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in [[1962 English cricket season|1962]] with a four-team [[single-elimination tournament|knockout competition]] known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/208335.html|publisher=cricinfo.com|date=2005-04-30|title= The birth of the one-day game|accessdate=2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing with the inaugural [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] in [[1963 English cricket season|1963]], [[Limited overs cricket|one-day cricket]] grew in popularity in England. A national [[National League (cricket)|Sunday League]] was formed in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]]. The first One-Day International event was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at [[Melbourne]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1970-71|1971]], to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty [[over (cricket)|over]] match with eight balls per over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newicc.cricket.org/icc/odi/what_is_one-day_cricket.html|publisher=newicc.cricket.org|title= What is One-Day International cricket?|accessdate=2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/264535.html|publisher=cricinfo.com|title= The World Cup - A brief history|accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1975 ICC Cricket World Cup|inaugural Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at that time. The 1975 tournament started on June 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENGHOST&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricworld.com/news/wchistory03feb.htm|publisher=cricworld.com|title= The History of World Cup's|accessdate=2006-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors [[Prudential plc]]. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing [[cricket clothing and equipment|cricket whites]] and using red [[cricket ball]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], Pakistan, and the [[West Indies]] (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from [[East African cricket team|East Africa]].&lt;ref name=cricket&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; One notable omission was [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], who were banned from international cricket due to [[apartheid]]. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in the final at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]].&lt;ref name=cricket/&gt;

The [[1979 ICC Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]] saw the introduction of the [[ICC Trophy]] competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,&lt;ref name=&quot;ICCTROPHY&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/ICCT2005/ARTICLES/history.html|publisher=cricinfo.com|title= ICC Trophy - A brief history|accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sri Lanka and [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] qualifying.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 32–35&lt;/ref&gt; West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts, England, by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The [[1983 ICC Cricket World Cup|1983 event]] was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this time, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]] qualified through the ICC Trophy. A [[Fielding restrictions (cricket)|fielding circle]] was introduced, {{convert|30|yd|m}} away from the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]]. Four [[fielding (cricket)|fieldsmen]] needed to be inside it at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], an outsider quoted at 66-1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 105–110&lt;/ref&gt;

===1987–1996===
The [[1987 ICC Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]], named the [[Reliance World Cup]] after their Indian sponsors, was held in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the [[Indian subcontinent]] compared with England's summer.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 111–116&lt;/ref&gt; Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 155–159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cworldcup/history.htm|publisher=A.Srinivas|title=Cricket World Cup 2003|accessdate=2007-01-28|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/cworldcup/history.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+18:00:35|archivedate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1992 ICC Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, [[Day/Night ODI|day/night]] matches, and an alteration to the fielding restrictions. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports [[boycott]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan overcame a dismal start to emerge as winners, defeating England by 22 runs in the final.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 211–214&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1996 ICC Cricket World Cup|1996 championship]] was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at [[Eden Gardens]] ([[Kolkata|Calcutta]]) after their hosts lost eight [[wicket]]s while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 254, were awarded victory by default after riots broke out in protest against the Indian performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketfundas.com/wc96indslsf1march13.html|publisher=cricketfundas|title=1996 Semi-final scoreboard|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final, which was held in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 264–274&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian treble===
In 1999 the [[1999 ICC Cricket World Cup|event]] was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1350&amp;part=index&amp;refpage=|publisher=nrich.maths|title=1999 Cricket World Cup|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final (also against South Africa) where a mix-up between South African [[batsman|batsmen]] [[Lance Klusener]] and [[Allan Donald]] saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be [[run out]]. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs, with eight wickets in hand.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 232–238&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Australian World Cup treble.jpg|thumb|200px|A large crowd of over 10,000 fans welcome the Australian team on completing the first World Cup [[Hat-trick#Cricket|hat-trick]] - Martin Place, Sydney.]]
South Africa, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Kenya]] hosted the [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]]'s victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others &amp;mdash; and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns &amp;mdash; enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate. In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUS2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2875100/2875135.stm |publisher=bbc.co.uk|title=Ruthless Aussies lift World Cup|date=2003-03-23 |accessdate=2007-01-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Full tournament schedule |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/fixturesresults/default.stm |publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2003-03-23 | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia defeated [[Sri Lanka]] in the final by 53 runs (D/L), in farcical light conditions, extending their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight World Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/292773.html|publisher=Cricinfo|title=Australia v Sri Lanka, World Cup final, Barbados|date=2007-04-28|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
===Qualification===
{{main|Cricket World Cup qualification}}
The Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event, while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. The One Day International playing nations automatically enter the final qualification tournament, the World Cup Qualifier, along with other nations who have qualified through separate competitions.

Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|second World Cup]], where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the [[ICC Trophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICCTROPHY&quot;/&gt; The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy has varied throughout the years; currently, six teams are selected for the Cricket World Cup. The [[World Cricket League]] (administered by the [[International Cricket Council]]) is the qualification system provided to allow the [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate]] and [[List of International Cricket Council members#Affiliate Members|Affiliate]] members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify.The name &quot;ICC Trophy&quot; has been changed to &quot;ICC World Cup Qualifier&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/development/wcl/|publisher=ICC|title=World Cricket League|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all 91 Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.

===Tournament===
{{see also|History of the Cricket World Cup#Historical formats of final tournament}}
[[Image:ICC CWC 2007 team captains.jpg|thumb|200px|The captains of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.]]
The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_1975.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=1st tournament|accessdate=2007-02-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217093647/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_1975.html| archivedate = December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, competition comprised two stages, a group stage and a [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With the return of South Africa in 1992 after the ending of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199192.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=92 tournament|accessdate=2007-02-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217093653/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199192.html |archivedate = December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199596.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=96 tournament|accessdate=2007-02-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217093658/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199596.html| archivedate = December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.

A new format was used for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]] and [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]] World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the '''Super 6'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;super6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC99/WC99_TABLE.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=Super 6|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Super 6&quot; teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;super6&quot;/&gt; The top four teams from the &quot;Super 6&quot; stage progressed to the semi-finals, with winners playing in the final.

The last format used in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], features 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/TeamGroupings.html|publisher=cricket world cup|title=World Cup groups|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each group, the teams play each other in a round-robin format. Teams earn points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group move forward to the '''Super 8''' round. The &quot;Super 8&quot; teams play the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carrying their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the &quot;Super 8&quot; stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/pdfs/event-overview.pdf|publisher=cricketworldcup.com|title= About the Event|accessdate=2006-09-02|pages=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top four teams from the &quot;Super 8&quot; round advance to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals play in the final.

The current format, approved by ICC to be used in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]], features 14 teams allocated. Within each group, the teams will play in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each group will proceed to the knock out stage playing quarter-finals. Winners of the quarter-finals will play semi-finals and the winning semi-finalists will play in the final.

==Trophy==
[[Image:Cricket World Cup trophy 2.png|thumb|100px|The Cricket World Cup trophy which is kept by the ICC.]]{{main|Cricket World Cup Trophy}}
The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup finals. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history; prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://robots.cnnsi.com/cricket/1999/world_cup/news/1999/06/20/wc_trophy/ |publisher=cnnsi.com|title=Trophy is first permanent prize in game's history|accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--is this right? were there different Prudential Cups, or was the same Cup used three times? --&gt; The trophy was designed and produced in [[London]] by a team of craftsmen from [[Garrard &amp; Co]] over a period of two months.

The current trophy is made from [[silver]] and [[gilding|gild]], and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] and [[bail (cricket)|bails]], represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: [[batting (cricket)|batting]], [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]], while the globe characterises a [[cricket ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.webindia123.com/Sports/cricket/iccworldcup/history.htm |publisher=webindia123.com|title=Cricket World Cup- Past Glimpses|accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands 60&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] high and weighs approximately 11&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram]]s. The names of the previous winners are [[engraving|engraved]] on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions.

The original trophy is kept by the ICC. A replica, which differs only in the inscriptions, is permanently awarded to the winning team.

Successive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, ''Dazzler'' the [[zebra]]. An orange [[raccoon]]-like creature known as ''Mello'' was the [[mascot]] for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. ''[[Stumpy]]'', a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-02/top-stories/28320620_1_mascot-world-cup-elephant|title=2011 World Cup mascot named as 'Stumpy'|publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|accessdate=2011-04-16|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection of hosts==
[[Image:Civic Centre-2003 CWC.jpg|thumb|Civic Centre, South Africa honours the 2003 World Cup.]]{{main|Cricket World Cup hosts}}
The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/245789.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=Asia to host 2011 World Cup|date=2006-04-30|accessdate=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENGHOST&quot;/&gt; India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members believed England to be a more suitable venue because the longer period of daylight in England in June&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cricket-world-cup-2007.cricket.deepthi.com/world-cup-cricket-1979.html|publisher=cricket.beepthi|title= World Cup Cricket 1979|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant that a match could be completed in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC79_HISTORY.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title= The 1979 World Cup in England - West Indies retain their title|accessdate= 2006-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1987 Cricket World Cup]] was the first hosted outside England, held in Pakistan and India.

Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as [[South Asia]] in 1987, 1996 and 2011, [[Australasia]] in 1992, [[Southern Africa]] in 2003 and [[West Indies]] in 2007.

==Performances by Teams==
[[Image:Cricket World Cup best results.png|thumb|left|Map of each nation's best results]]
Nineteen nations have qualified for the finals of the Cricket World Cup at least once (excluding qualification tournaments). Seven teams have competed in every finals tournament, five of which have won the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; The [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] won the first two tournaments, and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] has won four, [[India national cricket team|India]] has won two, while [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] have each won once. The West Indies ([[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]] and [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]]) and Australia ([[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]], [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]]) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; Australia has played in 6 of the 9 final matches (1975, [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]], [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]], 1999, 2003, 2007) including the finals in the four most recent tournaments. [[England national cricket team|England]] has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]]). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt;

Sri Lanka, who co-hosted the 1996 Cricket World Cup, was the first host to win the tournament, though the final was held in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; India won the 2011 as host and was the first team to win in a final played in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/3506378/India-have-finally Dhon-it.html|title=We've finally Dhon it|publisher=The Sun|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries which have achieved or equaled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand, semi-finalists in 1992; Zimbabwe, reaching the Super Six in 2003; and Kenya, semi-finalists in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by Australia and England respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt;

===Man of the Match in the World Cup Final===
Previously, there was no tournament award, although [[man of the match|Man of the Match]] awards have always been given for individual matches. Winning the Man of the Match in the final is logically noteworthy, as this indicates the player deemed to have played the biggest part in the World Cup final. To date the award has always gone to a member of the winning side. The Man of the Match award in the final of the competition has been awarded to:&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting''', abbreviated to '''CHOGM''', is a [[wiktionary:Biennial|biennial]] [[summit meeting]] of the [[Head of government|heads of government]] from all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations.  Every two years the meeting is held in a different member state, and is chaired by that nation's respective [[Prime Minister]] or [[President]], who becomes the [[Commonwealth Chairperson-in-Office]].  Recently, meetings have been attended by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], who is the [[Head of the Commonwealth]], although the Queen's formal appearance only began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Ingram (journalist) |year=2004 |month=January |title=Abuja Notebook |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=373 |pages=7–10 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1080/0035853042000188157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|first CHOGM]] was held in 1971, and there have been twenty-one held in total: the most recent [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2009|in Trinidad and Tobago in 2009]].  They are held once every two years, although this pattern has twice been interrupted.  They are held around the Commonwealth, rotating by invitation amongst its members.

In the past, CHOGMs have attempted to orchestrate common policies on certain contentious issues and current events, with a special focus on issues affecting member nations.  CHOGMs have discussed the continuation of [[apartheid]] rule in [[South Africa]] and how to end it, military [[coup]]s in [[Pakistan]] and [[Fiji]], and allegations of electoral fraud in [[Zimbabwe]].  Sometimes the member states agree on a common idea or solution, and release a joint statement declaring their opinion.  More recently, beginning at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997|1997 CHOGM]], the meeting has had an official 'theme', set by the host nation, on which the primary discussions have been focused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Diary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Ingram (journalist) |year=1998 |month=January |title=Edinburgh Diary |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=87 |issue=345 |pages=13–16 |url= |accessdate=2008-12-20 |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358539808454395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The heads of government of five members of the Commonwealth of Nations at the 1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.]]
The meetings originated with the  of the leaders of the self-governing colonies of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mole |first=Stuart |year=2004 |month=September |title=Seminars for statesmen': the evolution of the Commonwealth summit  |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=376 |pages=533–546 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1080/0035853042000289128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[First Colonial Conference]] in 1887 was followed by periodic meetings, known as [[Imperial Conference]]s from 1911, of government leaders of the Empire.  The development of the independence of the [[dominion]]s, and the creation of a number of new dominions, as well as the invitation of [[Southern Rhodesia]] (which also attended as a ''sui generis'' colony),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watts |first=Carl P. |year=2007 |month=July |title=Dilemmas of Intra-Commonwealth Representation during the Rhodesian Problem, 1964-65 |journal=Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=323–44 |url= |accessdate=2008-12-20 |quote= |doi=10.1080/14662040701516904  }}&lt;/ref&gt; changed the nature of the meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot; /&gt;  As the dominion leaders asserted themselves more and more at the meetings, it became clear that the time for 'imperial' conferences was over.

From the ashes of the [[World War II|Second World War]], seventeen [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]s were held between 1944 and 1969.  Of these, sixteen were held in [[London]], reflecting then-prevailing views of the Commonwealth as the continuation of the Empire and the centralisation of power in the British [[Commonwealth Office]] (the one meeting outside London, in [[Lagos]], was an extraordinary meeting held in January 1966 to coordinate policies towards [[Rhodesia]]).  Two supplementary meetings were also held during this period: a Commonwealth Statesmen's meeting to discuss peace terms in April 1945, and a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952.

The 1960s saw an overhaul of the Commonwealth.  The swift expansion of the Commonwealth after [[decolonization|decolonisation]] saw the newly-independent countries demand the creation of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], and the [[United Kingdom]], in response, successfully founding the [[Commonwealth Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/40203725 |last=McIntyre |first=W. David |authorlink=W. David McIntyre |year=1998 |month=October |title=Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat |url=http://jstor.org/stable/40203725 |journal=International Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=753–777 |id= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decentralisation of power demanded a reformulation of the meetings.  Instead of the meetings always being held in London, they would rotate across the membership, subject to countries' ability to host the meetings: beginning with [[Singapore]] [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|in 1971]].  They were also renamed the 'Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings' to reflect the growing diversity of the constitutional structures in the Commonwealth.

==Structure==

The core of the CHOGM are the executive sessions, which are the formal gatherings of the heads of government to do business.  However, the majority of the important decisions are held not in the main meetings themselves, but at the informal '[[retreat]]s': introduced at [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1973|the second CHOGM]], in [[Ottawa]], by [[Canadian Prime Minister|Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty Commonwealth steps&quot; /&gt; but reminiscent of the excursions to [[Chequers]] or [[Dorneywood]] in the days of the Prime Ministers' Conferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot; /&gt;  The rules are very strict: allowing the head of the delegation, his or her spouse, and one other person.  The additional member can be of any capacity (personal, political, security, etc), but he or she has only occasional and intermittent access to the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot; /&gt;  It is usually at the retreat where, isolated from their advisers, the heads resolve the most intransigent issues: leading to the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, the [[Lusaka Declaration]] in 1979, the [[Langkawi Declaration]] in 1989, the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme|Millbrook Programme]] in 1995, and the [[Aso Rock Declaration]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot; /&gt;

The 'fringe' of [[civil society]] organisations, including the [[Commonwealth Family]] and local groups, adds a cultural dimension to the event, and brings the CHOGM a higher media profile and greater acceptance by the local population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty Commonwealth steps&quot; /&gt;  First officially recognised at [[Limassol]] in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot; /&gt; these events, spanning a longer period than the meeting itself, have, to an extent, preserved the length of the CHOGM: but only in the cultural sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty Commonwealth steps&quot; /&gt;  Other meetings, such as those of the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]], [[Commonwealth Business Council]], and respective [[foreign minister]]s, have also dealt with business away from the heads of government themselves.

As the scope of the CHOGM has expanded beyond the meetings of the heads of governments themselves, the CHOGMs have become progressively shorter, and their business more compacted into less time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty Commonwealth steps&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Ingram (journalist) |year=2007 |month=October |title=Twenty Commonwealth steps from Singapore to Kampala |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=96 |issue=392 |pages=555–563 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530701625877 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|1971 CHOGM]] lasted for nine days, and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977|1977]] and [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1991|1991 CHOGMs]] for seven days each.  However, Harare's epochal CHOGM was the last to last a week; the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1993|1993 CHOGM]] lasted for five days, and the contentious [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1995|1995 CHOGM]] for only three-and-a-half, setting a precedent that has lasted since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seminars for Statesmen&quot; /&gt;

==Agenda==
Under the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], each CHOGM is responsible for renewing the remit of the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]], whose responsibility it is to uphold the [[Harare Declaration]] on the core political principles of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/34458/the_millbrook_commonwealth_action_programme/ |title=The Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme on the Harare Declaration, 1995 |accessdate=2007-07-22 |date=1995-11-12 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satire==

[[Carol Thatcher]] quotes the Australian press as suggesting that CHOGM stood for &quot;Coons holidaying on government money&quot;.{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Below the Parapet - The Biography of Denis Thatcher&quot; &gt;{{cite book |title=Below the Parapet - The Biography of Denis Thatcher |first=Carol |last=Thatcher |authorlink=Carol Thatcher |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s former aides, and as broadcast in the 1994 PBS video, &quot;The Windsors:  A Royal Family,&quot; Mrs. Thatcher, very privately, used to say that CHOGM stood for Compulsory Handouts to Greedy Mendicants.&lt;ref&gt;PBS Video, &quot;The Windsors:  A Royal Family&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
As the convocation of heads of governments and permanent Commonwealth staff and experts, CHOGMs are the highest institution of action in the Commonwealth, and rare occasions on which Commonwealth leaders all come together.  CHOGMs have been the venues of many of the Commonwealth's most dramatic events.  [[Robert Mugabe]] announced [[Zimbabwe]]'s immediate withdrawal from the Commonwealth at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003|2003 CHOGM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |year=2004 |month=January |title=Editorial: CHOGM 2003, Abuja, Nigeria |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=373 |pages=3–6 |url= |accessdate=2008-12-20 |quote= |doi=10.1080/0035853042000188139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nigeria]]'s execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] and eight others on the first day of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1995|1995 CHOGM]] led to that country's suspension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty Commonwealth steps&quot; /&gt;

It has also been the trigger of a number of events that have shook participating countries domestically.  The departure of [[President of Uganda|Uganda's President]] [[Milton Obote]] to the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|1971 CHOGM]] allowed [[Idi Amin]] to overthrow Obote's government.  Similarly, [[President of Seychelles|President]] [[James Mancham]]'s attendance of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977|1977 CHOGM]] gave [[Prime Minister of Seychelles|Prime Minister]] [[France-Albert René]] the opportunity to seize power in the [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty Commonwealth steps&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Contains Chinese text}}
'''Chinese classic texts''', or '''Chinese canonical texts''', ({{zh|c=典籍|p=diǎnjí}}) today often refer to the pre-[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] Chinese texts, especially the Neo-Confucian titles of ''[[Four Books and Five Classics]]'' (四書五經), a selection of short books and chapters from the voluminous collection called the ''[[Thirteen Classics]]''. All of these pre-Qin texts were written in [[classical Chinese]]. As canons they are collectively referred to as ''jing'' (經).

More broadly speaking, Chinese classic texts may refer to texts, be they written in [[vernacular Chinese]] or in classical Chinese, that existed before 1912, when the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the [[Qing Dynasty]], fell. These can include ''shi'' (史, historical works), ''zi'' (子, philosophical works belonging to schools of thought other than the Confucian, but also works of agriculture, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, divination, art criticism, and all sorts of miscellaneous writings) and ''ji'' (集, literary works) as well as ''jing''.

In the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and Qing dynasties, the ''Four Books and Five Classics'', Chinese classical texts chosen by the [[Neo-Confucian]] scholar [[Zhu Xi]] of [[Southern Song Dynasty]], were the subject of mandatory study by those [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars who wished to become government officials. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]], or even a military officer, without knowing them. Generally, children first studied the [[Chinese characters]] with rote memorization of the ''[[Three Character Classic]]'' and ''[[Hundred Family Surnames]]'', then went on to memorize the other classics, in order to ascend in the social hierarchy.

Scholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|&quot;Qin Fire&quot;]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Burning of books and burying of scholars]]&lt;/ref&gt; when many of the original texts, especially those of [[Confucianism]], were burned in a political [[purge]].

==Before 221 BCE==
*The Classics of [[Confucianism]]
** The [[Four Books]]
*** The ''[[Great Learning]]'' is a chapter from the ''Classic of Rites''.
*** The ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' is another chapter from the ''Classic of Rites''.
*** The ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'', a twenty-chapter work of dialogues between Confucius and his disciples, recorded by later Confucian scholars.
*** The ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', a book of conversations between [[Mencius]] and some kings of his time.
**The [[Five Classics]]
*** The ''[[I Ching]]'' is a manual of divination based on the eight [[trigram]]s attributed to the mythical figure [[Fuxi]] (by the time of Confucius these eight trigrams had been multiplied to sixty-four [[hexagram]]s). The ''I Ching'' is still used by modern adherents of folk religion.
*** The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' is made up of 305 poems divided into 160 folk songs, 74 minor festal songs, traditionally sung at court festivities, 31 major festal songs, sung at more solemn court ceremonies, and 40 hymns and eulogies, sung at sacrifices to gods and ancestral spirits of the royal house. This book is traditionally credited as a compilation from Confucius.

A '''call centre''' or '''call center'''&lt;ref&gt;see [[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|spelling differences]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by [[telephone]]. A call centre is operated by a [[company]] to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for [[telemarketing]], clientele, product services, and debt collection are also made. In addition to a call centre, collective handling of [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[fax]]es, [[live chat]], and [[e-mails]] at one location is known as a '''contact centre'''.

A call center is often operated through an extensive open workspace for [[Customer representative|call centre agents]], with work stations that include a computer for each agent, a [[telephone]] set/[[Headphones|headset]] connected to a [[telecom switch]], and one or more supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate [[computer network]], including [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[microcomputer]]s and [[local area network|LANs]]. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI).

Most major businesses use call centres to interact with their customers. Examples include utility companies, mail order catalogue retailers, and customer support for computer hardware and software. Some businesses even service internal functions through call centres. Examples of this include help desks, retail financial support, and sales support.[[File:Call centre desk lakeland florida.jpg|thumb|A typical call center worker's desk environment in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland, Florida, United States]].]]

A '''contact centre''', also known as customer interaction centre is a central point of any organization from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company’s customer relationship management (CRM). Today, customers contact companies by calling, emailing, chatting online, visiting websites, faxing, and even instant messaging.[[File:Callcentreterminal.JPG|thumb|Call centre worker at a very small workstation/booth, using [[CallWeb]], an internet based survey software.]]

==Technology==
Call centre technology is subject to improvements and innovations. Some of these technologies include [[speech recognition]] software to allow computers to handle first level of [[customer support]], [[text mining]] and [[natural language processing]] to allow better customer handling, agent training by automatic mining of [[best practices]] from past interactions, [[support automation]] and many other technologies to improve agent productivity and [[customer satisfaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lvs004.googlepages.com/callcenters.pdf|author=L Venkata Subramaniam|format=PDF|title=Call Centers of the Future|publisher=i.t. magazine|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-05-29|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7035699/description.html|title=US Patent 7035699 - Qualified and targeted lead selection and delivery system|date=2006-04-25|publisher=Patent Storm|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; both for inbound and outbound campaigns, whereby inbound calls are intended to quickly land with the appropriate agent to handle the task, whilst minimizing wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in, as well as for outbound calls, where lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors and past performance and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.
The concept of the [[Universal Queue]] standardizes the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email whilst the concept of a [[Virtual queue]] provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.[[File:Aspect Tel-set telephone call centre.jpg|thumb|A typical call centre telephone. Note: no handset, phone is for headset use only.]]

'''Premise-based Call Centre Technology'''
Historically, call centres have been built on [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] equipment that is owned and hosted by the call centre operator. The PBX might provide functions such as [[Automatic Call Distribution]], [[Interactive Voice Response]], and [[skills-based routing]]. The call centre operator would be responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and necessary software upgrades as released by the vendor.

'''Virtual Call Centre Technology'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/kapq5p85xnhrwe5b/|author=M. Popovic and V. Kovacevic|title=An Approach to Internet-Based Virtual Call Center Implementation|publisher=University of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the advent of the [[Software as a service]] technology delivery model, the virtual call centre has emerged. In a virtual call centre model, the call centres operator does not own, operate or host the equipment that the call centre runs on. Instead, they subscribe to a service for a monthly or annual fee with a service provider that hosts the call centre telephony equipment in their own data centre. Such a vendor may host many call centres on their equipment. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional [[PSTN]] telephone lines, or over [[Voice over IP]]. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premise. The vendor's telephony equipment then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.

Virtual Call Centre Technology allows people to work from home, instead of in a traditional, centralized, call centre location, which increasingly allows people with physical or other disabilities that prevent them from leaving the house, to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nticentral.org/about/articles/nnyt03012006.shtm|author=David S. Joachim|title=Computer Technology Opens a World of Work to Disabled People |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Predictive dialer end campaign prompt.jpg|thumb|A predictive dialing system running out of numbers to dial.]]

'''Cloud Computing for Call Centres'''
Cloud computing for call centres extends cloud computing to [[Software as a service]], or hosted, on-demand call centres by providing application programming interfaces (APIs) on the call centre cloud computing platform that allow call centre functionality to be integrated with cloud-based [[Customer relationship management]], such as [[Salesforce.com]] and leads management and other applications.

The APIs typically provide programmatic access to two key groups of features in the call centre platform:

Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) APIs provide developers with access to basic telephony controls and sophisticated call handling on the call centre platform from a separate application.

Configuration APIs provide programmatic control of administrative functions of the call centre platform which are typically accessed by a human administrator through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Patents ==
[[File:Telemarketoffice.jpg|thumb|Call centre floor during shift.]]
There is a large number of [[patent]]s covering various aspects of call centre operation, automation, and technology.  One of the early inventors in this field, [[Ronald A. Katz]], personally holds over 40 patents covering inventions related to charge-free numbers, automated attendant, automated call distribution, voice response unit, computer telephone integration and speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.findlaw.com/2004/Jun/9/133461.html |title=Bednarek et al., &quot;Katz Patent Reexamination: A Change in Momentum Favoring RAKTL Targets&quot;, ShawPittman, June 9, 2004 |publisher=Library.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eis report2.jpg|thumb|A report on the performance of an outbound call centre agent.]]
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Report.png|thumb| Customizable reports to measure call results at call centre, campaign and agent levels {{deletable image-caption|Saturday, December 18, 2010|date=December 2010}}]] --&gt;

== Dynamics ==

Types of calls are often divided into ''outbound'' and ''inbound''.  Inbound calls are calls that are made by the consumer to obtain information, report a malfunction, or ask for help. These calls are substantially different from outbound calls, where agents place calls to potential customers mostly with intentions of selling or service to the individual. ''(See [[telemarketing]])''. It is possible to combine inbound and outbound campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3700/is_199611/ai_n8743570|title=Setting up for integrated inbound/outbound telemarketing|publisher=[[BNET]]|author=Freeman, Laura M|coauthors=Whitfield, Hilary C|accessdate=2008-06-05 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Call centre staff are often organised into a multi-tier support system for a more efficient handling of calls.  The first tier in such a model consists of operators, who direct inquiries to the appropriate department and provide general directory information. If a caller requires more assistance, the call is forwarded to the second tier, where most issues can be resolved. In some cases, there may be three or more tiers of support staff. If a caller requires more assistance, the caller is forwarded to the third tier of support; typically the third tier of support is formed by product engineers/developers or highly skilled technical support staff of the product. 

Call centres have their critics, some of which argue that the work atmosphere in such an environment is de-humanising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/2005/04/SE0504NU02.htm|title=Working conditions and health in Swedish call centres|publisher=[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]]|date=2005-04-28|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to the low rates of pay and restrictive working practices of some employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Call_Center/Hourly_Rate|title=Hourly Rate Survey Report for Industry: Call Center|publisher=[[PayScale]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/94-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Advice regarding call centre working practices|publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much controversy over such things as restricting the amount of time that an employee can spend in the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/toiletbreaks/index.htm|title=Hazards 81 extended briefing: Toilet breaks: Give us a break!|publisher=[[Hazards]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, call centres have been the subject of complaints by callers who find the staff often do not have enough skill or authority to resolve problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=873|title=Tone-deaf to customer complaints, Dell opens yet another call center in India|date=2006-01-30|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|author=Shaw, Russell|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the dehumanised workers very often exhibit an attitude of apathy.ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4738804.stm|title=Abuse rattles Indian call centre staff|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-02-22|author=Ahmed, Zubair|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the highly technological nature of the operations in such offices, the close monitoring of staff activities is easy and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callcentrehelper.com/call_centre_monitoring.htm|title=Call Centre Monitoring|work=Management|publisher=callcentrehelper.com|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be argued to be beneficial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callcentermagazine.com/shared/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=12803684|title=The Call Center Answer Team reaches out to the industry for to crack a tough nut|work=Q&amp;A: How Many Calls Should I Monitor|publisher=callcentermagazine.com|date=2003-07-30|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable the company to better plan the workload and time of its employees. Some people have argued that such close monitoring breaches human rights to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acewh.dal.ca/eng/reports/moving6.pdf|format=PDF|title=Who’s on the Line? Women in Call Centres Project|publisher=[[Health Canada]]|work=Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Women's Health|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
Some variations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6z7661eJIjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|author=Raik Stolletz|title=Performance Analysis and Optimization of Inbound Call Centers|publisher=Springer-Verlag | isbn=9783540008125|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; of call centre models are listed below: 

*''Contact centre'' – Supports interaction with customers over a variety of media, including but not necessarily limited to [[telephony]],  [[e-mail]] and internet [[Online chat|chat]].
*''Inbound call centre'' - Exclusively or predominantly handles inbound calls (calls initiated by the customer).
*''Outbound call centre'' - One in which call centre agents make outbound calls to customers or sales leads.
*''Blended call centre'' - Combining automatic call distribution for incoming calls with predictive dialling for outbound calls, it makes more efficient use of agent time as each type of agent (inbound or outbound) can handle the overflow of the other.

== Criticism and performance ==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2010}}
Criticisms of call centres generally follow a number of common themes, from both callers and call centre staff. From callers, common criticisms include:&lt;ref&gt;Ali, S.  2006 &quot;If you want to scream, press...&quot;  Wall Street Journal http://online.wsj.com/google_login.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116171027921802238.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operators working from a script
* Non-expert operators (call screening)
* Incompetent or untrained operators incapable of processing customers' requests effectively&lt;ref&gt;Adsit, D. (2007) Do Call Centers Need to Carry Malpractice Insurance? ''In Queue'', http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol2no24.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overseas location, with language and accent problems
* Touch tone menu systems and automated queuing systems
* Excessive waiting times to be connected to an operator
* Complaints that departments of companies do not engage in communication with one another
* Deceit over location of call centre (such as allocating overseas workers false English names)
* Requiring the caller to repeat the same information multiple times

Common criticisms from staff include:&lt;ref&gt;P Taylor, P Bain [http://extranet.ieseg.fr/appli/creasites2/sites/ORB522E/Taylor%20and%20Bain.pdf &quot;'An assembly line in the head': work and employee relations in the call centre&quot;] Industrial Relations Journal, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Close scrutiny by management (e.g. frequent random call monitoring)
* Low compensation (pay and bonuses)
* Restrictive working practices (some operators are required to follow a pre-written script)
* High stress: a common problem associated with front-end jobs where employees deal directly with customers
* Repetitive job task
* Poor working conditions (e.g. poor facilities, poor maintenance and cleaning, cramped working conditions, management interference, lack of privacy and noisy)
* Impaired vision and hearing problems
* Rude and abusive customers
The net-net of these concerns is that call centres as a business process exhibit levels of variability. The experience a customer gets and the results a company achieves on a given call are almost totally dependent on the quality of the agent answering that call.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J., Coffman, C., Harter, J. (2005) Manage Your Human Sigma, Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt; Call centres are beginning to address this by using agent-assisted voice solutions to standardise the process all agents use.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, S.

== Outsourced bureau contact centres ==
Outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a &quot;pay per use&quot; model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients thereby supporting a very cost effecive model especially for low volumes of calls.

Bureau contact centres provide an opportunity for:
* Pilot schemes - perform test of concept for new models for communications, sales or customer services before investing in staff and infrastructure
* Flexible solutions for SME's - small or medium-size enterprises can benefit from a flexible service that can evolve with the businss
* Best of breed systems/technology - clients can benefit from considerable investment into communications technology, leveraging benefits without having to invest in large cap-ex projects.

{{Islam}}

The '''Caliph''' ({{lang-ar|خليفة}} / ḫalīfa / khalīfa) is the [[head of state]] in a [[Caliphate]], and the title for the ruler of the [[Islam]]ic ''[[Ummah]]'', an Islamic community ruled by the [[Shari'ah]]. It is a transcribed version of the [[Arabic]] word {{Audio|Ar-khalifa.ogg|خليفة '''Khalīfah'''}} &amp;nbsp; which means &quot;successor&quot; or &quot;representative&quot;. Following [[Muhammad|Muhammad's]] death in 632, the early leaders of the Muslim nation were called &quot;Khalifat Rasul Allah&quot;, the political successors to the messenger of God (referring to Muhammad). Some academics prefer to transliterate the term as ''Khalīfah''.

Caliphs were often also referred to as ''[[Amir al-Mu'minin|Amīr al-Mu'minīn]]'' (أمير المؤمنين) &quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot;, ''Imam al-[[Ummah]]'', ''Imam al-Mu'minīn'' (إمام المؤمنين), or more colloquially, leader of the [[Muslim]]s.  After the first four caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]], and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]), the title was claimed by the [[Umayyads]], the [[Abbasids]], the [[Fatimids]], and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], and at times, by competing dynasties in [[Spain]], [[Northern Africa]], and [[Egypt]]. Most historical Muslim governors were called [[sultan]]s or [[emir]]s, and gave allegiance to a caliph, but this caliph at times had very little real authority. The title has been defunct since the [[Republic of Turkey]] abolished the [[Ottoman Caliphate]] in 1924, although some individuals and groups have called for its restoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Jay Tolson, &quot;Caliph Wanted: Why An Old Islamic Institution Resonates With Many Muslims Today,&quot; ''U.S News &amp; World Report'' 144.1 (January 14, 2008): 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], [[Sharif of Mecca]] and [[Kingdom of Hejaz|King of Hejaz]], claimed the title [[Sharifian Caliphate|briefly in 1924]], and the [[Imams of Yemen]] had been using the title for centuries and continued to use the title until 1962.)

==Succession to Muhammad==
{{Main|Succession to Muhammad}}

In his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), [[Fred Donner]] argues that the standard Arabian practice at the time was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves. There was no specified procedure for this [[shura]] or consultation. Candidates were usually, but not necessarily, from the same lineage as the deceased leader. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual heir.

[[Sunni]] Muslims believe and confirm that Muhammad's father-in-law [[Abu Bakr]] was chosen by the community and that this was the proper procedure. Sunnis further argue that a caliph should ideally be chosen by election or community consensus.

[[Shi'a]] Muslims believe that Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of Muhammad, should have replaced Muhammad as Caliph and that Caliphs were to assume authority through genetic lineage.  

A third branch of Islam, the [[Ibadi]] [[Kharijite]]s, believes that the caliphate rightly belongs to the greatest spiritual leader among Muslims, regardless of his lineage. They are currently an extremely small sect, found mainly in [[Oman]].

==Word Usage==

Caliph is translated from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''Khalifa''' (خليفة {{unicode|ẖalīfä}}) meaning &quot;[[successor]]&quot;, &quot;[[wiktionary:substitute|substitute]]&quot;, or &quot;[[lieutenant]]&quot;. It is used in the [[Qur'an]] to establish [[Islamic view of Adam|Adam's]] role as representative of [[Allah]] on earth. Kalifa is also used to describe the belief that man's role, in his real nature, is as khalifa or viceroy to Allah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1262 From the article &quot;Khalifah&quot; in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also most commonly used for the Islamic leader of the [[Ummah]]; starting with [[Muhammad]] and his line of successors.

The precise meaning of Khalifa is &quot;representative&quot;. The first four Caliphs: [[Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr as-Siddiq]], [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]], [[Usman ibn Affan]], and [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] are commonly known by Sunnis, mainly, as the ''[[Khulfa-e-Rashideen]]'' (&quot;rightly guided successors&quot;) Caliphs. Each Caliph was a close companion of Muhammad during his prophethood.

==History==
===Succession and Recognition===

[[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] Muslims differ on the legitimacy of the reigns of the ''Khulfa-e-Rashideen'', the first four Caliphs. The Sunnis follow the Caliphates of all four, while the Shi'ites recognize only the Caliphate of Ali and the short Caliphate of his son Hasan. This schism occurred following the death of [[Muhammad]].

According to Sunni beliefs, [[Muhammad]] gave no specific directions as to the choosing of his successor when he died. At this time there were two customary means of selecting a leader: having a hereditary leader for general purposes, and choosing someone with good qualities in times of crisis or opportunities for action.

While Sunni and Shia Islam differ sharply on the conduct of a caliph and the right relations between a leader and a community, they do not differ on the underlying theory of stewardship. Both abhor waste of [[natural resources]] in particular to show off or demonstrate power.

In the initial stages the latter way of choosing leadership prevailed among the leading companions of Muhammad. [[Abu Bakr]] was elected as the first caliph or successor to Muhammad, with the other companions of Muhammad giving an oath of allegiance to him. Those opposing this method thought that [[Ali]], Muhammad's nearest relative, should have succeeded him. However the appointment of the next two caliphs varied from the election of Abu Bakr. On his deathbed, Abu Bakr appointed [[Umar]] as his successor without an election by the community of Believers. The oath, approving the appointment of Umar, was taken only by the Companions present in Medina at the time. This led to certain groups disputing the authority of Umar. Umar also altered the way his successor would be found. Before he was assassinated, Umar decided that his successor would come from a group of six. This group included Ali and [[Uthman Ibn Affan|Uthman]] another companion of Muhammad. These six would have to establish from among themselves Umar's successor. Ultimately Uthman was chosen as Umar successor, becoming the third Caliph. After the assassination of Uthman, Ali was elected as the fourth Caliph.

===Ali's Caliphate and the Rise of the Ummayyad Dynasty===

Ali's reign as Caliph was plagued by great turmoil and internal strife. Ali was faced with multiple rebellions and insurrections. The primary one coming from [[Mu'awiyah]] a relative of Uthman and Governor of [[Damascus]]. Mu'awiyah attacked Ali at the [[Battle of Siffin]]. The battle lasted several months resulting in a stalemate. In order to avoid further bloodshed, Ali agreed to negotiate with Mu'waiyah. This caused a faction of some 4,000 strict traditionalists, known as [[Kharijites]] (&quot;Seceders&quot;), to abandon the fight. After defeating the Kharijites at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]], Ali would later be assassinated by the Kharijite Ibn Muljam. Ali's son Hasan was elected as the fifth Caliph only to concede his title to Mu'awiyah a few months later. Mu'awiyah became the sixth Caliph, establishing the Ummayyad Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam. Cyril Glasse. pp. 39-41,318-319, 353-354&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Umayyad}} Umayyads===

{{Main|Umayyad Caliphate}}

[[File:Age-of-caliphs.png|thumb|200px|The expansion of the caliphate under the Umayyads. {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under Muhammad, 622-632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the Patriarchal Caliphate, 632-661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661-750}}]]
Under the Umayyads, the [[Muslim empire]] grew rapidly. To the West, Muslim rule expanded across [[North Africa]] and into [[Spain]]. To the East, it expanded through [[Iran]] and ultimately to [[India]]. This made it one of the largest empires in the history of [[West Eurasia]], extending its entire breadth.

However, the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within Islam itself. Some Muslims supported prominent early Muslims like [[Zubayr ibn al-Awwam|az-Zubayr]]; others felt that only members of Muhammad's clan, the Banū Hashim, or his own lineage, the descendants of {{Unicode| ʻAlī}}, should rule.  There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks (notably, the rivalry between Yaman and Qays). Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hisham and Alid claims united to bring down the Umayyads in 750. However, the ''{{Unicode| Shiʻat ʻAlī}}'', &quot;the Party of {{Unicode| ʻAlī}}&quot;, were again disappointed when the [[Abbasid]] dynasty took power, as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] and not from {{Unicode| ʻAlī}}. Following this disappointment, the {{Unicode| Shiʻat ʻAlī}} finally split from the majority Sunni Muslims and formed what are today the several {{Unicode| Shiʻa}} denominations.

===Abbasids===

[[File:Abbasids Dynasty 750 - 1258 (AD).PNG|thumb|right|200px|Map of the Abbasid Caliphate at its greatest extent]]

{{Main|Abbasid Caliphate}}

The Abbasids would provide an unbroken line of caliphs for over three centuries, consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating great intellectual and cultural developments in the Middle East. But by 940 the power of the caliphate under the Abbasids was waning as non-Arabs, particularly the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] (and later the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in Egypt in the latter half of the 13th century), gained influence, and sultans and emirs became increasingly independent. However, the caliphate endured as both a symbolic position and a unifying entity for the Islamic world.

During the period of the Abbasid dynasty, Abbasid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged. The {{Unicode| Shiʻa}} [[Said ibn Husayn]] of the [[Fatimid]] dynasty, which claimed descendancy of Muhammad through his daughter, claimed the title of Caliph in 909, creating a separate line of caliphs in [[North Africa]]. Initially covering Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years, taking [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine]], before the Abbasid dynasty was able to turn the tide, limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt. The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171. The Umayyad dynasty, which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of [[Spain]], reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929, lasting until it was overthrown in 1031.

===Fatimids===

[[File:Fatimid Islamic Caliphate.png|thumb|right|Map of the Fatimid Caliphate also showing cities.]]

{{Main|Fatimid Caliphate}}

The Fatimid Caliphate or al-Fātimiyyūn (Arabic الفاطميون) was an Berber Shi'a dynasty that ruled over varying areas of the Maghreb, Egypt, Sicily, Malta and the Levant from 5 January 909 to 1171. The caliphate was ruled by the Fatimids, who established the Egyptian city of Cairo as their capital. The term Fatimite is sometimes used to refer to the citizens of this caliphate. The ruling elite of the state belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shi'ism. The leaders of the dynasty were also Shia Ismaili Imams, hence, they had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims. They are also part of the chain of holders of the office of Caliph, as recognized by most Muslims. Therefore, this constitutes a rare period in history in which some form of the Shia Imamate and the Caliphate were united to any degree, excepting the Caliphate of Ali himself. The Fatimids, however, are not recognized and counted by all Sunnis as a caliphate.

With exceptions, the Fatimids were reputed to exercise a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Ismaili sects of Islam as well as towards Jews, Maltese Christians and Coptic Christians.[1]

===Shadow Caliphate===

1258 saw the conquest of [[Baghdad]] and the execution of Abassid caliph [[al-Musta'sim]] by [[Mongol]] forces under [[Hulagu Khan]]. A surviving member of the Abbasid House was installed as Caliph at [[Cairo]] under the patronage of the [[Mamluk]] [[Sultanate]] three years later. However, the authority of this line of Caliphs was confined to ceremonial and religious matters, and later Muslim historians referred to it as a &quot;shadow&quot; caliphate.

===Ottomans===

{{Main|Ottoman Caliphate}}

As the [[Ottoman Empire]] grew in size and strength, Ottoman rulers beginning with [[Mehmed II]] began to claim caliphal authority. Their claim was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most [[Arab]] lands. The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo, [[al-Mutawakkil III]], was taken into custody and was transported to [[Istanbul]], where he surrendered the Caliphate to [[Selim I]].

Ottoman rulers were known primarily by the title of Sultan.[[File:Ottoman 1683.png|200px|thumb|The Ottoman Caliphate.]]

According to Barthold, the first time the title of caliph was used as a political instead of symbolic religious title by the Ottomans was the peace treaty with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1774. The outcome of this war was disastrous for the Ottomans. Large territories, including those with large Muslim populations such as [[Crimea]], were lost to the Christian Russian Empire.  However, the Ottomans under [[Abdulhamid I]] claimed a diplomatic victory, the recognition of themselves as protectors of Muslims in Russia as part of the peace treaty. This was the first time the Ottoman caliph was acknowledged as having political significance outside of Ottoman borders by a European power. As a consequence of this diplomatic victory, as the Ottoman borders were shrinking, the powers of the Ottoman caliph increased.

Around 1880 Sultan Abdulhamid II reasserted the title as a way of countering creeping European colonialism in Muslim lands. His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of British India. By the eve of the [[World War I|First World War]], the Ottoman state, despite its weakness vis-à-vis Europe, represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity.  But the sultan also enjoyed some authority beyond the borders of his shrinking empire as caliph of Muslims in Egypt, India and Central Asia.

===Abolition of the institution===

{{Main|Turkish War of Independence|Atatürk's Reforms}}

On 3 March 1924, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]], on the initiative of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], dissolved the institution of the Caliphate, transferring its powers to the Turkish Grand National Assembly. Although it is widely believed that the Caliphate has been abolished, this is not the case. The powers have been vested in the Turkish Parliament, which in turn has delegated its authority to various Turkish government institutions. Shall the Republic of Turkey decide to reinstate the caliphate, it has the legislative power and also the religious authority to do so. The religious authority is derived from its possession of the Islamic relics. These Islamic Relics are housed in the [[Topkapi Palace]] compound and housed in specially designed bomb proof vaults. 

Occasional demonstrations have been held calling for the reestablishment of the Caliphate.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==Titular uses==
===Religious leaders===

* In 19th century Sudan, [[Mohammed Ahmed]] &quot;the [[Mahdi]]&quot; was succeeded by [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]] &quot;the Khalifa&quot;.
* In the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect, ''[[khalifatul Masih]]'' is the title of the successors of its founding [[Messiah]], except in the break-away Lahore branch, which is led by its own Emirs.

===Secular offices===

In [[Morocco]], the Sherifian Monarch awarded the title ''Khalifa'' or ''Chaliphe'', here meaning '[[Viceroy]]', to royal princes (styled [[Moulay]]), including future Sultans, who represented the crown in a part of the sultanate:
* especially in the former royal capitals [[Marrakesh]], [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Meknes]]
* also in other mayor cities, e.g. in [[Shawiya]], [[Casablanca]], [[Tafilalt]], [[Tadla]], [[Tiznit]]  [[Tindouf]], in the valley of the [[Draa River]] and in [[Tetouan]].
* but also, in the 20th century, as irrevocably fully mandated Representative of the Sultan in the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Zone]], known after him in Spanish as ''el Jalifato'' (note the definite article; although the Spanish word can also be applied to other deputies of various Moroccan officials), besides the ''[[Alto comisario]]'' (de facto governing 'High Commissioner') of the colonial 'protector' Spain, which called his office ''el Jalifa'' (not ''Califa'', the word for any 'imperial' Caliph, ruling a ''[[caliphate|califato]]''):
:* 19 April 1913 - 9 November 1923  [[Mulay]] al-Mahdi bin Isma'il bin Muhammad (d. 1923)
:* 9 November 1923 - 9 November 1925  Vacant
:* 9 November 1925 - 16 March 1941  Mulay Hassan bin al-Mahdi (1st time) (born 1912)
:* 16 March 1941 - October 1945  Vacant
:* October 1945 - 7 April 1956   Mulay Hassan bin al-Mahdi (2nd time)

==Other uses==

Khalifa can have a definition, be a first name, or family or tribe name. Like many titles, Khalifa also occurs in many names.

It is the family name of the [[Al Khalifa]] dynasty, rulers of the peninsular Arab nation of [[Bahrain]], who are descended from the [[Bani Utub]] tribe.

==Authority of the successor==

The question of who should succeed Muhammad was not the only issue that faced the early Muslims; they also had to clarify the extent of the leader's powers. Muhammad, during his lifetime, was not only the Muslim political leader, but the Islamic prophet. All law and spiritual practice proceeded from Muhammad. Nobody claimed that his successor would be a prophet; succession referred to political authority. The uncertainty centered on the extent of that authority. Muhammad's revelations, directly from God, were soon codified and written down as the [[Qur'an]], which was accepted as a supreme authority, limiting what a caliph could legitimately command.

However, there is some evidence that some early caliphs did believe that they had authority to rule in matters not specified in the Qur'an. They believed themselves to be temporal and spiritual leaders even in issues not commanded in the Quran, and insisted that implicit obedience to the caliph in all things not contradicting the Quran, was the hallmark of the good Muslim. The modern scholars [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Martin Hinds]], in their book ''God's Caliph'', outline the evidence for an early, expansive view of the caliph's importance and authority. They argue that this view of the caliph was eventually nullified (in Sunni Islam, at least) by the rising power of the [[ulema]], or Islamic lawyers, judges, scholars, and religious specialists. The ulema insisted on their right to determine what was legal and orthodox. The proper Muslim leader, in the ulema's opinion, was the leader who enforced the rulings of the ulema, rather than making rulings of his own, unless he himself was qualified in [[Islamic law]]. Conflict between caliph and ulema, akin to a modern judiciary, was a recurring theme in early Islamic history, and ended in the victory of the ulema. The caliph was henceforth limited to temporal rule only. He would be considered a righteous caliph if he were guided by the ulema. Crone and Hinds argue that Shi'a Muslims, with their expansive view of the powers of the [[imamate]], have preserved some of the beliefs of the early [[Ummayad]] dynasty which ironically, they despise. Crone and Hinds' thesis is not accepted by some scholars.

Most Sunni Muslims now believe that the caliph has always been a merely temporal ruler, and that the ulema has always been responsible for adjudicating orthodoxy and Islamic law ([[shari'a]]). The first four caliphs are called the [[Rashidun]], the Rightly Guided Caliphs, because they are believed to have followed the Qur'an and the way or [[sunnah]] of Muhammad in all things. This formulation itself presumes the Sunni ulema's view historically.

==Al-Ghazali on the desired character traits for administration==

[[Al Ghazali]] wrote the &quot;Nasihat al-Muluk&quot; or &quot;Advice for Kings&quot; to a [[Seljuq]] [[Sultan]] in which he gave ten different ethics of royal administration:

# The ruler should understand the importance and danger of the authority entrusted to him.  In authority there is great blessing, since he who exercises it righteously obtained unsurpassed happiness but if any ruler fails to do so he incurs torment surpassed only by the torment for unbelief.
# The ruler should always be thirsting to meet devout religious scholars and ask them for advice.
# The ruler should understand that he must not covet the wives of other men and be content with personally refraining from injustice, but must discipline his slave-troops, servants, and officers and never tolerate unjust conduct by them; for he will be interrogated not only about his own unjust deeds but also about those of his staff.
# The ruler should not be dominated by pride; for pride gives rise to the dominance of anger, and will impel him to revenge.  Anger is the evil genius and blight of the intellect.  If anger is becoming dominant it will be necessary for the ruler in all his affairs to bend his inclinations in the direction of forgiveness and make a habit of generosity and forbearance unless he is to be like the wild beasts.
# In every situation that arises, the ruler should figure that he is the subject and the other person is the holder of authority.  He should not sanction for others anything that he would not sanction for himself.  For if he would do so he would be making fraudulent and treasonable use of the authority entrusted to him.
# The ruler should not disregard the attendance of petitioners at his court and should beware of the danger of so doing.  He should solve the grievances of the Muslims.
# The ruler should not form a habit of indulging the passions.  Although he might dress more finely or eat more sumptuously, he should be content with all that he has; for without contentment, just conduct will not be possible.
# The ruler should make the utmost effort to behave gently and avoid governing harshly.
# The ruler should endeavor to keep all the subjects pleased with him.  The ruler should not let himself be so deluded by the praise he gets from any who approach him as to believe that all the subjects are pleased with him.  On the contrary, such praise is entirely due to fear.  He must therefore appoint trustworthy persons to carry on espionage and inquire about his standing among the people, so that he may be able to learn his faults from men's tongues.
# The ruler should not give satisfaction to any person if a contravention of God's law would be required to please him for no harm will come from such a person's displeasure.

==Single Caliph for the Muslim World==

It has been recorded that [[Muhammad]] has said:

''&quot;The children of Israel have been governed by Prophets; whenever a Prophet died another Prophet succeeded him; but there will be no prophet after me. There will be caliphs and they will number many (in one time); they asked: What then do you order us? He said: Fulfil [[bay'ah|bayah]] to them, only the first of them, the first of them, and give them their dues; for verily Allah will ask them about what he entrusted them with&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Kitab al-Imarah (Book of Government)&lt;/ref&gt;

''&quot;When the oath of allegiance has been taken for two Caliphs, kill the latter of them&quot;.''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

[[Abu-Bakr]] Muhammad's primary disciple is reported to have said:

''&quot;It is forbidden for Muslims to have two Amirs for this would cause differences in their affairs and concepts, their unity would be divided and disputes would break out amongst them. The Sunnah would then be abandoned, the bida'a (innovations) would spread and Fitna would grow, and that is in no one's interests&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;&quot;As-Sirah&quot; of [[Ibn Ishaq]]; on the day of [[Thaqifa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umar bin Al-Khattab]] another disciple of Muhammad is reported to have  said: ''&quot;There is no way for two (leaders) together at any one time&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]] the famous 14th century Muslim scholar, economist and historian said:
''&quot;It is not possible to appoint two men to the position (of caliph) at the same time. Religious scholars generally are of this opinion, on the basis of certain [[hadith]](recorded statements) of Muhammad. Those hadith are found in the book entitled, &quot;On Leadership (imarah),&quot; in [[Sahih Muslim]]. They expressly indicate that this is so.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Al-Muqaddimah by [[ibn Khaldun]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th century [[Sunni]] scholar Imam of al-Haramayn (i.e. [[Makkah]] and [[Medinah]])  [[al-Juwayni]] wrote:

''&quot;Our (scholarly) associates agree on precluding the investing of two different individuals with the imamate at either end of the world. But, they add: If it should happen that two different persons were invested with the imamate, that would be analogous to the situation of two guardians contracting a marriage for the same woman to two different suitors without either being aware of the other's contract. The decision in the matter rests on the application of jurisprudence. My opinion on this issue is that investiture of two individuals with the imamate in a single locality within relatively restricted boundaries and limited provinces is not permitted and the investiture should be in accord with a consensus. But, when the distances are great and the two Imams quite remote from each other, there is room to allow it, although this cannot be established conclusively.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter On &quot;Election, It's &lt;!--possibly sic--&gt; Characteristics, and How the Imamate is to Be Invested&quot; paragraph &quot;On investing the imamate in two individuals&quot; in the book &quot;A Guide to the Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief&quot; (Kitab al-irshad ila qawati' al-adilla fi usul al-i'tiqad) by [[al-Juwayni]] p 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th century Sunni jurist [[Al-Mawardi]] wrote:

''&quot;The investment of two rulers in two different cities is invalid in both cases, for the [[ummah]] may not have two rulers simultaneously, even though there are some dissenting voices who would make that permissible. Jurists are disagreed regarding which one of the two should be sovereign. One party take him to be the one elected in the city where the previous leader died, because its residents are more entitled to make the choice, the rest of the Community in other districts delegating the task to them... Others have suggested that each one of the two must give up the office in favour of his opponent, thus allowing the elections to opt for one or the other..&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Ordinances of Government&quot; (Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya w'al-Wilayat al-Diniyyya) pg. 7-8 by [[al-Mawardi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam [[Al-Nawawi]] a 12th century authority of the Sunni [[Shafi'i]] [[madhhab]] said: ''&quot;It is forbidden to give an oath to two caliphs or more, even in different parts of the world and even if they are far apart&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Mughni Al-Muhtaj, volume 4, page 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam [[Al-Juzairi]], a more modern expert on the [[Fiqh]] of the four Sunni [[madhhab]]s said regarding the opinion of the four Imams, ''&quot;...It is forbidden for Muslims to have two Imams in the world whether in agreement or discord.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;'Fiqh ul-Mathahib ul- Arba'a' (the fiqh of the four schools of thought), al-Juzairi, volume 5, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Caliphs==

{{main|List of Caliphs}}

* [[Abu Bakr]]: First [[Four Righteously Guided Caliphs|rightly guided caliph]]. Subdued rebel tribes in the [[Ridda Wars]].
* [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]: Second rightly guided caliph. During his reign, the Islamic empire expanded to include [[Egypt]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Persian Empire|Persia]].
* [[Uthman ibn Affan]]: Third rightly guided caliph. The [[Qur'an]] was compiled under his direction. Killed by rebels.
* [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]: Fourth and last rightly guided caliph, and considered the first [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]] by [[Shi'a]] Muslims. His reign was fraught with internal conflict.
* [[Muawiya I]]: First caliph of the [[Umayyad]] Dynasty. Muawiya instituted dynastic rule by appointing his son [[Yazid]] as his successor, a trend that would continue through subsequent caliphates.
* [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] - Fifth caliph of Ummayad Dynasty, translated important records into Arabic, established an Islamic currency system, led additional wars against the Byzantines and ordered construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]].
* [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]]: Umayyad caliph considered by some (mainly [[Sunnis]]) to be a fifth rightly guided caliph.
* [[Haroun al-Raschid|Harun al-Rashid]]: Abbasid caliph during whose reign [[Baghdad]] became the world's preeminent center of trade, learning, and culture. Harun is the subject of many stories in the famous work [[1001 Arabian Nights]].
* [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]: Fatimid Caliph who led the Shi'a Caliphate to its zenith; Cairo was a center of trade and intellectual activity during his reign.
* [[Selim I]] the Brave: First Caliph of the Ottoman Empire with the conquest of Egypt and the Holy Cities. Defeated the powerful [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Safavid Empire]].
* [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]: Early Ottoman Sultan during whose reign the [[Ottoman Empire]] reached its zenith.
* [[Abdul Mejid II]]: Last Caliph of the Ottoman Dynasty, the 101st Caliph in line from Caliph Abu Bakr. On August 23, 1944, Abdul Mejid II died at his house in the Boulevard Suchet, Paris XVIe, France. He was buried at Medina, Saudi Arabia.
*

Several Arabic surnames found throughout the Middle East are derived from the word ''khalifa''. These include: Khalif, Khalifa, Khillif, Kalif, Kalaf, Khalaf, and Kaylif. The usage of this title as a surname is comparable to the existence of surnames such as King, Duke, and Noble in the English language.

==Dynasties==

The more important dynasties include:

* The [[Umayyad]] dynasty in [[Damascus]] (661–750), followed by:
* The [[Abbasid]] dynasty in [[Baghdad]] (750–1258), and later in [[Cairo]] (under [[Mameluk]] control) (1260–1517).
* The Shi'ite [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] dynasty in [[North Africa]] and [[Egypt]] (909–1171). Not universally accepted and not currently included in [[List of caliphs|the list here]].
* The Rahmanids, a surviving branch of the Damascus Umayyads, established &quot;in exile&quot; as emirs of [[Cordoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]], declared themselves Caliphs (known as the [[Caliph of Cordoba|Caliphs of Cordoba]]; not universally accepted; 929–1031).
* The [[Almohad]] dynasty in [[North Africa]] and [[Spain]] (not universally accepted; 1145–1269). Traced their descent not from Muhammad, but from a puritanic reformer in Morocco who claimed to be the [[Mahdi]] (a puritanic reformer in Morocco, bringing down the &quot;decadent&quot; [[Almoravid]] emirate) whose son established a sultanate and claimed to be a caliph.
* The [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]] (1517–1924; main title [[Padishah]], also known as [[Great Sultan]] etc.), assumed the title after defeating the [[Mamluk Sultanate]] and used it sporadically between the 16th and early 20th centuries.

'''Note on the overlap of Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates''': After the massacre of the Umayyad clan by the Abbassids, one lone prince escaped and fled to North Africa, which remained loyal to the Umayyads. This was [[Abd-ar-rahman I]]. From there, he proceeded to Spain, where he overthrew and united the provinces conquered by previous Umayyad Caliphs (in 712 and 712). From 756 to 929, this Umayyad domain in Spain was an independent emirate, until [[Abd-ar-rahman III]] reclaimed the title of Caliph for his dynasty. The Umayyad Emirs of Spain are not listed in the summary below because they did not claim the caliphate until 929. For a full listing of all the Umayyad rulers in Spain see the [[Umayyad]] article.

==Claims to the caliphate==

Many local rulers throughout Islamic history have claimed to be caliphs. Most claims were ignored outside their limited domains. In many cases, these claims were made by rebels against established authorities and died when the rebellion was crushed. Notable claimants include:
*[[Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], who held the [[Hijaz]] against the Ummayad، certain scholars considered him a legitimate caliph, being a close companion of [[Muhammad]]. His rebellion, centered in [[Makkah]], was crushed by an infamous Umayyad general, [[Hajjaj]]. Hajjaj's attack caused some damage in Makkah, and necessitated the rebuilding of the [[Kaaba]].
*Caliph of the Sudan, a [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] king of the [[Sahel]].
* The [[Imams of Yemen|Zaydi Imams of Yemen]], had been using the title for centuries and continued to use the title till 1962.
*[[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca]], proclaimed himself caliph at [[Medina]] (see [[Sharifian Caliphate]]) two days after the office was abolished by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]]. The [[Saudis]], realizing that a unified Islamic government would pose a threat to the absolute monarchy that they held over Arabia, quickly defeated his movement.

'''Charles Messier''' (26 June 1730 &amp;ndash; 12 April 1817) was a French [[astronomy|astronomer]] most notable for publishing an [[astronomical catalog]]ue consisting of [[deep sky objects]] such as [[nebula]]e and [[star cluster]]s that came to be known as the 110 &quot;[[Messier object]]s&quot;. The purpose of the catalogue was to help astronomical observers, in particular [[comet]] hunters such as himself, distinguish between permanent and transient objects in the sky.
[[Image:Messierbadon.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Plaque commémorative à Badonviller]]

==Messier's life==
Messier was born in [[Badonviller]] in the [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]] region of France, being the tenth of twelve children of Françoise B. Grandblaise and Nicolas Messier, a [[Court usher]]. Six of his brothers and sisters died while young and in 1741, his father died. Charles' interest in astronomy was stimulated by the appearance of the spectacular, [[C/1743 X1|great six-tailed comet]] in 1744 and by an annular [[solar eclipse]] visible from his hometown on 25 July 1748.

In 1751 he entered the employ of [[Joseph Nicolas Delisle]], the astronomer of the [[French Navy]], who instructed him to keep careful records of his observations. Messier's first documented observation was that of the [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury transit]] of 6 May 1753.

In 1764, he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], in 1769, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and on 30 June 1770, he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

Messier discovered 13 comets&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080716110006/http://www.comethunter.de/cat2002/com_disc.txt Maik Meyer. Catalog of comet discoveries]&lt;/ref&gt;:

* C/1760 B1 (Messier)
* C/1763 S1 (Messier)
* C/1764 A1 (Messier)
* C/1766 E1 (Messier)
* C/1769 P1 (Messier)
* [[D/1770 L1]] ([[Anders Johan Lexell|Lexell]])

* C/1773 T1 (Messier)
* C/1780 U2 (Messier)

* C/1793 S2 (Messier)
* C/1798 G1 (Messier)
* C/1785 A1 (Messier-[[Pierre Méchain|Mechain]])

==His catalogue==
The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects and was published in 1774 in the journal of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. The final version of the catalogue was published in 1781, in ''Connoissance des Temps for 1784''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Messier, 1781. Catalogue des Nébuleuses &amp; des amas d'Étoiles. Connoissance des Temps for 1784 (published 1781), pp. 227-267 [Bibcode: 1781CdT..1784..227M].&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web
  | title=Original Messier Catalog of 1781
  | work=Original Messier Catalog of 1781
  | url=http://seds.org/messier/xtra/Mcat/mcat1781.html#messier1781
  | accessdate=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final [[list of Messier objects]] had grown to 103.

On several different occasions between 1921 and 1966, astronomers and historians discovered evidence of another seven deep-sky objects that were observed either by Messier or his friend and assistant, [[Pierre Méchain]], shortly after the final version was published. These seven objects, [[Messier 104|M104]] through [[Messier 110|M110]], are accepted by astronomers as &quot;official&quot; Messier objects.

The objects' Messier designations, from [[Crab Nebula|M1]] to [[Messier 110|M110]], still are in use by professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] today.

The catalogue is not organized scientifically by object type or by location, as the later [[New General Catalogue]] would be.  Nonetheless, the Messier catalogue comprises nearly all the most spectacular examples of the five types of deep sky object -- [[diffuse nebulae]], [[planetary nebulae]], [[open clusters]], [[globular clusters]] and [[galaxies]] -- visible from European latitudes. Because these objects could be observed with the relatively small-aperture refracting [[telescope]] (approximately 102&amp;nbsp;mm, or four inches) used by Messier to study the sky, they are among the brightest and most attractive [[deep sky objects]] observable from earth, and are among the most popular targets for visual study and photography available to modern amateur astronomers using larger aperture equipment.  Furthermore, almost all of the Messier objects are among the closest to our planet in their respective classes, which makes them heavily studied with professional class instruments that today can resolve very small and visually spectacular details in them.  Professional astronomers still often refer to these structures by their Messier designation.

Many of the objects in the Messier catalogue were discovered by his assistant, Pierre Méchain.

The crater [[Messier (crater)|Messier]] on the [[Moon]] and the [[asteroid]] [[7359 Messier]] were named in his honor.

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
The '''Cemetery H culture''' developed out of the northern part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 1900 BCE, in and around western [[Punjab region]] located in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It was named after a cemetery found in &quot;area H&quot; at [[Harappa]].

The Cemetery H culture is part of the Punjab Phase, one of three cultural phases that developed in the [[Localization Era]] of the [[Indus Valley Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenoyer|1991a}}; {{harvnb|Shaffer|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be part of the '''Late Harappan''' phase.

The distinguishing features of this culture include&lt;ref&gt;http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_02.html&lt;/ref&gt;:
* The use of [[cremation]] of human remains. The bones were stored in painted pottery burial urns. This is completely different from the Indus civilization where bodies were buried in wooden coffins. The urn burials and the &quot;grave skeletons&quot; were nearly contemporaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarkar|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reddish pottery, painted in black with [[antelope]]s, [[peacock]]s etc., [[sun]] or [[star]] motifs, with different surface treatments to the earlier period.
* Expansion of settlements into the east.
* [[Rice]] became a main crop.
* Apparent breakdown of the widespread trade of the Indus civilization, with materials such as marine shells no longer used.
* Continued use of mud brick for building.

The Cemetery H culture also &quot;shows clear biological affinities&quot; with the earlier population of Harappa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|2000|p=312}}; {{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=103, 310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist Kenoyer noted that this culture &quot;may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenoyer|1991b|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remains of the culture have been dated from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE. Together with the [[Gandhara grave culture]] and the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]], it is considered by some scholars a nucleus of [[Vedic civilization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Corrado Gini''' (May 23, 1884 &amp;ndash; March 13, 1965) was an Italian [[statistician]], [[demography|demographer]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] who developed the [[Gini coefficient]], a measure of the [[income]] inequality in a [[society]]. Gini was also a leading [[fascism|fascist]] theorist and ideologue who wrote ''The Scientific Basis of Fascism'' in 1927. Gini was a proponent of the concept of [[organicism]] and applied it to nations.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Gini was born on May 23, 1884, in [[Motta di Livenza]], near [[Treviso]], into an old [[landed family]]. He entered the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Bologna]], where in addition to law he studied [[mathematics]], [[economics]], and [[biology]]. His subsequent scientific work ran in two directions: towards the social sciences and towards statistics. His interests ranged well beyond the formal aspects of statistics—to the laws that govern biological and social phenomena.

His first published work was, ''Il sesso dal punto di vista statistico'' (1908). This work is a thorough review of the natal sex ratio, looking at past theories and at how new hypothesis fit the statistical data. In particular, it presents evidence that the tendency to produce one or the other sex of child is, to some extent, heritable.  

In 1910, he acceded to the Chair of Statistics in the [[University of Cagliari]] and then at [[University of Padua|Padua]] in 1913.

He founded the statistical journal ''Metron'' in 1920, directing it until his death. The journal never accepted articles that did not have practical applications.

He became a professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] in 1925. At the University, he founded a lecture course on [[sociology]], maintaining it until his retirement. He also set up the School of Statistics in 1928, and, in 1936, the Faculty of Statistical, Demographic and Actuarial Sciences.

In 1929, Gini founded the Italian Committee for the Study of Population Problems (''Comitato italiano per lo studio dei problemi della popolazione) '' which, two years later, organised the first Population Congress in Rome.

In 1926, he was appointed President of the Central Institute of Statistics in Rome. This he organised as a single centre for Italian statistical services. He resigned in 1932 in protest at interference in his work by the fascist state.

Corrado Gini died in the early hours of March 13, 1965.

==Theory==
===Organicism and nations===
Gini was a proponent of [[organicism]] and saw nations as organic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Gini shared the view held by [[Oswald Spengler]] that populations go through a cycle of birth, growth, and decay.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Gini claimed that nations at a primitive level have a high [[birth rate]], but, as they evolve, the [[Upper class|upper classes]] birth rate drops while the [[lower class]] birth rate, while higher, will inevitably deplete as their stronger members emigrate, die in war, or enter into the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; If a nation continues on this path without resistance, Gini claimed the nation would enter a final [[Decadence|decadent]] stage where the nation would degenerate as noted by decreasing birth rate, decreasing cultural output, and the lack of [[Imperialism|imperial]] conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the decadent nation with its aging population can be overrun by a more youthful and vigorous nation.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Gini's organicist theories of nations and natality are believed to have influenced policies of [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
*In 1933 Gini was elected vice president of the International Sociological Institute.
*In 1934 - president of the Italian [[Genetics]] and [[Eugenics]] Society. 
*In 1935 - president of the International Federation of Eugenics Societies in Latin-language Countries.
*In 1937 - president of the Italian Sociological Society.
*In 1941 - president of the Italian Statistical Society.
*In 1957 he received the Gold Medal for outstanding service to the Italian School.
*In 1962 he was elected National Member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

==Honours==
The following honorary degrees were conferred upon him:
*Economics by the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan (1932), 
*Sociology by the University of Geneva (1934), 
*Sciences by Harvard University (1936), 
*Social Sciences by the University of Cordoba, Argentine (1963).

[[Image:Cshaft.gif|300px|thumb|Crankshaft (red), pistons (gray) in their cylinders (blue), and flywheel (black)]]

The '''crankshaft''', sometimes casually abbreviated to ''[[crank (mechanism)|crank]]'', is the part of an [[engine]] which translates [[reciprocation|reciprocating]] [[linear]] [[piston]] motion into rotation. To convert the reciprocating motion into rotation, the crankshaft has &quot;crank throws&quot; or &quot;[[crankpin]]s&quot;, additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the &quot;big ends&quot; of the [[connecting rod]]s from each cylinder attach.

It typically connects to a [[flywheel]], to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the [[four-stroke cycle]], and sometimes a torsional or vibrational damper at the opposite end, to reduce the [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] vibrations often caused along the length of the crankshaft by the cylinders farthest from the output end acting on the torsional elasticity of the metal.

=== Western World ===

[[File:Roman crank handle, Augusta Raurica, Switzerland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] crankshaft dated to the 2nd century AD. The right handle is lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiöler 2009, 113&quot;/&gt;]]

A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] iron crankshaft of yet unknown purpose dating to the 2nd century AD was excavated in [[Augusta Raurica]], [[Switzerland]]. The 82.5&amp;nbsp;cm long piece has fitted to one end a 15&amp;nbsp;cm long bronze handle, the other handle being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laur-Belart|1988|p=51–52, 56, fig. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiöler 2009, 113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schiöler|2009|pp=113f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Römische Sägemühle.svg|thumb|Roman [[Hierapolis sawmill]] from the 3rd century AD, the earliest known machine to combine a crank with a connecting rod.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161&quot;/&gt;]]

The earliest evidence, anywhere in the world, for a crank and [[connecting rod]] in a machine appears in the late Roman [[Hierapolis sawmill]] from the 3rd century AD and two Roman stone [[sawmill]]s at [[Gerasa]], [[Roman Syria]], and [[Ephesus]], [[Asia Minor]] (both 6th century AD).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}: {{quote|Because of the findings at Ephesus and Gerasa the invention of the crank and connecting rod system has had to be redated from the 13th to the 6th c; now the Hierapolis relief takes it back another three centuries, which confirms that water-powered stone saw mills were indeed in use when [[Ausonius]] wrote his Mosella.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[pediment]] of the Hierapolis mill, a [[waterwheel]] fed by a [[mill race]] is shown powering via a [[gear train]] two [[frame saw]]s which cut rectangular blocks by the way of some kind of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks. The accompanying inscription is in [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|pp=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crank and connecting rod mechanisms of the other two archaeologically attested sawmills worked without a [[gear train]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|pp=149–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mangartz|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient literature, we find a reference to the workings of water-powered [[marble]] saws close to [[Trier]], now [[Germany]], by the late 4th century poet [[Ausonius]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161&quot;/&gt; about the same time, these mill types seem also to be indicated by the [[Christian saint]] [[Gregory of Nyssa]] from [[Anatolia]], demonstrating a diversified use of water-power in many parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three finds push back the date of the invention of the crank and connecting rod back by a full millennium;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161&quot;/&gt; for the first time, all essential components of the much later [[steam engine]] were assembled by one technological culture:
 
{{quote|With the crank and connecting rod system, all elements for constructing a steam engine (invented in 1712) — [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]]'s [[aeolipile]] (generating steam power), the [[cylinder]] and [[piston]] (in metal force pumps), non-return [[valves]] (in water pumps), [[gearing]] (in water mills and clocks) — were known in Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=156, fn. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Skizze Kurbelwagen (Vigevano).jpeg|thumb|upright|100px|[[Guido da Vigevano|Vigevano]]'s war carriage]]

The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] (c. 1280−1349), planning for a new crusade, made illustrations for a [[paddle boat]] and war carriages that were propelled by manually turned compound cranks and gear wheels (center of image).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Luttrell Psalter]], dating to around 1340, describes a grindstone which was rotated by two cranks, one at each end of its axle; the geared hand-mill, operated either with one or two cranks, appeared later in the 15th century;&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Renaissance ====
{{Seealso|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Anonymous of the Hussite Wars. Clm 197, Part 1, Folio 17v Supra.jpg|thumb|left|15th century paddle-wheel boat whose paddles are turned by single-throw crankshafts (Anonymous of the [[Hussite Wars]])]] 

The first depictions of the compound crank in the carpenter's [[Brace (tool)|brace]] appear between 1420 and 1430 in various northern European artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 112&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid adoption of the compound crank can be traced in the works of the [[Anonymous of the Hussite Wars]], an unknown German engineer writing on the state of the military technology of his day: first, the connecting-rod, applied to cranks, reappeared, second, double compound cranks also began to be equipped with connecting-rods and third, the flywheel was employed for these cranks to get them over the 'dead-spot'.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Renaissance Italy]], the earliest evidence of a compound crank and connecting-rod is found in the sketch books of [[Taccola]], but the device is still mechanically misunderstood.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 113&quot;/&gt; A sound grasp of the crank motion involved demonstrates a little later [[Pisanello]] who painted a piston-pump driven by a water-wheel and operated by two simple cranks and two connecting-rods.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 113&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006690 Mechanik ^ Wasserförderung ^ Pumpe.jpg|thumb|150px|Water-raising pump powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism ([[Georg Andreas Böckler]], 1661)]]

One of the drawings of the Anonymous of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddle-wheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks (see above). The concept was much improved by the Italian [[Roberto Valturio]] in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting-rod, an idea also taken up by his compatriot [[Francesco di Giorgio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 114&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Crankshafts were also described by [[Konrad Kyeser]] (d. 1405), [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519)&lt;ref name=Crank/&gt; and a Dutch &quot;farmer&quot; by the name [[Cornelis Corneliszoon]] van Uitgeest in 1592. His wind-powered [[sawmill]] used a crankshaft to convert a windmill's circular motion into a back-and-forward motion powering the saw. Corneliszoon was granted a [[patent]] for his crankshaft in 1597.

From the 16th century onwards, evidence of cranks and connecting rods integrated into machine design becomes abundant in the technological treatises of the period: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 alone depicts eighteen examples, a number which rises in the ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas Böckler]] to 45 different machines, one third of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Middle and Far East ===
[[Al-Jazari]] (1136&amp;ndash;1206) described a crank and connecting rod system in a rotating machine in two of his water-raising machines.&lt;ref name=Crank&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]. [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%203.htm The Crank-Connecting Rod System in a Continuously Rotating Machine].&lt;/ref&gt; His twin-cylinder [[pump]] incorporated a crankshaft,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islam and Science, Medicine, and Technology|last=Sally Ganchy|first=Sarah Gancher|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=1435850661|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the device was unnecessarily complex indicating that he still did not fully understand the concept of power conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=170}}: {{quote|However, that al-Jazari did not entirely grasp the meaning of the crank for joining reciprocating with rotary motion is shown by his extraordinarily complex pump powered through a cog-wheel mounted eccentrically on its axle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the potential of the crank of converting circular motion into reciprocal one never seems to have been fully realized, and the crank was typically absent from such machines until the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=104}}: {{quote|Yet a student of the Chinese technology of the early twentieth century remarks that even a generation ago the Chinese had not 'reached that stage where continuous rotary motion is substituted for reciprocating motion in technical contrivances such as the drill, lathe, saw, etc. To take this step familiarity with the crank is necessary. The crank in its simple rudimentary form we find in the [modern] Chinese windlass, which use of the device, however, has apparently not given the impulse to change reciprocating into circular motion in other contrivances'. In China the crank was known, but remained dormant for at least nineteen centuries, its explosive potential for applied mechanics being unrecognized and unexploited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:Four stroke engine diagram.jpg|thumbnail|right|Components of a typical, [[four stroke cycle]], DOHC piston engine. (E) Exhaust [[camshaft]], (I) Intake camshaft, (S) [[Spark plug]], (V) [[poppet valve|Valve]]s, (P) [[Piston]], (R) [[Connecting rod]], (C) Crankshaft, (W) Water jacket for coolant flow.]]

Large engines are usually [[engine configuration|multicylinder]] to reduce pulsations from individual firing [[stroke (engines)|strokes]], with more than one piston attached to a complex crankshaft. Many small engines, such as those found in [[moped]]s or garden machinery, are single cylinder and use only a single piston, simplifying crankshaft design. This engine can also be built with no riveted seam.

===Bearings===
The crankshaft has a linear [[Axis of rotation|axis]] about which it rotates, typically with several bearing journals riding on replaceable [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] (the [[main bearing]]s) held in the engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes a great deal of sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of [[V8 engine]]s, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to [[straight-8]] engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher [[compression ratio]]s and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.

===Piston stroke===
The distance the axis of the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] measurement, and thus [[engine displacement]]. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine is to increase the stroke, sometimes known as &quot;shaft-stroking.&quot; This also increases the [[engine balance|reciprocating vibration]], however, limiting the high speed capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. For this reason, even such high speed production engines as current [[Honda]] engines are classified as &quot;under square&quot; or long-stroke, in that the stroke is longer than the diameter of the [[cylinder bore]].  As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length will lead to better results.

===Engine configuration===
The [[Engine configuration|configuration]] and number of pistons in relation to each other and the crank leads to [[straight engine|straight]], [[V engine|V]] or [[flat engine]]s. The same basic [[engine block]] can be used with different crankshafts, however, to alter the [[firing order]]; for instance, the 90° [[V6 engine]] configuration, in older days sometimes derived by using six cylinders of a [[V8 engine]] with what is basically a shortened version of the V8 crankshaft, produces an engine with an [[V6 engine#Odd and even firing|inherent pulsation in the power flow]] due to the &quot;missing&quot; two cylinders. The same engine, however, can be made to provide evenly spaced power pulses by using a crankshaft with an individual crank throw for each cylinder, spaced so that the pistons are actually phased 120° apart, as in the [[GM 3800 engine]]. While production V8 engines use four crank throws spaced 90° apart, high-performance V8 engines often use a &quot;flat&quot; crankshaft with throws spaced 180° apart. The difference can be heard as the flat-plane crankshafts result in the engine having a smoother, higher-pitched sound than cross-plane (for example, [[IndyCar Series|IRL IndyCar Series]] compared to [[Nextel Cup|NASCAR Nextel Cup]], or a [[Ferrari 355]] compared to a [[Chevrolet Corvette]]). See the main article on [[crossplane]] crankshafts.

===Engine balance===
For some engines it is necessary to provide [[counterweight]]s for the reciprocating mass of each piston and connecting rod to improve [[engine balance]]. These are typically cast as part of the crankshaft but, occasionally, are bolt-on pieces. While counter weights add a considerable amount of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine and allows higher RPMs to be reached.

===Rotary engines===
Many early aircraft engines (and a few in other applications) had the crankshaft fixed to the [[airframe]] and instead the cylinders rotated, known as a [[rotary engine]] design. Rotary engines such as the [[Wankel engine]] are referred to as pistonless rotary engines.

In the [[Wankel engine]], also called a rotary engine, the rotors drive the eccentric shaft, which could be considered the equivalent of the crankshaft in a piston engine.

==Construction==
[[Image:Marine Crankshafts 8b03602r.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Continental engine]] marine crankshafts, 1942]]

Crankshafts can be monolithic (made in a single piece) or assembled from several pieces. Monolithic crankshafts are most common, but some smaller and larger engines use assembled crankshafts.

===Forging and casting===
Crankshafts can be [[forging|forged]] from a steel bar usually through roll forging or [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] in ductile steel. Today more and more manufacturers tend to favor the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent dampening. With forged crankshafts, [[Vanadium#Applications|vanadium]] microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as those found in the Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.

===Machining===
Crankshafts can also be [[Machining|machined]] out of a [[Billet (manufacturing)|billet]], often using a bar of high quality vacuum remelted steel. Even though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesn’t follow the shape of the crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels which normally are difficult to forge can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material removal which needs to be done by using lathes and milling machines, the high material cost and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is required, this production method allows small production runs of crankshafts to be made without high costs.

===Fatigue strength===
The fatigue strength of crankshafts is usually increased by using a radius at the ends of each main and crankpin bearing. The radius itself reduces the stress in these critical areas, but since the radii in most cases are rolled, this also leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface which prevents cracks from forming.

===Hardening===
Most production crankshafts use induction hardened bearing surfaces since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without having to redo the hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, tend to use [[nitridization]] instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel, in order to be able to create stable nitrides. The advantage with nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface and the process will leave some compressive residual stress in the surface which is good for the fatigue properties of the crankshaft. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesn’t have any negative effects on the steel, such as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of [[carburization]] tends to be favored due to the high [[Hertzian contact stress]]es in such an application. Like nitriding, carburization also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.

===Counterweights===
Some expensive, high performance crankshafts also use heavy-metal counterweights to make the crankshaft more compact. The heavy-metal used is most often a tungsten alloy but depleted uranium has also been used. A cheaper option is to use lead, but compared with tungsten its density is much lower.

==Stress on crankshafts==
The shaft is subjected to various forces but generally needs to be analysed in two positions.
Firstly, failure may occur at the position of maximum bending; this may be at the centre of the crank or at either end. In such a condition the failure is due to bending and the pressure in the cylinder is maximal. Second, the crank may fail due to twisting, so the conrod needs to be checked for shear at the position of maximal twisting. The pressure at this position is the maximal pressure, but only a fraction of maximal pressure.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''central nervous system''' ('''CNS''') is the part of the [[nervous system]] that integrates the information that it receives from, and coordinates the activity of, all parts of the bodies of [[bilaterian]] animals—that is, all multicellular animals except [[sponge]]s and radially symmetric animals such as [[radiata|jellyfish]]. It contains the majority of the nervous system and consists of the [[brain]] and the [[spinal cord]]. Some classifications also include the [[retina]] and the [[cranial nerves]] in the CNS. Together with the [[peripheral nervous system]], it has a fundamental role in the control of [[behavior]]. The CNS is contained within the [[dorsal cavity]], with the [[brain]] in the [[cranial cavity]] and the spinal cord in the [[spinal cavity]]. In [[vertebrate]]s, the brain is protected by the skull, while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae, and both are enclosed in the [[meninges]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Development of the neural tube.png|thumb|left|Development of the neural tube]]
{{Main|Neuroanatomy}}
During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal [[neural groove|groove]] on the [[neural plate]] gradually deepens as ridges on either side of the groove (the [[neural folds]]) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a [[neural tube|closed tube]], the [[ectoderm]]al wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system. This tube initially differentiates into three [[vesicles]] (pockets): the [[prosencephalon]] at the front, the [[mesencephalon]], and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the [[rhombencephalon]]. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the [[telencephalon]] and [[diencephalon]]; and the rhombencephalon divides into the [[metencephalon]] and [[myelencephalon]].

As the vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the [[striatum]], the [[hippocampus]] and the [[neocortex]], and its cavity becomes the [[lateral ventricles|first and second ventricles]]. Diencephalon elaborations include the [[subthalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]] and [[epithalamus]], and its cavity forms the [[third ventricle]]. The [[tectum]], [[pretectum]], [[cerebral peduncle]] and other structures develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the [[mesencephalic duct]] (cerebral aqueduct). The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]], the myelencephalon forms the [[medulla oblongata]], and their cavities develop into the fourth ventricle.

Their primitive brain, consisting of two fused anterior ganglia, and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS; the laterally projecting nerves form the PNS. A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians, which includes genes related to the CNS, also exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Katsuhiko Mineta, et al.|title=Origin and evolutionary process of the CNS elucidated by comparative genomics analysis of planarian ESTs|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7666.full.pdf+html?sid=b2a914e7-5647-4ee2-835c-bc54c4927a98|journal=PNAS|format = pdf|volume=100|issue=13|pages=7666–7671|year=2003|doi=10.1073/pnas.1332513100|pmid=12802012|pmc=164645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like planarians, vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS, though more complex than those of planarians.

The basic pattern of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species of [[vertebrates]] and during evolution. The major trend that can be observed is towards a progressive telencephalisation: the [[telencephalon]] of reptiles is only an appendix to the large [[olfactory bulb]], while in mammals it makes up most of the volume of the CNS. In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of the [[diencephalon]] and the [[mesencephalon]]. Indeed, the [[allometry|allometric]] study of brain size among different species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and allows us to complete the knowledge about the evolution of the CNS obtained through [[cranial endocast]]s.

[[Mammal]]s – which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and reptiles – are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the cerebral cortex known as the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name=MarkFBear&gt;{{cite book

Within placental mammals, the size and complexity of the neocortex increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans.&lt;ref name=MarkFBear&gt;198&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions.&lt;ref name=MarkFBear&gt;199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseases of the central nervous system==
There are many central nervous system diseases, including [[List of central nervous system infections|infections]] of the central nervous system such as [[encephalitis]] and [[poliomyelitis]], [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]] such as Alzheimer's disease and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] and inflammatory diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]], and genetic disorders such as [[Krabbe's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], or [[adrenoleukodystrophy]]. Lastly, cancers of the central nervous system can cause severe illness and, when [[Malignant brain tumor|malignant]], can have very high mortality rates.

[[Image:Major events in mitosis.svg|right|thumb|350px|Each turn of the cell cycle divides the [[chromosome]]s in a [[cell nucleus]].]]
The '''cell cycle''', or '''cell-division cycle''', is the series of events that takes place in a [[cell (biology)|cell]] leading to its division and duplication (replication). In cells without a nucleus ([[prokaryotic]]), the cell cycle occurs via a process termed [[binary fission]]. In cells with a nucleus ([[eukaryotes]]), the cell cycle can be divided in two brief periods: [[interphase]]—during which the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis and [[DNA replication|duplicating its DNA]]—and the [[mitosis]] (M) phase, during which the cell splits itself into two distinct cells, often called &quot;daughter cells&quot;. The cell-division cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled [[fertilized egg]] develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which [[hair]], [[skin]], [[blood cell]]s, and some internal organs are renewed.

==Phases==
The cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: [[G1 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase]], [[S phase]] (synthesis), [[G2 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] (collectively known as [[interphase]]) and [[Mitosis|M phase]] (mitosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: mitosis, in which the cell's [[chromosomes]] are divided between the two daughter cells, and [[cytokinesis]], in which the cell's [[cytoplasm]] divides in half forming distinct cells. Activation of each phase is dependent on the proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of [[quiescence]] called [[G0 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase]].

After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the [[interphase]] of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division.

=== Resting (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase) ===

The term &quot;post-mitotic&quot; is sometimes used to refer to both [[G0 phase|quiescent]] and [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|senescent]] cells. Nonproliferative cells in multicellular [[eukaryote]]s generally enter the quiescent G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; state from G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for [[neuron]]s). This is very common for cells that are fully [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]]. Cellular senescence is a state that occurs in response to DNA damage or degradation that would make a cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by [[apoptosis]].

===Interphase===
Before a cell can enter cell division, it needs to take in nutrients. All of the preparations are done during the interphase. Interphase proceeds in three stages, G1, S, and G2. Cell division operates in a cycle. Therefore, interphase is preceded by the previous cycle of mitosis and cytokinesis.

====G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase====

The first phase within interphase, from the end of the previous M phase until the beginning of DNA synthesis is called [[G1 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (G indicating ''gap'').  It is also called the growth phase.  During this phase the biosynthetic activities of the cell, which had been considerably slowed down during M phase, resume at a high rate.  This phase is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required in S phase, mainly those needed for DNA replication. Duration of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is highly variable, even among different cells of the same species.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4515625&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith JA, Martin L | title = Do cells cycle? | journal = Proc.

====S phase====

The ensuing [[S phase]] starts when [[DNA]] synthesis commences; when it is complete, all of the [[chromosome]]s have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome has two (sister) [[chromatid]]s. Thus, during this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the [[ploidy]] of the cell remains the same. Rates of RNA [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and protein synthesis are very low during this phase. An exception to this is [[histone]] production, most of which occurs during the S phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7199388&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wu RS, Bonner WM | title = Separation of basal histone synthesis from S-phase histone synthesis in dividing cells | journal = Cell | volume = 27 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 321–30 | year = 1981 | month = December | pmid = 7199388 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90415-3 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12370293&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson DM, Ye X, Hall C, Santos H, Ma T, Kao GD, Yen TJ, Harper JW, Adams PD | title = Coupling of DNA synthesis and histone synthesis in S phase independent of cyclin/cdk2 activity | journal = Mol.

====G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase====

The cell then enters the [[G2 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase]], which lasts until the cell enters mitosis. Again, significant biosynthesis occurs during this phase, mainly involving the production of [[microtubule]]s, which are required during the process of mitosis. Inhibition of protein synthesis during G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase prevents the cell from undergoing mitosis.

=== Mitosis (M Phase/Mitotic phase) ===
{{Main|Mitosis}}
The relatively brief [[M phase]] consists of nuclear division ([[karyokinesis]]). The M phase has been broken down into several distinct phases, sequentially known as:
* [[prophase]],
* [[metaphase]],
* [[anaphase]],
* [[telophase]]
* [[cytokinesis]] (strictly speaking, cytokinesis is not part of mitosis but is an event that directly follows mitosis in which cytoplasm is divided into two daughter cells)
'''Mitosis''' is the process by which a [[eukaryotic]] cell separates the [[chromosome]]s in its [[cell nucleus]] into two identical sets in two  nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Irwin, and Susan M. Wick. &quot;Cell.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. 12 January 2008 &lt;http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar102240&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally followed immediately by [[cytokinesis]], which divides the nuclei, [[cytoplasm]], [[organelle]]s and [[cell membrane]] into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the '''mitotic (M) phase''' of the cell cycle - the [[cell division|division]] of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle.

Mitosis occurs exclusively in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, but occurs in different ways in different species. For example, [[animal]]s undergo an &quot;open&quot; mitosis, where the [[nuclear envelope]] breaks down before the chromosomes separate, while [[fungi]] such as ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' ([[yeast]]) undergo a &quot;closed&quot; mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an intact [[cell nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Souza CP, Osmani SA |title=Mitosis, not just open or closed |journal=Eukaryotic Cell |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=1521–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17660363 |doi=10.1128/EC.00178-07 |pmc=2043359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells, which lack a nucleus, divide by a process called [[binary fission]].

The process of mitosis is complex and highly regulated. The sequence of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During the process of mitosis the pairs of [[chromosomes]] condense and attach to fibers that pull the [[sister chromatids]] to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in [[cytokinesis]], to produce two identical daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | authorlink = | coauthors = Hopkins, Jean Johnson, Susan LaHart, David, Quon Warner, David, Wright, Jill D | title = Cells: Building Blocks of Life | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1997 | location = New Jersey | pages = 70–4 | isbn = 0-13423476-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because cytokinesis usually occurs in conjunction with mitosis, &quot;mitosis&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;M phase&quot;. However, there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. This occurs most notably among the [[fungus|fungi]] and [[slime mould]]s, but is found in various different groups. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] embryonic development.&lt;ref name=Lilly&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lilly M, Duronio R | title = New insights into cell cycle control from the Drosophila endocycle | journal = Oncogene | volume = 24 | issue = 17 | pages = 2765–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15838513 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1208610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in mitosis can either kill a cell through [[apoptosis]] or cause [[mutation]]s that may lead to [[cancer]].

==Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle==



Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. The molecular events that control the cell cycle are ordered and directional; that is, each process occurs in a sequential fashion and it is impossible to &quot;reverse&quot; the cycle.

===Role of cyclins and CDKs===

Two key classes of regulatory molecules, [[cyclin]]s and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (CDKs), determine a cell's progress through the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7575488&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nigg EA | title = Cyclin-dependent protein kinases: key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle | journal = Bioessays | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 471–80 | year = 1995 | month = June | pmid = 7575488 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950170603 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leland H. Hartwell]], [[R. Timothy Hunt]], and [[Paul M. Nurse]] won the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their discovery of these central molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/press.html | publisher=Nobelprize.org | title=Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the genes encoding cyclins and CDKs are [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] among all eukaryotes, but in general more complex organisms have more elaborate cell cycle control systems that incorporate more individual components. Many of the relevant genes were first identified by studying yeast, especially ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9843569&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spellman PT, Sherlock G, Zhang MQ, Iyer VR, Anders K, Eisen MB, Brown PO, Botstein D, Futcher B | title = Comprehensive identification of cell cycle-regulated genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by microarray hybridization | journal = Mol.

Cyclins form the regulatory subunits and CDKs the catalytic subunits of an activated [[heterodimer]]; cyclins have no catalytic activity and CDKs are inactive in the absence of a partner cyclin. When activated by a bound cyclin, CDKs perform a common biochemical reaction called [[phosphorylation]] that activates or inactivates target proteins to orchestrate coordinated entry into the next phase of the cell cycle. Different cyclin-CDK combinations determine the downstream proteins targeted. CDKs are constitutively expressed in cells whereas cyclins are synthesised at specific stages of the cell cycle, in response to various molecular signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins and Cotran  |coauthors= Kumar, Abbas, Fausto |title= Pathological Basis of Disease |publisher= [[Elsevier]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 81-8147-528-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General mechanism of cyclin-CDK interaction====
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2010}}
Upon receiving a pro-mitotic extracellular signal, G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[cyclin-CDK]] complexes become active to prepare the cell for S phase, promoting the expression of [[transcription factor]]s that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for [[DNA replication]]. The G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for [[ubiquitination]]. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the [[proteasome]].

Active S cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate proteins that make up the [[pre-replication complex]]es assembled during G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase on DNA [[origin of replication|replication origins]]. The phosphorylation serves two purposes: to activate each already-assembled pre-replication complex, and to prevent new complexes from forming. This ensures that every portion of the cell's [[genome]] will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is fairly clear, because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to [[gene copy number]] effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.

Mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, which are synthesized but inactivated during S and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phases, promote the initiation of [[mitosis]] by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and [[mitotic spindle]] assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a [[ubiquitin ligase]] known as the [[anaphase-promoting complex]] (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal [[kinetochore]]. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and cytokinesis can proceed.

Interphase: Interphase generally lasts at least 12 to 24 hours in mammalian tissue. During this period, the cell is constantly synthesizing RNA, producing protein and growing in size. By studying molecular events in cells, scientists have determined that interphase can be divided into 4 steps: Gap 0 (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Gap 1 (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), S (synthesis) phase, Gap 2 (G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

====Specific action of cyclin-CDK complexes====

[[Cyclin D]] is the first cyclin produced in the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals (e.g. [[growth factor]]s). Cyclin D binds to existing [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 4|CDK4]], forming the active cyclin D-CDK4 complex. Cyclin D-CDK4 complex in turn phosphorylates the [[retinoblastoma]] susceptibility protein ([[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]]). The hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from the E2F/DP1/Rb complex (which was bound to the [[E2F]] responsive genes, effectively &quot;blocking&quot; them from transcription), activating E2F. Activation of E2F results in transcription of various genes like [[cyclin E]], [[cyclin A]], [[DNA polymerase]], [[thymidine kinase]], etc. Cyclin E thus produced binds to [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2|CDK2]], forming the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, which pushes the cell from G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to S phase (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S transition). Cyclin B along with cdc2 (cdc2 - fission yeasts (CDK1 - mammalia)) forms the cyclin B-cdc2 complex, which initiates the G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-324719-5&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author =  Norbury C | authorlink = | editor = Hardie, D.

=== Inhibitors ===
[[Image:Signal transduction v1.png|300px|thumb|right|Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in [[apoptosis]], also known as &quot;programmed cell death&quot;.]]
Two families of genes, the ''cip/kip'' family and the INK4a/ARF (''In''hibitor of ''K''inase 4/''A''lternative ''R''eading ''F''rame) prevent the progression of the cell cycle. Because these genes are instrumental in prevention of [[tumor]] formation, they are known as [[tumor suppressor]]s.

The '''''cip/kip'' family''' includes the genes [[p21]], [[p27 (gene)|p27]] and [[P57 (gene)|p57]]. They halt cell cycle in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase, by binding to, and inactivating, cyclin-CDK complexes. p21 is activated by [[p53]] (which, in turn, is triggered by DNA damage e.g. due to radiation). p27 is activated by Transforming Growth Factor β ([[TGF β]]), a growth inhibitor.

The '''INK4a/ARF family''' includes [[p16INK4a]], which binds to CDK4 and arrests the cell cycle in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase, and [[p14arf]] which prevents p53 degradation.

Synthetic inhibitors of [[Cdc25]] could also be useful for the arrest of cell cycle and therefore be useful as antineoplastic and anticancer agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref 1&quot;&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/presentations/cdc25.html Presentation on CDC25 PHOSPHATASES: A Potential Target for Novel Anticancer Agents]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcriptional Regulatory Network===

Evidence suggests that a semi-autonomous transcriptional network acts in concert with the CDK-cyclin machinery to regulate the cell cycle.  Several gene expression studies in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' have identified approximately 800 to 1200 genes that change expression over the course of the cell cycle;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9843569&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pramilaetal2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pramila T, Wu W, Miles S, Breeden L | title = The Forkhead transcription factor Hcm1 regulates chromosome segregation genes and fills the S-phase gap in the transcriptional circuitry of the cell cycle | journal = Genes Dev | volume = 20| issue = 20 | pages = 2266–227 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16912276| pmc = 1553209| doi = 10.1101/gad.1450606 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orlandoeta1nature2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Orlando DA, Lin CY, Bernard A, Wang JY, Socolar JES, Iversen ES, Hartemink AJ, Haase SB | title = Global control of cell-cycle transcription by coupled CDK and network oscillators | journal = Nature | volume = 453| issue = 453 | pages = 944–947 | year = 2008 | month = June | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/nature06955 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7197/full/nature06955.html | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are transcribed at high levels at specific points in the cell cycle, and remain at lower levels throughout the rest of the cell cycle.

Many periodically expressed genes are driven by [[transcription factors]] that are also periodically expressed.  One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription factors) that show cell cycle progression defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;whiteetal2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = White MA, Riles L, Cohen BA | title = A systematic screen for transcriptional regulators of the yeast cell cycle | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 435–46 | year = 2009 | month = February | pmid = 19033152 | pmc = 2644938| doi =  10.1534/genetics.108.098145 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/181/2/435 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription factors that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription factors that drive phase-specific gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;pramilaetal2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leeetal2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lee T, et. al | title = Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5594 | pages = 799–804 | year = 2002 | month = October| pmid = 12399584| pmc = | doi =  10.1126/science.1075090 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expression profiles of these transcription factors are driven by the transcription factors that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).&lt;ref name=&quot;orlandoeta1nature2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;simonetal2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simon I, et. al | title = Serial Regulation of Transcriptional Regulators in the Yeast Cell Cycle | journal = Cell | volume = 106 | issue = 6 | pages = 697–708 | year = 2001 | month = September | pmid = 11572776| pmc = | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00494-9 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSN-442RRFR-7/2/47b2bb3b8e41c7ca6592599402cee9b5 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental evidence also suggests that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery.  Orlando ''et al.'' used microarrays to measure the expression of a set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (''clb1,2,3,4,5,6'').  Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells at the same time as in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between [[G1]] and [[S phase]].  However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery.  Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells.  These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events.&lt;ref name=&quot;orlandoeta1nature2008&quot; /&gt;  Other work indicates that [[phosphorylation]], a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by [[Cdk1]] may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes (Ubersax ''et al.'' 2003; Sidorova ''et al.'' 1995; White ''et al.'' 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;whiteetal2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sidorova1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sidorova JM, Mikesell GE, Breeden LL | title = Cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Swi6 controls its nuclear localization | journal = Mol Biol Cell. | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 1641–1658 | year = 1995 | month = December | pmid = 8590795| pmc = 301322| doi = 10.1038/nature02062 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6960/abs/nature02062.html | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ubersaxetal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ubersax J, et. al | title = Targets of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 | journal = Nature | volume = 425 | issue = 6960| pages = 859–864 | year = 2003 | month = October | pmid = 14574415| pmc = 301322 | doi = 10.1038/nature02062| issn = | bibcode = 2003Natur.425..859U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While oscillatory transcription plays a key role in the progression of the yeast cell cycle, the CDK-cyclin machinery operates independently in the early embryonic cell cycle.  Before the [[midblastula transition]], zygotic transcription does not occur and all needed proteins, such as the B-type cyclins, are translated from maternally loaded [[mRNA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;davidmorganbook2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author =  Morgan DO | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control | edition = | language = | publisher = New Science Press | location = London | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = 18 | chapter = 2-3 | quote = | isbn = 0=9539181-2-2 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Checkpoints ==

{{Main|Cell cycle checkpoint}}

[[Cell cycle checkpoint]]s are used by the cell to monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/5293/1664 | title= Cell Cycle Checkpoints: Preventing an Identity Crisis| author= Stephen J. Elledge| journal= Science | date= 6 December 1996 | volume=274 | issue=5293| pages= 1664–1672 | pmid = 8939848  | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5293.1664  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Checkpoints prevent cell cycle progression at specific points, allowing verification of necessary phase processes and repair of [[DNA damage]]. The cell cannot proceed to the next phase until checkpoint requirements have been met.

Several checkpoints are designed to ensure that damaged or incomplete DNA is not passed on to daughter cells. Two main checkpoints exist: the [[Cell_cycle_checkpoint#Restriction_Checkpoint|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S checkpoint]] and the [[Cell cycle checkpoint#G2 Checkpoint|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M checkpoint]]. G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S transition is a rate-limiting step in the cell cycle and is also known as [[restriction point]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt; An alternative model of the cell cycle response to DNA damage has also been proposed, known as the [[postreplication checkpoint]].

[[p53]] plays an important role in triggering the control mechanisms at both G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M checkpoints.

== Role in tumor formation ==

A disregulation of the cell cycle components may lead to [[tumor]] formation. As mentioned above, some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, [[Retinoblastoma protein|RB]], [[p53]] etc., when they mutate, may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in active cell division (versus quiescent cells in G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase) in tumors is much higher than that in normal tissue. Thus there is a net increase in cell number as the number of cells that die by apoptosis or senescence remains the same.

The cells which are actively undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by [[Chemotherapy|drugs]] or [[Radiotherapy|radiation]]. This fact is made use of in cancer treatment; by a process known as [[debulking]], a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt;

The fastest cycling mammalian cells in culture, crypt cells in the intestinal epithelium, have a cycle time as short as 9 to 10 hours. Stem cells in resting mouse skin may have a cycle time of more than 200 hours. Most of this difference is due to the varying length of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the most variable phase of the cycle. M and S do not vary much.

In general, cells are most radiosensitive in late M and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phases and most resistant in late S.

For cells with a longer cell cycle time and a significantly long G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase, there is a second peak of resistance late in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

The pattern of resistance and sensitivity correlates with the level of sulfhydryl compounds in the cell. Sulfhydryls are natural radioprotectors and tend to be at their highest levels in S and at their lowest near mitosis.

== Synchronization of cell cultures ==

Several methods can be used to [[Cell synchronization|synchronise cell cultures]] by halting the cell cycle at a particular phase. For example, [[serum starvation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10642581&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kues WA, Anger M, Carnwath JW, Paul D, Motlik J, Niemann H | title = Cell cycle synchronization of porcine fetal fibroblasts: effects of serum deprivation and reversible cell cycle inhibitors | journal = Biol.

'''Connection''' is essential to all [[partner dancing]] and is the primary means to communicate synchronized dance movement between the [[lead and follow]]. It is especially important in [[Argentine Tango]], [[Lindy Hop]], [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], [[East Coast Swing]], [[West Coast Swing]], [[salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Contra dance]], [[Modern Jive]] and other styles of partner dance. Other forms of communication, such as visual cues or spoken cues, are often considered to spoil the dance, unless used in specific circumstances, e.g., practicing figures, or figures which are purposely danced without physical connection. Connection can be used to transmit power and energy as well as information and signals - some dance forms (and some dancers) are at one extreme of pure power, and others will be at the other extreme of pure signaling, but most are probably a mixture of both.

Following and leading in a partner dance is accomplished by maintaining a physical connection called the [[frame (dance)|frame]] that allows the leader to transmit body movement to the follower, and for the follower to suggest ideas to the leader. A frame is a stable structural combination of both bodies maintained through the dancers' arms and/or legs. 

Connection occurs in both [[open position|open]] and closed dance positions (also called &quot;open frame&quot; and &quot;closed frame&quot;).

In [[closed position]] with [[body contact (dance)|body contact]], connection is achieved by maintaining the frame. The follower moves to match the leader, maintaining the pressure between the two bodies as well as the position.

In an open position or a closed position without body contact, the hands and arms alone provide the connection, which may be one of three forms: tension, compression or neutral.

* During '''tension''' or '''leverage connection''', the dancers are pulling away from each other with an equal and opposite force.  The arms do not originate this force alone: they are often assisted by tension in trunk musculature, through body weight or by momentum.
* During '''compression connection''', the dancers are pushing towards each other.
* In a neutral position, the hands do not impart any force other than the weight of the follower's hands in the leader's.

In swing dances, tension and compression may be maintained for a significant period of time.  In other dances, such as [[Ballroom dance|Latin]], tension and compression may be used as indications of upcoming movement.  However, in both styles, tension and compression do not signal immediate movement: the follow must be careful not to move prior to actual movement by the lead.  Until then, the dancers must match pressures without moving their hands.  In some styles of [[Lindy Hop]], the tension may become quite high without initiating movement.

The general rule for open connections is that moves of the leader's hands back, forth, left or right are originated through moves of the entire body. Accordingly, for the follower, a move of the connected hand is immediately transformed into the corresponding move of the body. Tensing the muscles and locking the arm achieves this effect but is neither comfortable nor correct. Such tension eliminates the subtler communication in the connection, and eliminates free movement up and down, such as is required to initiate many turns.

Instead of just tensing the arms, connection is achieved by engaging the shoulder, upper body and torso muscles. Movement originates in the body's core. A leader leads by moving himself and maintaining frame and connection. Different forms of dance and different movements within each dance may call for differences in the connection. In some dances the separation distance between the partners remains pretty constant. In others e.g. [[Modern Jive]] moving closer together and further apart are fundamental to the dance, requiring flexion and extension of the arms, alternating compression and tension.

The connection between two partners has a different feel in every dance and with every partner.  Good social dancers adapt to the conventions of the dance and the responses of their partners.

'''Caste''' is an elaborate and complex social system that combines elements of [[endogamy]], [[wikt:occupation|occupation]], [[culture]], [[social class]], [[Tribe|tribal affiliation]] and [[political power]]. It should not be confused with [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] or [[social class]], e.g. members of different castes in one [[society]] may belong to the same race. Usually, members of the same caste are of the same rank, occupation, and/or economic position, and typically have mores which distinguish it from similar groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caste&lt;/ref&gt; The word caste can also just generally refer to any rigid system of cultural or social distinctions&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caste&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Caste system in India|Indian society is often now associated with the word &quot;caste&quot;]], it was first used by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] to describe inherited class status in their own [[Europe]]an society. English ''caste'' is from [[Latin]] ''castus''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/28546 caste, n.]&quot;. Oxford English Dictionary. Accessed 3 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;pure, cut off, segregated&quot;, and is etymologically related to ''carere'' &quot;to cut off&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Raphael, ''Thealogy and embodiment:
the post-patriarchal reconstruction of female sacrality.'' Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1996. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; Application to [[Caste system in India|Indian social groups]] originates in the 17th century, via [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''casta'' &quot;breed, race, caste&quot;. This terminology has informed and greatly influenced the negative European view of caste. 

[[Discrimination]] based on caste, as perceived by [[UNICEF]], is prevalent mainly in parts of [[Asia]] (India, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Japan]]) and [[Africa]]. UNICEF estimates that such perceived discrimination based on caste affects 250 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], [[UNICEF]]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are an estimated 160 million [[Dalit]]s or [[Scheduled Castes]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/racism/010828.caste.html The Caste System]&quot;.

[[India]]n society has consisted since ancient times of several thousand tribal and occupational groups or communities called [[Jāti]]. The phrase &quot;Caste System&quot; conflates the reality and theory - the reality of the [[Jāti]] system prevalent throughout the Indian society since ancient times and the Varna (class/group),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-623520/varna varna, or Varna (Hinduism)]&lt;/ref&gt; theoretical scheme based on idealised{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[Brahmin]]ical traditions.

Faced with a confounding array of thousands of autonomous and hierarchically fluid communities (Jatis), the late 19th century British colonial administration decided to categorise and rank the entire [[Hindu]] population of India by placing each of the Jatis within the theoretical Varna scheme for the purposes of the decennial Census, and for eventual administrative and general use {{citation needed|date=August 2010}}. The 1901 Census was led by [[Herbert Hope Risley]], an ICS officer with racial beliefs about the Indian population, including the superiority of the Brahmins, whom he saw as descendants of the ancient [[Aryan]] invaders, in the light of then prevalent but flawed historical views. Simultaneous with this first ever codification into [[secular]] law of Varna-based caste identities, communities (Jatis) sought to place themselves on higher levels of Varna categories. On the other hand, most of the Jatis grouped into the lower caste categories rejected the Varna categories, as they found this arbitrary classification unreasonable, unfair and unacceptable. This newly frozen materialisation of caste created a growing resentment firstly against the system itself and secondly against the Brahmins, who were seen as the beneficiaries of an arrangement which now officially anointed their place at the top of the social hierarchy. The revolt of the Justice Party and [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and the eradication of caste|Periyar]] in the south, by the Maharaja of [[Kolhapur]] and Dr [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] in western India against this, in the early decades of the 20th century, has had a profound, long-lasting impact on the Indian society and politics, which continues to this day.

The forced melding of the ubiquitous [[Jati]] with the theoretical [[Varna]] categories by the British colonial power since 1901, has promoted a general and erroneous belief that the entire Indian society was grouped into the four ideal  [[Varna]] categories since time immemorial. Indian society has viewed this artificial rigidity with dismay and has been struggling with this flawed imposition ever since the beginning of the 20th century. To explain the continuance of the British imposition even after India's independence, it has been postulated that for the Indian politicians, as it was for the British colonial masters, this has proved to be a useful myth to promote, as it provides them with ready constituencies for which to claim a perpetual victim status and benefit from the divisions and votes this garners.

''The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950'' lists 1,108 castes  across 25 states in its First Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule3a.htm The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order 1950'' lists 744 tribes across 22 states in its First Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule9a.htm The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists, most prominently at the [[UN]] conference at [[Durban]], have asserted that the caste is a form of racial discrimination.[23][24] UNICEF estimates that some form of discrimination based on caste affects 250 million people in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], [[UNICEF]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been disputed by some sociologists such as Andre Béteille, who writes that treating caste as a form of racism is &quot;politically mischievous&quot; and worse, &quot;scientifically nonsense&quot; since there is no discernible difference in the racial characteristics between Brahmins and Scheduled Castes such as the Jatav. He writes that &quot;'Every social group cannot be regarded as a race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination.'&quot;[25]

The Indian government, too, has denied the claims of equivalence between caste and racial discrimination, pointing out that the issues of [[social status]] is essentially intra-racial and intra-cultural. The view of the caste system as ''&quot;static and unchanging&quot;'' is disappearing. The Indian government has been working towards creating equality between castes with affirmative action, such as guaranteed seats in educational institutions, government jobs (and promotions) and even in the parliament for those of the Scheduled Untouchable castes and tribes. Scholarships have also been available to all of these groups, so that they can go on to further education more easily and this has raised their social status. Sociologists describe how the perception of the caste system as a static and textual stratification has given way to the perception of the caste system as a more processional, empirical and contextual stratification. Others have applied theoretical models to explain mobility and flexibility in the caste system in India.[26] According to these scholars, groups of lower-caste individuals could seek to elevate the status of their caste by attempting to emulate the practices of higher castes. The eminent Socio-anthropologist M. N. Srinivas has also questioned the rigidity of caste and introduced the concept of Sanskritisation.[27][28].

==== Varna ====
{{See also|Varna in Hinduism}}
Early Indian texts like the Manusmriti and the Puranas speak of 'Varna,' which means order, type or colour. It groups the society into four idealised main types as follows.
Brahmins (scholars, teachers, priests)
Kshatriyas (warriors, kings, administrators)
Vaishyas (agriculturists, merchants)
Shudras (artisans, service providers)

All others who did not belong to this Hindu society, including foreigners, tribals and nomads were called Mlechhas and even those who had been excommunicated were called &quot;Anaryas&quot; (non-Aryans), were to be treated as contagious and untouchable barbarians. Its members feared banishment from society as a powerful disincentive against violating social norms. A late section of the Shanti Parva of the [[Mahabharata]] suggests an origin of this practice: ''&quot;He who becomes harsh in speech, or violent in temper, he who seduces or abducts other people's women or robs the wealth that belongs to others, should be cast off by us&quot;''.

The hypothetical system provided each group with its own niche, and few individuals were left without a distinct role. According to the Varna system, Brahmins are enjoined to live in poverty and their primary vocation was to learn the Vedas, sacred texts and secular subjects, teach others and pray for the well-being of all. The Kshatriya's chief occupation was martial skills, protection of civil society and governance. The Vaishyas were those occupied with trade, banking and agrarian activities including cattle raising, while the Sudras were other workers, craftsmen and service providers of all types. The reality of thousands of [[Jatis]] in the Indian society, which freely did what they pleased and had a variety of mixed roles, was explained away by the texts as having been the outcome of a pre-historical mixing of Varnas, or 'Varna Samkara'. All the Varnas were urged, without exception, to inculcate non-possessiveness, non-stealing, truthfulness, non-violence and benevolence. These too were the very attributes propounded by the [[Jain]] and [[Buddhist]] doctrines. It was believed by some that after death, people are reborn into a higher caste if they had led a moral life, or a lower caste if they led an immoral life. Thus, it was thought that those who served undesirable functions, like the untouchables, deserved their lot, because of their past [[Karma]].

As the historian [[Romila Thapar]] has pointed out in her 'The Past and Prejudice': &quot;The dynamic of Indian society was the juxtaposition of precept to practice, of the organisation of life as it should be, to the organisation of life as it is. For every aspect of life, from the most mundane to the most exhilarating, there was a theory of functioning which did not necessarily reflect the reality. The theory was the ideal image.....The resulting dichotomies were not forced into confrontation but were adjusted...Such adjustments seem easier in pre-industrial societies whose cultures invariably appear to be more gentle, meditative and less competitive,..&quot;

Although Brahmins have usually been described as the priestly class, this is not entirely accurate, as a temple priest need not have been a Brahmin, in fact very few could have been, given the vast number of temples and the sparse population of Brahmins; however, the performers of a Vedic Yajna for others or a public Yajna fire sacrifice usually were Brahmins. All the Dvija (Twice Born) i.e. Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas could and did perform the Homa fire sacrifice for themselves. Even this has not always been followed by all sects within Hinduism - for example, in the Arya Samaj, all castes including Shudras can perform the fire sacrifice. There were several categories among the Brahmins and temple priests, if any at all, were usually at the lowest end of the Brahmin social scale. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], e.g., Megasthenes in his Indika and the Muslims, e.g. Alberuni (1030 CE) described Brahmins as philosophers. Megasthenes calls them Brachmanes and characterises them thus:

&quot;The philosophers are first in rank, but form the smallest class in point of number. Their services are employed privately by persons who wish to offer sacrifices or perform other sacred rites, and also publicly by the kings at what is called the Great Synod, wherein at the beginning of the new year all the philosophers are gathered together before the king at the gates, when any philosopher who may have committed any useful suggestion to writing, or observed any means for improving the crops and the cattle, or for promoting the public interests, declares it publicly.&quot;

==== Jatis ====
{{See also|Jāti}}
Professor Madhav Gadgil (1983) has described the reality of self-governing, closed communities, which are called Jatis, in India, based on his research in rural Maharashtra: &quot;The Indian society is even today an agglomeration of numerous castes, tribes and religious communities. The tribal and caste groups are endogamous, reproductively isolated populations traditionally distributed over a restricted geographical range. The different caste populations, unlike tribes, have extensive geographical overlap and members of several castes generally constitute the complex village society. In such a village society, each caste, traditionally self regulated by a caste council, used to lead a relatively autonomous existence. Each caste used to pursue a hereditarily prescribed occupation; this was particularly true of the artisan and service castes and the pastoral and nomadic castes. The several castes were linked to each other through a traditionally determined barter of services and produce (Ghurye 1961, Karve 1961). These caste groups retained their identity even after conversion to Islam or Christianity. Each of the caste groups was thus the unit within which cultural and perhaps genetic evolution occurred, at least for the last 1500 years when the system was fully crystallized and probably much longer. Over this period the various castes had come to exhibit striking differences in cultural traits like skills possessed, food habits, dress, language, religious observances as well as in a number of genetic traits.&quot; [1]

In &quot;A New History of India,&quot; Stanley Wolpert states,&quot; a process of expansion, settled agricultural production and pluralistic integration of new people led to the development of India's uniquely complex system of social organisation by occupation....&quot;

Under the Jati system, a person is born into a Jati with ascribed social roles and endogamy, i.e. marriages take place only within that Jati. The Jati provided identity, security and status and has historically been open to change based on economic, social and political influences (see Sanskritization). In the course of early Indian history, various tribal, economic, political and social factors led to a continuous closing, consolidation and variation in the prevailing social ranks which tended to become traditional, hereditary system of social structuring. This system of thousands of exclusive, endogamous groups, is called Jāti. Though there were several kinds of variations across the breadth of India, the Jati was the effective community within which one married and spent most of one's personal life. Often it was the community (Jati) which provided support in difficult times, in old age and even in the resolution of disputes. It was thus the community which one also sought to promote.

The Untouchables - Pariahs or Antyajas, were at the bottom of the social scale and even now perform the jobs nobody else wants such as disposal of corpses, night soil handling or execution of criminals; They lived in their own ghettos at the peripheries of the towns and villages and were not allowed to read or hear holy books. It is, however, rather interesting that people of all Jatis across the spectrum, from the so-called upper castes to the lowest of castes, including the Untouchables, tended to avoid intermarriage, sharing of food and drinks, or even close social interaction with a Jati other than their own. Indeed, for some of them, for example the Tharu Boxas, even Brahmins were untouchable. Most of the Jati castes did not see themselves as socially inferior to the others in any way {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. If at all, it was the other way round {{citation needed|date=October 2010}} and many of them had folk narratives, traditions, myths and legends to bolster their sense of identity and cultural uniqueness.

An interesting perspective on ancient [[North India]]n society is provided by the Greek Megasthenes, who, in his Indika, described the society as being made up of &quot;seven castes&quot;:

&quot;The whole population of India is divided into seven castes, of which the first is formed by the collective body of the Philosophers, which in point of number is inferior to the other castes, but in point of dignity preeminent over all. For the philosophers, being exempted from all public duties, are neither the masters nor the servants of others. They are, however, engaged by private persons to offer the sacrifices due in lifetime, and to celebrate the obsequies of the dead: for they are believed to be most dear to the gods, and to be the most conversant with matters pertaining to [[Hades]]. In requital of such services they receive valuable gifts and privileges. To the people of India at large they also render great benefits, when, gathered together at the beginning of the year, they forewarn the assembled multitudes about droughts and wet weather, and also about propitious winds, and diseases, and other topics capable of profiting-the hearers. Thus the people and the sovereign, learning beforehand what is to happen, always make adequate provision against a coming deficiency, and never fail to prepare beforehand what will help in a time of need. The philosopher who errs in his predictions incurs no other penalty than obloquy, and he then observes silence for the rest of his life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balvihar-stlouis.com/uplFiles/linkFiles/Megasthenes.htm Mgasthenes's Indika], see section 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other classes are also described by Arrian, in The Anabasis Alexandrae, Book VIII: Indica (2nd c. CE) relying on the account of Megasthenes:

&quot;Then next to these come the farmers, these being the most numerous class of Indians; they have no use for warlike arms or warlike deeds, but they till the land; and they pay the taxes to the kings and to the cities, such as are self-governing; and if there is internal war among the Indians, they may not touch these workers, and not even devastate the land itself; but some are making war and slaying all comers, and others close by are peacefully ploughing or gathering the fruits or shaking down apples or harvesting.

The third class of Indians are the herdsmen, sheep and cattle pastoralists, and these dwell neither by cities nor in the villages. They are nomads and get their living on the hillsides, and they pay taxes from their animals; they hunt also birds and wild game in the country.

The fourth class is of artisans and shopkeepers; these are workers, and pay tribute from their works, save such as make weapons of war; these are paid by the community. In this class are the [[shipwright]]s and [[sailor]]s, who navigate the rivers.

The fifth class of Indians is the [[soldier]]s' class, next after the farmers in number; these have the greatest freedom and the most spirit. They practise military pursuits only. Their weapons others forge for them, and again others provide horses; others too serve in the camps, those who groom their horses and polish their weapons, guide the elephants, and keep in order and drive the chariots. They themselves, when there is need of war, go to war, but in time of peace they make merry; and they receive so much pay from the community that they can easily from their pay support others.

The sixth class of Indians are those called overseers. They oversee everything that goes on in the country or in the cities; and this they report to the king, where the Indians are governed by kings, or to the authorities, where they are independent. To these it is illegal to make any false report; nor was any Indian ever accused of such falsification.

The seventh class is those who deliberate about the community together with the king, or, in such cities as are self-governing, with the authorities. In number this class is small, but in wisdom and uprightness it bears the palm from all others; from this class are selected their governors, district governors and deputies, custodians of the treasures, officers of army and navy, financial officers and overseers of agricultural works.

The same man may not practise two pursuits; nor change from one class into another, as to turn farmer from shepherd, or shepherd from artisan. It is only permitted to join the wise men out of any class; for their business is not an easy one, but of all most laborious.&quot;

===Nepal===
{{Main|Nepalese caste system|Ethnicity and caste in Nepal}}
The [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles that of the Indian [[Jāti]] system with numerous Jāti divisions with a Varna system superimposed. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Lichchhavi period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–95) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–75). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–36).

===China===
The [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] showed such a high level of polarization between North and South that northerners and southerners referred to each other as barbarians. The [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty]] also made use of the concept; Yuan subjects were divided into four classes, with northern [[Han Chinese]] occupying the second-poorest class and southern Han Chinese the poorest one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/history/yuan/four-class-system.htm The 'Four Class System']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Yi people|Yi]] society in [[Yunnan]] was class based. People were split into the Black Yi (nobles, 5% of the population), White Yi (commoners), Ajia (33% of the Yi population) and the Xiaxi (10%). Ajia and Xiaxi were slaves. The White Yi were not slaves but had no freedom of movement. The Black Yi made slave-raids on [[Han Chinese]] communities. After 1959, some 700,000 slaves were freed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-67665/Black-Bone-Yi Black Bone Yi (people)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yi.peoples.org/learn/profiles/general.htm General Profile of the Yi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-2-yi.htm The Yi ethnic minority]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===

The two main classes in Japan were [[samurai]] and peasants. Only the samurai class was allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasant whom he felt was disrespectful.

Japan historically subscribed to a feudal class system. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the [[Buraku]] or [[Burakumin]] underclasses, historically referred to by the insulting term ''Eta''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF39.htm Class, Ethnicity and Nationality: Japan Finds Plenty of Space for Discrimination&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Burakumin are regarded as &quot;ostracised.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

===Korea===
{{See also|Baekjeong}}
The ''Baekjeong'' were an &quot;[[untouchable (social system)|untouchable]]&quot; minority group of [[Korea]]. The term ''baekjeong'' literally means &quot;a butcher&quot;, but later changed into &quot;common citizens&quot; to change the class system so that the system would be without untouchables. In the early part of the [[Goryeo]] period (918-1392), these minority groups were largely settled in fixed communities. However, the [[Mongol]] invasion left Korea in disarray and [[anomie]], and these groups became [[nomad]]ic. Other subgroups of the baekjeong are the ''chaein'' and the ''hwachae''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} During the Joseon dynasty, they were specific professions like basket weaving and performing executions.

With the unification of the [[Three kingdoms of Korea|three kingdoms]] in the 7th century and the foundation of the [[Goryeo dynasty]] in the [[Middle Ages]], Koreans systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]] that literally means &quot;two classes.&quot; It was composed of scholars (Munban) and warriors (Muban). Within the Yangban class, the Scholars (Munban) enjoyed a significant social advantage over the warrior (Muban) class, until the Muban Rebellion in 1170. Muban ruled Korea under successive Warrior Leaders until the Mongol Conquest in 1253. In 1392, with the foundation of [[Joseon dynasty]], the full ascendancy of munban over muban was final.

Beneath the Yangban class were the ''Jung-in''. They were the technicians. This class was small and specialised. Beneath the Jung-in were the Sangmin also called ''Ssangnom'' in the vernacular. These were the servant class. Beneath the Sangmin were the Chunmin. They were the landless peasants. These people composed the majority of Korean society until the 17th century. Underneath them all were the Baekjeong. The meaning today is that of butcher. They originate from the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. Korea had a very large [[slave]] population, ''nobi'', ranging from a third to half of the entire population for most of the millennium between the [[Silla]] period and the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. [[Slavery]] was legally abolished in Korea in 1894 but remained extant in reality until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Encyclopædia Britannica - Slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/03.22/35-mm.html Edward Willett Wagner - The Harvard University Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/snu/ioerwp/no26.html Korean Nobi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''; However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and protests erupted when missionaries attempted to integrate them into worship services, with non-''baekjeong'' finding such an attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Also around the same time, the baekjeong began to resist the open social discrimination that existed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=0674005945}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on social and economic injustices affecting the baekjeong, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by the upper class, authorities, and &quot;commoners&quot; and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|year=2003|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. However, the Yangban families carried on traditional education and formal mannerisms into the 20th century. With the democratisation of 1990s in [[South Korea]], remnant of such mannerisms and classism is now heavily frowned upon in the South Korean society, replaced by a belief in egalitarianism. However in [[North Korea]], there is still a class system.

===Hawaii ===

[[Ancient Hawaii]] was a class-based society. People were born into specific social classes; [[social mobility]] was not unknown, but it was extremely rare. The main classes were:

* '''[[Ali'i|Alii]]''', the royal suuwop class. This class consisted of the high and lesser chiefs of the realms. They governed with divine power called ''[[mana]]''.
* '''[[Kahuna]]''', the priestly and professional class. Priests conducted religious ceremonies, at the ''[[heiau]]'' and elsewhere. Professionals included master carpenters and boat builders, chanters, dancers, genealogists and physicians and healers.
* '''[[Maka'ainana|Makaāinana]]''', the commoner class. Commoners farmed, fished and exercised the simpler crafts. They laboured not only for themselves and their families, but to support the chiefs and kahuna.
* '''Kauwa''', the outcast or slave class. They are believed to have been war captives, or the descendants of war captives. Marriage between higher classes and the kauwa was strictly forbidden. The kauwa worked for the chiefs and were often used as human sacrifices at the ''[[luakini]] heiau''. (They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all classes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythichawaii.com/hawaiian-culture-society.htm Kapu System and Class System of Ancient Hawai'i]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
{{Main|Castas}}
The [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonists of the Americas instituted a relatively loose system of racial and social stratification and segregation based on a person's heritage. The system remained in place in most areas of [[Spanish America]] up to the time independence was achieved from Spain. Classes were used to identify people with specific racial or ethnic heritage. However, privileges or restrictions were more related to race and wealth than to a clearly defined system of classes.

Among the racial classifications used then in Spanish America are: [[Peninsular]], [[Criollo people|Criollo]], [[Castizo]], [[Mestizo]], [[Cholo]], [[Mulato]], [[Indio]], [[Zambo]] and [[Negro]].

==Africa==
{{Main|Caste system in Africa}}

Countries in [[Africa]] who have societies with class systems within their borders include [[Algeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mauritius]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Somalia]].

===West Africa===
In [[West Africa]], the ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the &quot;Osus&quot; people as &quot;owned by deities&quot; and outcasts.
The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders. At the bottom were war captives and European slaves obligated to labor. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.africankingdoms.com African Kingdoms Songhai Class System&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have class systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] class system in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions.

===Central Africa===
Class systems in [[Central Africa]] include the ''ubuhake'' classes in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

===East Africa===
The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, where the Watta, an acculturated [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] group, represent the poorest class.

The traditionally [[nomad]]ic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] are sometimes treated as outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;I.

===North Africa===
Class systems in [[North Africa]] include the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg social stratification]].

Sahrawi-Moorish society in [[Northwest Africa]] was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified into several tribal classes, with the [[Hassane]] warrior tribes ruling and extracting tribute - [[horma]] - from the subservient [[Znaga]] tribes. Although lines were blurred by intermarriage and tribal re-affiliation, the Hassane were considered descendants of the [[Arab]] [[Maqil]] tribe [[Beni Hassan]], and held power over [[Sanhadja]] [[Berber people|Berber]]-descended [[zawiya]] (religious) and [[znaga]] (servant) tribes. The so-called [[Haratin]] lower class, largely sedentary [[oasis]]-dwelling [[Black African|black]] people, have been considered natural slaves in Sahrawi-Moorish society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law] by [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Collegiate Shag''' (or &quot;Shag&quot;) is a [[partner dance]] done primarily to upper tempo jazz music (usually 200+ [[beats per minute]]). It belongs to the [[swing dancing|swing]] family of American vernacular dances that arose in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s.

==Name==
&quot;Shag&quot; itself (when used in reference to American social dances) is a very broad term used to denote a number of swing dances that originated during the early part of the 20th century. [[Arthur Murray]] mentioned Shag in his 1937 book &quot;Let's Dance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Let's Dance. Arthur Murray. 1937. Standard Brands Incorporated. page 27. No ISBN in this &quot;booklet&quot;, which appears to have been sold by mail. &quot;Can people really learn to dance from printed lessons?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This article states that shag was known throughout the entire country under various names, like &quot;Flea Hop&quot;. A New York writer sent to Tulsa, Oklahoma in late 1940/early 1941 noted an &quot;...Oklahoma version of shag done to the [[Western Swing]] music of [[Bob Wills]] and his Texas Playboys at the Cain's Dancing Academy in Tulsa.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. page 198. ISBN 0-252-00470-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the term &quot;Collegiate Shag&quot; is most often used in reference to a kind of double shag (see explanation below) that is believed to have originated in New York during the 1930s. To call the dance &quot;collegiate shag&quot; was not as common during the swing era as it is today, but when it was used (as it was with other vernacular dances of the time) it was meant to indicate the style of the dance that was popular amongst the college crowd. This name later became somewhat standard in the latter part of the 20th century (see [[swing revival]]), presumably because it helped to distinguish the dance from other contemporary dances that share the &quot;shag&quot; designation (e.g., [[Carolina Shag]]).

==History==
Shag has no clear historical record but is often assumed, as with many other swing dances, to have evolved from [[Foxtrot]]. In the late 19th century the term &quot;shagger&quot; was supposedly a nickname for vaudeville performers [http://dancehistory.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=8&amp;p=2830&amp;hilit=Shagger#p2830], who were known to dance the Flea Hop. Later &quot;shag&quot; became a blanket term that signified a broad range of jitterbugging (swing dancing). In the 1930s there were arguably a hundred or more stylistic variations of the dance, which differed depending upon geographic region. These stylistic variations were later generalized into three rhythmic categories: single, double, and triple shag. The different names are intended to denote the number of 'slow' (e.g., step, hop) steps performed during each basic. The slow steps were then followed by two 'quick' steps (e.g., step, step). 

The dance is still performed today (primarily double shag) by swing dance enthusiasts worldwide.

==Moves==
Described below is double shag, which uses a 'slow, slow, quick, quick' rhythm. The basic step has six counts. 

''Shag Position'': the man's left arm is held straight up with his left elbow touching the woman's right elbow. Her arm should be fully or almost fully extended overhead as well. This was not always practiced, but it is understood to be one of the features that make collegiate shag unique. Some dancers prefer to hold the arms much lower, similar to conventional ballroom positioning. The follow's footwork usually mirrors the lead's. The basic step is danced in a face-to-face (&quot;closed&quot;) but staggered position (i.e., the lead and follow are chest to chest, but their orientation to one another is offset in such a way that the feet are not toe-to-toe but alternate, like the teeth of a zipper).

Note: '''Step''' (in the description below) is defined as: ''a transfer/change of weight to the opposite foot while hopping'' (this is usually very minimal; almost more of a scoot than a literal hop). '''Hop''' is defined as: ''a lift-and-plant motion on the same foot.'' '''Planted foot''' ''is the foot with the dancer's weight on it''

*''Basic'': (from the lead's point-of-view) Beat 1: STEP onto left foot, beat 2: HOP on left, beat 3: STEP onto right foot, beat 4: HOP on right, beat 5: STEP onto left foot, and beat 6: STEP onto right foot. The movement during beats 5 and 6 is often described as a shuffling motion. As mentioned above, this is usually broken down verbally as &quot;slow, slow; quick, quick&quot; where the 'slows' cover two beats (or 'counts') each and the 'quicks' mark a single beat (or 'count') each. Hence, for the lead this would be two counts with the weight on the left leg while the right leg moves, two counts with weight on the right leg while the left leg moves, followed by a quick step onto the left and then a quick step onto the right.  The follow's movement would be the exact opposite.

*''Camel kicks'': (done with the partners positioned side-by-side) the same movement as the basic but where the non-planted foot kicks on each slow, and where the quick-quicks are done with one foot behind the other (in tandem).
*''Breaks'': A step and hold action where the non-planted leg is extended fully and the planted leg is bent underneath the dancer for support (hop onto left, leaving out the step; hop onto right, leave out the step; step left and step right)
*''Turns'': the follow can be turned with an overhead, a free, or an Apache turn on the slows or the quicks-quicks (to do so on the quick-quick is considered more traditional)

'''CORAL''' ('''C'''omputer '''O'''n-line '''R'''eal-time '''A'''pplications '''L'''anguage) is a [[programming language]] originally developed in 1964 at the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] (RRE), [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], as a [[subset]] of [[JOVIAL]]. Coral 66 was subsequently developed by I. F. Currie and M. Griffiths. Its official definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Definition of CORAL 66 |last=Woodward |first=P.M. |publisher=HMSO|date=1970 |pages=vii+58 |isbn=0114702217}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Woodward, Wetherall and Gorman, was first published in 1970.

Coral 66 is a general-purpose programming language based on [[ALGOL 60]], with some features from Coral 64, JOVIAL, and [[Fortran|FORTRAN]]. It includes structured record types (as in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and supports the packing of data into limited storage (also as in Pascal). Like [[Edinburgh IMP]] it allows embedded assembler, and also offers good run-time checking and diagnostics. It is specifically intended for [[real-time computing|real-time]] applications and for use on computers with limited processing power, including those limited to [[fixed point arithmetic]] and those without support for dynamic storage allocation.

The language was an inter-service standard for British military programming, and was also widely adopted for civil purposes in the British control and automation industry. It was used to write software for both the [[Ferranti]] and [[The General Electric Company|GEC]] computers from 1971 onwards.  Implementations also exist for the Interdata 8/32, [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] platforms and [[HP Integrity]] servers; for the [[Honeywell]], and for the Computer Technology Limited (CTL, later ITL) Modular-1; as well as for [[SPARC]] running [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Intel]] running [[Linux]].

A variant of Coral 66 was developed during the late 1970s/early 1980s by the British [[General Post Office|GPO]], in conjunction with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], STC and [[Plessey]], for use on the [[System X (telephony)|System X]] digital telephone exchange control computers, known as PO-CORAL. This was later renamed BT-CORAL when [[British Telecom]] was spun off from the Post Office. Unique features of this language were the focus on real-time execution, message processing, limits on statement execution between waiting for input, and a prohibition on recursion to remove the need for a stack.

As Coral was aimed at a variety of real-time work, rather than general office DP, it was not thought to require any standardised equivalent to a [[stdio]] library. This made life difficult for newcomers to the language, and producing a mere [[Hello world program|Hello World]] was no mean achievement.

Source code for a Coral 66 compiler (written in [[BCPL]]) has been recovered and the &quot;Official Definition of Coral 66&quot; document by [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] has been scanned; the Ministry of Defence patent office has issued a licence to the Edinburgh Computer History project to allow them to put both the code and the language reference online for non-commercial use.

'''Rhyming slang''' is a form of phrase construction in the [[English language]], and is especially prevalent in dialectal [[British English]] from the [[East End of London|East End]] of [[London]] which also gives it the name '''Cockney rhyming slang'''. The construction involves replacing the common word with a phrase of two or three words, and then in almost all cases, omitting the original rhyming word, in a process called hemiteleia,&lt;ref name =&quot;roberts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=mother&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue|publisher=Penguin|year=1990|isbn=0-140-14305-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to unfamiliar listeners.&lt;ref name=&quot;ayto&quot;/&gt;

The most frequently cited example, although it is almost never said by current users,&lt;ref name=mother/&gt; involves the replacement of &quot;stairs&quot; with the rhyming &quot;apples and pears&quot;; following the usual pattern of omission this would then be used only as &quot;apples&quot;. Thus the spoken phrase &quot;I'm going up the apples&quot; would indicate &quot;I'm going ['up the stairs'/'upstairs']&quot;. 

In similar fashion, &quot;telephone&quot; is indicated by &quot;dog&quot; (= 'dog-and-bone'); &quot;wife&quot; by &quot;trouble&quot; (= 'trouble-and-strife'); &quot;eyes&quot; by &quot;minces&quot; (= 'mince pies'); &quot;wig&quot; by &quot;syrup&quot; (= 'syrup of fig&quot;), and &quot;feet&quot; by &quot;plates&quot; (= 'plates of meat'). Thus a construction of the following type could conceivably arise: ''&quot;It nearly knocked me off me plates: he was wearing a syrup! So I got straight on the dog to me trouble, and said I couldn't believe me minces...&quot;.'' 

In some prominent examples, the meaning is further obscured by adding a further iteration of rhyme and truncation to the originally rhymed phrase.  For example, the word &quot;Aris&quot; is often used to indicate the buttocks.  This has been subject to a double rhyme, starting with the original word &quot;arse&quot;, which was subsequently rhymed with &quot;bottle and glass&quot;, making &quot;bottle&quot; the slang term.  &quot;Bottle&quot; was then [[Bruces' Philosophers Song|rhymed with &quot;Aristotle&quot;]] and truncated to &quot;Aris&quot;.&lt;ref name=mother/&gt;

The use of rhyming slang has gone beyond pure dialectal use and some words have made their way in to the mainstream British English lexicon, although many users may be unaware of the origin.  One example is the word &quot;berk&quot; a mild pejorative, widely used across the UK, and not usually considered particularly offensive, although the rhyming slang origin is as a contraction of &quot;[[Berkeley Hunt]]&quot;, as the rhyme of the significantly more offensive &quot;[[cunt]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Reference Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is possible to think of the adjective, 'bales (of cotton)' that is to say, 'rotten', or the adjectival phrase 'on one's tod ([[Tod Sloan (jockey)|Sloan]])' — 'on one's own', the vast majority of the rhymed words are nouns.

==History==

Rhyming slang is believed to have originated in the mid-19th century in the [[East End]] of [[London]], with sources suggesting some time in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric. Dictionary of Historical Slang. Penguin, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hott&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotten|first=John Camden|title=A dictionary of modern slang, cant, and vulgar words|pages=133–136|chapter=Some account of the Rhyming Slang, the secret language of Chaunters and Patterers|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zhk9h-w1negC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+Modern+Slang,+Cant+and+Vulgar+Words&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | year=1859 | publisher=John Camden Hotten}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vicweb&quot;/&gt; 

According to Partridge (1972:12), it dates from around 1840 among the predominantly Cockney population of the East End of London who are well-known for having a characteristic accent and speech patterns. [[John Camden Hotten]] in his 1859 ''Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant and Vulgar Words'' states that (English) rhyming slang originated in the 1840s (&quot;about twelve or fifteen years ago&quot;) with 'chaunters' and 'patterers' (each a kind of travelling salesman; chaunters sold sheet music and patterers sold cheap tawdry goods at fairs and markets up and down the country) in the [[Seven Dials]] area of [[Westminster]]. His ''Dictionary'' included a &quot;Glossary of the Rhyming Slang&quot;, the first known such work, which included later mainstays such as &quot;Frog and toad, the main road&quot; and &quot;Apples and pears, stairs&quot;, as well as many that later grew more obscure, e.g. &quot;Battle of the Nile, a tile - vulgar term for a hat&quot;, &quot;Duke of York, take a walk&quot;, and &quot;Top of Rome, home&quot;.

It remains a matter of speculation whether rhyming slang was a linguistic accident, a game, or a [[cryptolect]] developed intentionally to confuse non-locals. If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community. It is possible that it was used in the marketplace to allow vendors to talk amongst themselves in order to facilitate [[collusion]], without customers knowing what they were saying. Another suggestion is that it may have been used by criminals ''(see [[thieves' cant]])'' to confuse the police.

An introduction to rhyming slang is found in ''Up the frog: the road to Cockney rhyming slang'', by Sydney Thomas Kendall.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 978-0723401384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
At any point in time, rhyming slang incorporates words and phrases that are relevant at that particular time and in that particular place. Many examples are based on places in London and could be meaningless to people unfamiliar with the capital, e.g. &quot;[[Peckham Rye]]&quot;, meaning &quot;tie&quot; (as in necktie), which dates from the late 19th century; &quot;[[Hampstead Heath]]&quot;, meaning &quot;teeth&quot; (usually as &quot;Hampsteads”), which was first recorded in 1887; and &quot;[[Barnet Fair]]&quot; meaning &quot;hair&quot;, which dates from the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ayto&quot; /&gt; 

By the mid-20th century many rhyming slang expressions used the names of contemporary personalities, especially actors and performers: for example &quot;[[Gregory Peck]]&quot; (an actor) meaning &quot;neck&quot; and also &quot;cheque&quot;; &quot;[[Ruby Murray]]&quot; (an Irish singer) meaning &quot;curry&quot;; &quot;Alans&quot;, meaning &quot;knickers&quot; from [[Alan Whicker]] (a British television personality); &quot;[[Max_Miller_(comedian)|Max Miller]]&quot; meaning &quot;pillow&quot; when pronounced /ˈpilə/ ''q.v.'' (after a mildly risqué British comedian), and &quot;Henry Halls&quot; meaning &quot;balls&quot; (as in testicles ''q.v.'') after British bandleader [[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Hall]].

By the late 20th century the use of personal names as rhymes continued with such examples as &quot;[[Tony Blairs]]&quot; (usually as &quot;Tonys&quot;) after the British prime minister to mean &quot;flares&quot; as in trousers with a wide bottom; previously this was &quot;[[Lionel Blair]]s&quot; (after a British dancer) identifying the mutative nature of the form; and &quot;[[Britney Spears]]&quot; (usually as &quot;Britneys&quot;) meaning &quot;beers&quot; as in &quot;Let’s get a round of Britneys&quot;.

Many examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in Britain in their contracted form. &quot;To have a butcher's&quot;, meaning to have a look, originates from &quot;[[butcher]]'s hook&quot; (an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat), and dates from the late 19th century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as &quot;butchers&quot;. Similarly, &quot;use your loaf&quot;, meaning &quot;use your head&quot;, derives from &quot;loaf of [[bread]]&quot; and also dates from the late 19th century but came into independent use in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ayto&quot; /&gt; It is likely that many people who use these terms today are unaware of their origin.

The reverse situation occurs with the term &quot;barney&quot;, which has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century although without a clear derivation.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge,Eric, A concise dictionary of slang and unconventional English. Routledge, 1991:22. (ISBN 0-415-06352-3)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Beatles Movie “A Hard Days Night” John Lennon taunts the road manager into “having a barney”.&lt;ref&gt;Movie, “A Hard Day’s Night” United Artists, Miramax Films, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2001 feature film ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' a character uses the term &quot;barney&quot;, which is claimed to be a rhyme derived from &quot;Barney Rubble&quot; meaning trouble. However, the use of &quot;barney&quot; in this context far precedes the ''[[Flintstones]]'' cartoon character [[Barney Rubble]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/13/messages/932.html Re: Having a barney]&lt;/ref&gt; and its usage in the movie in a way that is dependent on a 1960s cartoon to get to the meaning of &quot;trouble&quot; is a good example of the ever-changing nature of rhyming slang.

== Regional variations ==
Rhyming slang is used mainly in London in England, but can be understood across the country. Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work. The term &quot;Charing Cross&quot; for example (a place in London) has been used to mean &quot;horse&quot; since the mid-19th century&lt;ref name=&quot;ayto&quot; /&gt; but does not rhyme unless &quot;cross&quot; is pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈkrɔːs|}} to rhyme with &quot;course&quot;. A similar example is &quot;Joanna&quot; meaning &quot;piano&quot;, which is based on the pronunciation of &quot;piano&quot; as &quot;pianna&quot; {{IPA-en|piˈænə|}}). Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed &quot;Derby Road&quot;, which rhymes with &quot;cold&quot;, a conjunction that would not be possible elsewhere in the UK.

Outside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries. In Australian slang the term for an English person is &quot;[[Alternative words for British#Pommy|pommy]]&quot;, which has been proposed as a rhyme on &quot;pomegranate&quot; rhyming with &quot;immigrant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites a well-known Australian weekly, ''[[The Bulletin]]'', which on 14 November 1912 reported: &quot;The other day a Pummy Grant (assisted immigrant) was handed a bridle and told to catch a horse.&quot; [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50183640?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=pomegranate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10  Online Oxford English Dictionary entry for &quot;Pomegranate&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge,Eric, A concise dictionary of slang and unconventional English. Routledge,1991:342. (ISBN 0-415-06352-3)&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent Australian invention is the term &quot;reginalds&quot; to describe underpants, from &quot;Reg Grundies&quot; after [[Reg Grundy]], the Australia media tycoon. In Australia and South Africa, the colloquial term &quot;China&quot; is derived from &quot;mate&quot; rhyming with &quot;China plate&quot; (the identical form, heard in expressions like &quot;me old China&quot; is also a long-established Cockney idiom).

In the United States the common slang expression &quot;brass tacks&quot; may be a rhyme for &quot;facts&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The term &quot;blow a raspberry&quot;, meaning to make a noise through the mouth with the tongue protruding, is also believed to be of American origin and probably comes from &quot;raspberry tart&quot; to rhyme with &quot;fart&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Rhyming slang and taboo terms==
Rhyming slang is often used as a substitute for words regarded as taboo, often to the extent that the association with the taboo word becomes unknown over time. &quot;[[Wiktionary:berk|Berk]]&quot; (often used to mean &quot;foolish person&quot;) originates from the most famous of all [[fox hunting|fox hunts]], the  &quot;[[Berkeley Hunt]]&quot; meaning &quot;cunt&quot;; &quot;[[Wiktionary:cobblers|cobblers]]&quot; (often used in the context &quot;what you said is rubbish&quot;) originates from &quot;[[Stitching awl|cobbler's awls]]&quot;, meaning &quot;balls&quot; (as in testicles); and &quot;hampton&quot; meaning &quot;prick&quot; (as in penis) originates from &quot;[[Hampton Wick]]&quot; (a place in London).

Lesser taboo terms include &quot;[[pony]] and [[trap]]&quot; for &quot;crap&quot; (as in defecate, but often used to denote nonsense or low quality); &quot;[[D'Oyly Carte]]&quot; for &quot;fart&quot;; &quot;Jimmy Riddle&quot; for &quot;piddle&quot; (as in [[urinate]]), and &quot;[[J. Arthur Rank]]&quot; (a film mogul) for &quot;[[wank (sexual act)|wank]]&quot;. &quot;Taking the Mickey (Bliss)&quot; is thought to be a rhyming slang form of &quot;taking the piss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jUkMbR9n8FAJ:www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/whoweretheyextras.shtml+mickey+bliss&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;source=www.google.co.uk &quot;Who Were They? - Tricky Verdicts&quot;,
from Balderdash and Piffle, BBC, August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhyming slang terms for [[Jew]] have included &quot;[[Chelsea Football Club|Chelsea Blue]]&quot;, &quot;[[Glue|Stick of Glue]]&quot;, &quot;[[dimensional lumber|Four by Two]]&quot; and &quot;[[Shoemaking|Buckle my shoe]]&quot;.

==Rhyming slang in popular culture==

Rhyming slang is used, then described and a number of examples are suggested as part of dialog in one scene of the 1967 film ''[[To Sir With Love]]'' starring [[Sidney Poitier]]. The English students are telling their foreign teacher that the slang is a drag and something for old people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSFoY3W3NM To Sir With Love] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain rhyming slang had a resurgence of popular interest beginning in the 1970s resulting from its use in a number of London-based television programmes such as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', ''[[Mind Your Language]]'', ''[[The Sweeney]]'' (the title of which is itself rhyming slang – &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; for &quot;[[Flying Squad]]&quot;, a rapid response unit of London’s Metropolitan Police), ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]],&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Brian, The Phenomenon that was Minder. Chameleon Press, 2002 (ISBN 962-86812-1-4)&lt;/ref&gt; '' ''[[Citizen Smith]]'', ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and ''[[EastEnders]]''. ''Minder'' could be quite uncompromising in its use of obscure forms without any clarification. Thus the non-Cockney viewer was obliged to deduce that, say, &quot;iron&quot; was &quot;male homosexual&quot; ('iron' = 'iron hoof' = 'poof'). One episode in Series 5 of ''Steptoe and Son'' was entitled &quot;Any Old Iron&quot;, for the same reason, when Albert thinks that Harold is 'on the turn'. 

In ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'', a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids' = 'kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...). 

In modern literature, Cockney rhyming slang is used frequently in the novels and short stories of [[Kim Newman]], for instance in the short story collections &quot;The Man from the Diogenes Club&quot; (2006) and &quot;Secret Files of the Diogenes Club&quot; (2007), where it is explained at the end of each book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/sherlock/shamblesinbelgravia1.shtml Shambles in Belgravia] BBC Cult&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular music, London-based artists such as [[Audio Bullys]] and [[Chas &amp; Dave]] (and others from elsewhere in the UK, such as [[The Streets]], who are from Birmingham) frequently use rhyming slang in their songs. The UK punk scene of the late 1970s introduced bands that glorified their working-class heritage: [[Sham 69]] had a hit song &quot;The Cockney Kids are Innocent&quot;. The idiom made a brief appearance in the UK-based DJ reggae music of the 1980s in the hit &quot;Cockney Translation&quot; by [[Smiley Culture]] of [[South London]]; this was followed a couple of years later by Domenick and Peter Metro's &quot;Cockney and Yardie&quot;. The 1967 [[Kinks]] song &quot;Harry Rag&quot; was based on the usage of the name [[Harry Wragg]] as rhyming slang for &quot;fag&quot; (i.e. a cigarette).

In movies, Cary Grant's character teaches rhyming slang to his female companion in the film ''[[Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky]]'' (1943) and describes it as Australian rhyming slang. The closing song of the 1969 [[Michael Caine]] crime caper, ''[[The Italian Job]]'', (&quot;Getta Bloomin' Move On&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Self Preservation Society&quot;) contains many slang terms. In present day feature films rhyming slang is often used to lend authenticity to an East End setting. Examples include ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998) (wherein the slang is translated via subtitles in one scene); ''[[The Limey]]'' (1999); ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000); ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000); ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001); and ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002); ''[[It's All Gone Pete Tong]]'' (2004), after BBC radio disc jockey [[Pete Tong]] whose name is used in this context as rhyming slang for &quot;wrong&quot;; ''[[Green Street Hooligans]]'' (2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Touro Canchim REFON .jpg|thumb|A Canchim bull]]
The '''Canchim breed''' is a breed of [[beef cattle]] developed in Central [[Brazil]] by crossing European [[Charolais cattle]] with [[Indo-Brazilian|Indubrazil cattle]] already kept in Brazil where Asian [[Zebu]] type cattle are best suited to the tropical conditions. When compared with Zebu bulls, Canchim bulls produce the same number of calves, but heavier and of superior quality. Compared to European breeds, the Canchim bull produces calves with the same weight but in larger numbers. The fast growing progeny, from crossbred zebu cows with Canchim bulls, can be slaughtered at 18 months old from feedlots after weaning, up to 24 months old from feedlots after grazing and at 30 months from grazing on the range. 

==Origin==
Zebu cattle (Bos Indicus), introduced to Brazil in the last century, were extensively crossbred with herds of native cattle. The Indian breed, well known for its ability to survive in the tropics, adapted quickly to Brazil, and soon populated large areas, considerably improving Brazilian beef cattle breeding. Zebu cattle were however found to be inferior to the European breeds in growth rate and yield of meat. It became clear that the beef cattle population required genetic improvement. Simply placing European beef cattle (Bos Taurus), highly productive in [[temperate climates]], in Central Brazil, would not produce good results, due to their inability to adapt to a [[tropical]] environment. Besides the climate, other factors such as the high occurrence of [[parasitism|parasites]], diseases and the very low nutritional value of the native forage were problems.

==Formation of the breed==
The European breed used in the formation of Canchim cattle was Charolais.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/canchim/index.htm Oklahoma State University breed profile]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 the Ministry of Agriculture imported Charolais cattle to the State of [[Goias]], where they remained till 1936, when they were transferred to [[São Carlos]] in the State of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], to the Canchim Farm of the Government Research Station, [[EMBRAPA]]. From this herd originated the dams and sires utilised in the program of crossbreeding.

The main Zebu breed which contributed to the formation to the Canchim was the Indubrazil, although Guzerá and [[Nelore]] cattle where also used. Preference was given to the Indubrasil breed, due to the ease of obtaining large herds at reasonable prices, which would have been difficult with [[Gir cattle|Gir]], Nelore or Guzerá.

The alternative crossbreeding programs initiated in 1940 by Dr. Antonio Teixeira Viana had the objective of obtaining first, crossbreeds 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu and second, 3/8 Charolais x 5/8 Zebu, to evaluate which of the two was the most successful. The total number of Zebu cows utilized to produce the half-breeds was 368, of which 292 were Indubrasil, 44 Guzerá and 32 Nelore. All the animals produced were reared exclusively on the range. Control of parasites was done every 15 days and the animals were weighed at birth and monthly. The females were weighed up to 30 months and the males up to 40 months.
The data collected during various years of work, permitted an evaluation of the various degrees of crossbreeding. The conclusion was that the 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu was the most suitable, presenting an excellent frame for meat, precocious, resistance to heat and parasites, and a uniform coat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embrapa.gov.br/english/portfolio/animal%20prod/canchim/ EMBRAPA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The first crossbred animals, 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu, were born in 1953. Thus was born a new type of beef cattle for Central Brazil, with the name CANCHIM, derived from the name of a tree very common in the region where the breed was developed. It was not until 1971 that the Brazilian Association of Canchim Cattle Breeders (ABCCAN) was formed, and on 11 November 1972 the Herd Book was initiated. On 18 May 1983 the Ministry of Agriculture, recognized Canchim type cattle as a Breed.

==New bloodlines==
The Canchim breed, being a synthetic breed, permits breeders, in the development of new crossbreeding systems, to use the breeds used to form the Canchim breed, besides the breed itself, in its development.

There are many Canchim breeders forming new blood lines. Today the Nelore breed totally dominates the Zebu breed in the formation of Canchim. American and French Charolais semen, from carefully selected bulls is also used and recommended by the ABCCAN to form new bloodlines.

      <comment>/* List of Central Committees */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Central Committee''' was the common designation of a standing administrative body of [[Communist party|communist parties]], analogous to a [[board of directors]],  whether ruling or non-ruling in the twentieth century and of the surviving, mostly [[Stalinist]], states in the early twenty first. In such party organizations the committee would typically be made up of delegates elected at a [[party congress]]. In those [[communist state|state]]s where it constituted the state power, the Central Committee made decisions for the party between congresses, and usually was responsible for electing the [[Politburo]]. In non-ruling Communist parties, the Central Committee is usually understood by the party membership to be the ultimate decision-making [[authority]] between Congresses once the process of [[democratic centralism]] has led to an agreed-upon position.

Organizations besides Communist ones also have Central Committees, such as the [[Mennonite Central Committee|Mennonite Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcc.org Menonite Central Committee] web site&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], as well as the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors (to [[war]]). In the United States the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Parties both have Central Committees; these act as the leading body of those organizations at the national/administrative level, as well as local committees in a similar capacity within the local Democratic or Republican governments of individual [[county (US)|counties]] and states.

{{Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}

The '''Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Центральный комитет Коммунистической партии Советского Союза - ЦК КПСС, ''Tsentralniy Komitet Kommunistitcheskoi Partii Sovetskogo Soyuza - TsK KPSS''), abbreviated in Russian as '''ЦК''', &quot;Tse-ka&quot;, earlier was also called as the '''Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)''' (TsK VKP(b)) was the highest body of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). According to Party rules, the Central Committee directed all Party and government activities between each [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]]. Members of the committee were elected at the Party Congress every five years.

The [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] was elected by and reporting to the Central Committee. Besides the Politburo the Central Committee also elected the Secretaries of the Central Committee which comprised the [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee]]. The Central Committee elected the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the CPSU]] as well. In 1919-1952 the [[Orgburo]] was also elected in the same manner as the Politburo and the Secretariat by the plenums of the Central Committee.

For most of its existence, the power of the Central Committee was limited by its infrequent meetings and large membership, and true power lay with the Politburo. The Committee functioned as a rubber-stamp to legitimise and give an aura of consensus to Politburo decisions. The Committee would meet only twice a year, with sessions lasting one or two days. Special plenary sessions would be held before a major event, such as a new long-term plan or the selection of a new General Secretary. The elections were façades too, with the membership being selected in advance by the leaders.

From 1917 to 1934, the Central Committee acted more or less as a &quot;parliament&quot; where political discussions took place. But the occasional opposition of many of its members to [[Joseph Stalin]] led to a [[Great Purge|purge]] of the body between the 17th and 18th Party Congresses (1934-39). Until Stalin's death, its role was therefore almost non-existent. 

After Stalin's death, there was a period of [[collective leadership]], which revitalised the Committee before it was returned to its compliant role. However the Committee did play a critical role in the career of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. In 1957, the Central Committee overturned a decision by the [[Presidium]] (the renamed Politburo) to remove Nikita Khrushchev as party leader. Khrushchev, with the assistance of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]], rallied the support of the Central Committee against what he called the [[Anti-Party Group]]. Seven years later, on October 14, 1964 it was a meeting of the Central Committee that deposed Khrushchev.

The Central Committee also made a landmark decision in March 1985 when it elected the reformist [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the next [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the CPSU]] with the margin of just one vote more than the hardliner [[Viktor Grishin]].

Following the failed coup of August 1991, the Central Committee was dissolved as was the Communist Party itself.

==Apparatus of the Central Committee==
The Secretariat headed the CPSU's central apparatus and was solely responsible for the development and implementation of party policies. The Secretariat also carried political weight because many of its members sat on the Politburo.

The members of the Secretariat supervised the work of the Central Committee departments. Department chiefs, who normally sat on the Central Committee, were subordinate to the secretaries.

A variety of departments made up the CPSU's central apparatus. Some departments were worthy of note. The Party Building and Cadre Work Department assigned party personnel in the [[nomenklatura]] system. The State and Legal Department supervised the armed forces, [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the trade unions, and the Procuracy.

Before 1989 the apparatus contained many more departments responsible for the economy. These departments included one for the economy as a whole, one for machine building, and one for the chemical industry, among others. The party abolished these departments in an effort to remove itself from the day-to-day management of the economy in favor of government bodies and a greater role for the market, as a part of the [[perestroika]] process.[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+su0195)]

The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая  партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup d'état attempt]] led by [[authoritarian]] hardliners.

It emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government in the Soviet Union and tolerated no opposition. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organization, [[Komsomol]]. The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].

The party ceased to exist after the coup d'état attempt in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.

==Names==
* [[Bolshevik]] [[Political faction|faction]] emerged within [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as ''[[de facto]]'' [[Voting bloc|political bloc]] separate from [[Menshevik]]s in 1903.
* The RSDLP was formally split in 1912, Henceforth, the Bolshevik faction was known as '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)''', '''RSDLP(b)''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , РСДРП(б)).
* In 1918 the Russian element took the name '''Russian Communist Party''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия}}). With Ukrainian independence coming about with the secession of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]the Ukrainian element became the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] ({{lang-uk|Комуністична Партія (більшовиків) України}} ''Komunistychna Partiya (bilshovykiv) Ukrayiny''). In 1920 the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] rejoined the RCP.
* In 1925 the party was renamed the '''All-Union Communist Party''' ({{lang-ru|Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия}}) , ВКП).
* In 1952 the party was renamed the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union'''.

==Structure==
===CPSU===
{{Soviet Union sidebar}}
{{Main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1–5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. {{Reference necessary|1=Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo|date=April 2010}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott, Stalin: Revolutionary In An Era of War (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 41-43..&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.

In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.

At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected &quot;partkom bureau secretary&quot; (&quot;partkom secretary&quot;, секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., &quot;partkoms&quot;. At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.

The bottom level of the Party was the &quot;primary party organization&quot; (первичная партийная организация) or &quot;party cell&quot; (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called &quot;party bureau&quot; (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected &quot;bureau secretary&quot; (секретарь партбюро).

At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an &quot;[[exempt secretary]]&quot; (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
*Tajikistan: less than 3%
*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935 (1974)

===Membership===
Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.

Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and &quot;social tasks&quot; (общественная работа).

In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the &quot;Lenin Levy&quot;) of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to &quot;proletarianize&quot; the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

===End of Communist rule===

In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.

The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the &quot;State Emergency Committee&quot; seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].

Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] .

* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of &quot;progressive&quot; communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

Other [[Christian denominations]] do not view monogamous same-sex relationships as sinful or immoral. These include the [[United Church of Canada]], and the [[United Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/national/05church.html NYTimes.com] &quot;United Church of Christ Backs Same-Sex Marriage&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Metropolitan Community Church]] was founded specifically to serve the Christian LGBT community.

Also in Europe many Christian churches do not view monogamous same sex relationships as sinful or immoral. These include all German Lutheran, reformed and united churches in [[Evangelical Church in Germany|EKD]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekd.de/EKD-Texte/lebensgemeinschaft_2000.html EKD:Verantwortung und Verlässlichkeit stärken (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;  all Swiss reformed churches in [[Swiss Reformed Church]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[Danish National Church]], the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Iceland]] and the [[Church of Norway]]. The [[Church of Finland]] also allows prayer for same-sex couples. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/kotimaa.shtml/2010/11/1223197/homojen-kanssa-rukoilemisesta-saatiin-paatos Church of Finland allows prayer for same sex couples (In Finnish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some denominations of the same Christian school of thought state opposing positions. Various parts of the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran Church]] hold stances on the issue ranging from declaring homosexual acts as sin to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCMS - Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_homosexuality.pdf| title = What about Homosexuality?|publisher = [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WELS - Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/christian-living/acceptance-homosexuals| title = Are homosexuals accepted in WELS?|publisher = [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Church of Sweden]] conducts [[same-sex marriage]]s, while the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] opens the ministry of the Church to gay and lesbian pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ELCA - Sodomy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4253| title = ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans|publisher = [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) is also much like Lutheranism in regards to homosexuality. For example, the [[Friends United Meeting]] and the [[Evangelical Friends International]] believe the sexual relations are condoned only in marriage, which they define to be between a man and a woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;FUM- Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf| title = History of FUM policy regarding the appointment of homosexuals|publisher = [[Friends United Meeting]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Friends General Conference]] and the Friends in Great Britain approve of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian &quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/31/quakers-gay-marriage| title = Quakers said same-sex couples 'miss the public recognition of their partnership in a religious ceremony'|publisher = The Guardian|accessdate = 2009-11-22 | location=London | first=Riazat | last=Butt | date=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New England Yearly Meeting of Friends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf| title = Homosexuality and Quakerism|publisher = [[New England Yearly Meeting]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[Anglican Communion]] does not approve of homosexual activity, with the exception of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], which is facing a possible exclusion from international Anglican bodies over the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Online - Anglican Communion &amp; Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article680066.ece| title = ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans|publisher = The Times|accessdate = 2009-11-22 | location=London | first=Ruth | last=Gledhill | date=2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Pentecostal denominations strongly oppose homosexual behavior,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} but there is a growing number of denominations and independent churches that are fully accepting and will perform same-sex marriages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} One such group, The [[Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals]] (GAAAP), traces its roots back to 1980, making it the oldest LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostal denomination in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affirmingapostolic.com GAAAP]&lt;/ref&gt; Another such organization is the [[Affirming Pentecostal Church]], currently the largest affirming Pentecostal organization, with churches in the US, UK, eastern Europe and west Africa.

In addition, some Christian denominations such as the [[Moravian Church]], believe that the [[Holy Bible]] speaks negatively of homosexual acts, although it is still working on establishing policy for the issue of ordination and homosexuality as research on the matter continues.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Moravian Interprovincial Faith &amp; Order Commission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html| title = On Homosexuality and Ordination|publisher = The Moravian Interprovincial Faith &amp; Order Commission|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian denominational positions on homosexuality ==
{{Main|List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality}}

The many [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] vary in their position on homosexuality, from seeing it as sinful, through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views.

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church] vatican.va. Retrieved 13 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrc.org/issues/religion/5037.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[ Christian Fundamentalism|Fundamentalist and Evangelical Protestant]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} churches do not sanction same-sex sexual relations. All jurisdictions, such as the [[Orthodox Church in America]], have taken the approach of welcoming people with &quot;homosexual feelings and emotions,&quot; while encouraging them to work towards &quot;overcoming its harmful effects in their lives,&quot; while not allowing the [[sacraments]] to people who seek to justify homosexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26 Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church views any sex activity not related to procreation and not undertaken by a married couple is sinful. These views do not only concern homosexuality but any sexual activity that can not result in [[Reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2357 Catechism of the Catholic Church, para. 2357 Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.com/library/Birth_Control.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The Seventh-day Adventist Church is opposed to same-gender sexual practices and relationships on the grounds that &quot;sexual intimacy belongs only within the marital relationship of a man and a woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main-stat46.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT-affirming denominations]] regard homosexuality as a natural occurrence. Many [[Mainline Protestant]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} churches are open and affirming to gay and lesbian couples. The [[United Church of Christ]] celebrates{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[gay marriage]], and some parts of the [[Anglican]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and [[Lutheran]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The [[United Church of Canada]] also allows same-sex marriage, and views [[sexual orientation]] as a gift from God. Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, [[Gene Robinson]] is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, bishop [[Eva Brunne]] is an openly lesbian Bishop in the [[Church of Sweden]]. Such religious groups and denominations interpretation of scripture and doctrine leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the [[United Church of Canada]], that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that &quot;a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full member of the Church''; and ''b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 Chronology of Marriage and Equality Rights in the United Church]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that &quot;human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Same-Sex Marriage Legislation Offers a Win-Win Solution, Says The United Church of Canada,&quot; 2005-FEB-01, United Church of Canada, at: http://www.united-church.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical views on homosexuality==

{{Main|History of Christianity and homosexuality}}

The late [[Yale University]] Church historian [[John Boswell]] argued for the existence of a rite of [[adelphopoiesis]] as a religiously sanctioned same-sex union.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Darling Young, &quot;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9411/articles/darling.html Gay Marriage: Reimagining Church History]&quot;, [[First Things]] 47 (November 1994), p. 43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halsall&quot;&gt;Paul Halsall, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/bosrevdisc-kennedy1.html Reviewing Boswell]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a [[Platonic love|Platonic]] brotherly bond, not a homosexual union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halsall&quot;/&gt; He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell2&quot;&gt;John Boswell, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/1979boswell.html The Church and the Homosexual- An Historical Perspective]'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=March 2011}} of Boswell have pointed out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality in ethical terms without prescribing a punishment, and that Boswell's citations reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties from the 12th century onwards.

==Contemporary views on homosexuality==
[[File:Franciscans for same-sex marriage.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Franciscan]] religious supporter of same-sex marriage]]

Many of the debates among Christians have roots in questions about the sources of authority different Christians believe represent God's purest or most definitive message. More generally: which kinds of arguments should be persuasive to Christians, and which do not possess the weight necessary to determine opinions and policies. Such is also the case with the issues related to the morality and inclusion of [[LGBT]] persons in Christian life.

In conservative strains of Protestant Christianity, Scripture is understood to be the only truly definitive authority (a position called [[Sola scriptura|Sola Scriptura]]). [[Exegesis]], or the reasoned study of the text to discover its own meaning, is the central concern for believers in Sola Scriptura. The classic formulation of Sola Scriptura regards [[good and necessary consequence|&quot;good and necessary consequence or deduction&quot;]] from Scripture as authoritative and morally binding; what these deductions might be is a frequent subject of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13635b.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Scripture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/chicago.stm.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbrem.com/bible/sufficn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Christians tend to regard the Bible as the record of human doings, composed of humans encountering the Divine within their specific historical context. They often interpret passages of the Bible as being less a record of actual events, but rather stories illustrating how to live ethically and authentically in relation to God. Some might, for instance, see Christ's death and resurrection in terms not of actual physical reanimation, but in terms of the good news of Jesus' teaching: that God's children are no longer slaves to the power of death.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Carter. ''Matthew and the Margins: a Sociopolitical and Religious Reading.'' Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professional [[exegetes]] {{Who|date=April 2010}} consider the Bible, to a greater or lesser degree, to be a document of its time, taking on attitudes which may not be God's. While they may hold the document as sacred, and most certainly as central to Christianity, they are also aware of the historical and cultural context in which it was originally written through archaeological and from critical study. Some scholars {{Who|date=April 2010}} feel that in addition to its spiritual components, portions of the text merely reflect the human authors' beliefs and feelings about God at the time of its writing, and their cultural sensibilities. The influence of such persons may reflect a heightened spiritual consciousness, or may simply represent people attempting to explain the world as best they could given the tools of the time. Such scholars purport that passages in scripture related to slavery, war, genocide, female marginalization, and sex between men may not necessarily be about God's wishes, but rather about the predominant culture's opinions at the time of the passage's writing.

===Views critical of homosexual behavior===

Christian objections to homosexual behavior are often based upon their interpretations of the [[Bible]]. Some [[Christians]] believe that the book of [[Leviticus]] contains prohibitions against male-male sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;leaderu.com&quot;&gt;http://www.leaderu.com/jhs/dallas.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citizenlink.org/FOSI/homosexuality/theology/A000008030.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2020:13;&amp;version=31;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2018:22;&amp;version=31;&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Biblical scholars interpret Genesis 19:5 as indicating that homosexual activity led to the destruction of the ancient cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leaderu.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Biblical passages that some interpret as addressing the issue of homosexual behavior include [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1, [[I Corinthians]] 6:8–10, and [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] 1:7;&lt;ref name=&quot;leaderu.com&quot;/&gt; the relevant portion of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1 reads as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men ... For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  (Romans 1:18a, 21–27)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%201&amp;version=31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian]] author and counselor [[Joe Dallas]] says that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual acts uniformly prohibit that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joedallas.com/resources/Relevance%20&amp;R.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Exodus International]] and others take the view that I Corinthians 6:9–11 offers [[Christian]] believers &quot;freedom from homosexuality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;http://home.messiah.edu/~chase/h/articles/art1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposing interpretations of the Bible that are supportive of homosexual relationships, conservative Christians have argued for the reliability of the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, by Bruce M. Metzger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wWDSR8y911kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inerrancy+of+the+bible Inerrancy By Norman L.

As an alternative to a school-sponsored [[Day of Silence]] opposing bullying of LGBT students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying &quot;As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the 20th century, theologians like [[Karl Barth]], [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Hans Küng]], [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]], [[David Edward Jenkins|Bishop David Jenkins]], [[Don Cupitt]] and [[John Shelby Spong|Bishop Jack Spong]] challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as &quot;homosexuality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See generally http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm and subpages therein.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay Witt, a minister in the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], explains how theologians and commentators like [[John Shelby Spong]], George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding [[Paganism|pagan]] faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: &quot;England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibition in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev.

Some Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBT orientation as currently understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |title=The Bible and Homosexuality |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work=SisterFriends Together |publisher=Grace Unfolding Ministries }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars.&lt;ref name = SLAVERY/&gt;&lt;ref name = WOMEN/&gt;&lt;ref name = ROGERS/&gt; There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles.&lt;ref name = SLAVERY/&gt;&lt;ref name = WOMEN/&gt;&lt;ref name = ROGERS/&gt; They consider some verses such as those they say support [[slavery]]&lt;ref name = SLAVERY&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm What the Bible says about slavery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the inferior treatment of women&lt;ref name = WOMEN&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ofe_bibl.htm ReligiousTolerance.org].&lt;/ref&gt; as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible. They cite these issues when arguing for a change in theological views on sexual relationships to what they say is an earlier view. They differentiate among various sexual practices, treating rape, [[prostitution]], or temple sex rituals as immoral and those within committed relationships as positive regardless of [[sexual orientation]]. They view certain verses, which they believe refer only to homosexual rape, as not relevant to consensual homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name = ROGERS&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ksWrErBqRVUC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=homosexual+rape+sodom+and+gomorrah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9cHm0_jzYf&amp;sig=hhQ7rpPMveL-dK0XJMS9NLjmPBg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=icdXSr6aPJuZjAf94cTNDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 Jesus, the Bible, and homosexuality; by Jack Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the lead of Yale scholar [[John Boswell]], it has been argued{{Who|date=October 2009}} that a number of early Christians entered into homosexual relationships,&lt;ref name=BOS&gt;{{Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | title= The Marriage of Likeness.

[[Desmond Tutu]], the former [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Price winner, has described homophobia as a &quot;crime against humanity&quot; and &quot;every bit as unjust&quot; as apartheid:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/13584 Desmond Tutu: &quot;Homophobia equals apartheid&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. ... We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities.

Others{{who|date=March 2011}} consider that Christ made the commandments to &quot;love God and one's neighbour,&quot; and to &quot;love one's neighbour as oneself&quot; touchstones of the moral law; that these imply a radical equality, and that, by this principle of equality, the Law of [[Moses]] is to be adjusted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Jesus]] exemplified this principle in his teaching on divorce. Furthermore, it is said that Jesus Christ instituted a virtue ethic, whereby the worth of one's action is to be adjudged by one's interior disposition.

Modern gay Christian leader [[Justin R. Cannon]] promotes what he calls &quot;Inclusive Orthodoxy&quot; (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: &quot;Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthsetsfree.net/about.htm INCLUSIVE ORTHODOXY: Gay Christian Ministry- Bible and Homosexuality?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's ministry takes a unique approach quite distinct from modern liberal Christians, yet which still supports homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says &quot;...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthsetsfree.net/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who accept that Christians can be homosexual, the sexual ethic aspired to corresponds to the model indicated in scripture and the tradition of the church for heterosexuals; this entails commitment and fidelity expressed through monogamy and life-long partnership or union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integrityusa.org/samesexblessings/slc97.htm Integrity USA on Report to general Convention on Same Sex Blessings]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TroyPerry2006-09-17.JPG|thumb|right|Rev. [[Troy Perry]] preaching in 2006 at a [[Metropolitan Community Church]].]]
[[George Barna]], a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed.  &quot;People who portray gay adults as [[Godlessness|godless]], [[hedonistic]], Christian bashers are not working with the facts,&quot; he said. &quot;A substantial majority of gays cite their [[faith]] as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] active in their life today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chellew-Hodge, Candace. &quot;[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God].&quot; ''ReligionDispatches''. 25 June [[2009 in literature|2009]]. . Retrieved June 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of 20 faith-oriented attributes revealed significant differences between the United States [[heterosexual]] and homosexual populations sampled, homosexual respondents being less likely to be ''born again Christians'' than heterosexual respondents (27% compared to 47%), and the degree of commitment to their faith and families also differed. Other significant contrasts were seen in regards to &quot;liberal&quot; versus &quot;conservative&quot; social positions, as well as in one’s understanding of God, with 43% of homosexual participants sharing the &quot;orthodox, biblical&quot; understanding of God which 71% of heterosexual participants indicate they do. Respondents were not asked to describe themselves as  &quot;[[born again Christian|born again]]&quot;, but as is standard in Barna studies, this classification was defined according to basic standard criteria.&lt;ref name = BARNAGAY/&gt; Barna concluded, “The data indicates that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians.&quot; And that &quot;Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God.&quot;&lt;ref name = BARNAGAY&gt;[http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights Spiritual Profile of Homosexual Adults Provides Surprising Insights]&lt;/ref&gt;

Candace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of online magazine ''Whoseoever'', responded to the findings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian [[religion|religious belief]]. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old &quot;gays vs. God&quot; [[dichotomy]] that too often gets played out in the [[Mass media|media]]. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians — they're just not as good as straight ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chellew-Hodge 2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God, Candace Chellew-Hodge, ReligionDispatches, 25 June 2009 (accessed June 27, 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his &quot;arrière pensée.&quot;  The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad [[internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chellew-Hodge 2009&quot;/&gt;

Organizations for [[homosexual]] Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational [[Gay Christian Network]] has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as &quot;[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side A]]&quot; and &quot;[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side B]]&quot;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychristian.net/index.php?

Some organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as [[Courage International]] and [[North Star (organization)|North Star]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://northstarlds.org North Star web site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate [[same-sex attraction]]s.  [[Exodus International]] and the associated [[Love Won Out]] are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as [[ex-gay]] organizations, though many no longer use the term.  [[Alan Chambers (Exodus International)|Alan Chambers]], the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/nation/na-exgay18 Approaching agreement in debate over homosexuality]&lt;/ref&gt; though the group [[Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays]] continues to use the term.

Gay Christian writer and actor [[Peterson Toscano]] argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a &quot;ruse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turning off gays |first=Mark |last=Benjamin |newspaper=Salon.com |date=18 July 2005 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/18/ungay/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organization he co-founded, [[Beyond Ex-Gay]], supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondexgay.com/ Beyond Ex-Gay Group for survivors of Ex-Gay ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Other groups]] support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, [[IntegrityUSA]] represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integrityusa.org/ Integrity (US Episcopal)]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] have the [[Reconciling Ministries Network]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians have ''Evangelicals Concerned''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecwr.org/index.php Evangelicals Concerned: Gay Christians]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, lesbian and gay evangelical Christians have a European forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroforumlgbtchristians.eu/home/home.asp European Forum of LGBT Christian Groups]&lt;/ref&gt;  Working within the worldwide Anglican Communion on a range of discrimination issues, including those of LGBT clergy and people in the church, is ''InclusiveChurch''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivechurch2.net/ InclusiveChurch (Anglican)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The longest standing group for lesbian and gay Christians in the UK, founded in 1976, is the non-denominational [[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcm.org.uk/ Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed to meet the needs of lesbian and gay evangelicals, there is the ''Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eflgc.org.uk/ Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt; specifically working within the Church of England is ''Changing Attitude'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingattitude.org.uk/home/home.asp Changing Attitude (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt; which also takes an international focus in working for gay, lesbian, bisexual &amp; transgender affirmation within the Anglican Communion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingattitude.org/home/home.asp Changing Attitude (International)]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Davis Mac-Iyalla|gay Anglicans in Nigeria]].

Sociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to GLBT members of liberal denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric.  His research shows that those GLBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches &quot;kill the messenger&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART Pitt, Richard N.

There is now a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcp2007&quot;&gt;Royal College of Psychiatrists: [http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Submission%20to%20the%20Church%20of%20England.pdf Submission to the Church of England’s Listening Exercise on Human Sexuality.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the major mental health professional organizations do not encourage individuals to try to change their sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Indeed, such interventions are ethically suspect because they can be harmful to the psychological well-being of those who attempt them; clinical observations and self-reports indicate that many individuals who unsuccessfully attempt to change their sexual orientation experience considerable psychological distress. For these reasons, no major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf Expert affidavit of Gregory M.

&lt;!-- NOTE. The following material is copied almost verbatim from the sources and is therefore a copyright violation: Sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by lesbian, gay and bisexual rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations, on the other. Some individuals and groups have promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that SOCE, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA Resolution&quot;&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts have serious potential to harm people because they present the view that the sexual orientation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth is a mental illness or disorder, and they often frame the inability to change one’s sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators, &amp; School Personnel]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA Resolution&quot;/&gt; --&gt;The co-founder and other former Exodus International members issued a public and formal apology for their work as ex-gay leaders and the harm they caused to those they tried to help.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDiYeJ_bsQo Former Ex-Gay Leaders Apologize]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ex-gay groups make no claim to change sexual orientation, but instead encourage [[celibacy]]. Organizations such as [[Exodus International]] and [[Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays]] believe that, regardless of one's sexual orientation, &quot;practicing homosexuality&quot; is always a deliberate choice. They present people who have attained &quot;abstinence from homosexual behaviors&quot; as reflecting the result of deliberate attempts at change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exodus.to/exodus_faqs_success.shtml#homosexual Exodus International – What's your &quot;success rate&quot; in changing gays into straights?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chadic languages''' constitute a language family spoken across northern [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]] and [[Cameroon]], belonging to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic phylum]]. The most widely spoken Chadic language is [[Hausa language|Hausa]], a [[lingua franca]] of much of inland West [[Africa]]. 

Newman 1977 divided the family into four groups, which have been accepted in all subsequent literature: 

*[[West Chadic languages]]
:Two branches, which include
::(A) the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Ron languages|Ron]], [[Bole languages|Bole]], and [[Angas languages|Angas]] languages; and

The '''Cushitic languages''' are a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family spoken in the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]. They are named after the ancient region of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] in the upper Nile basin.  The most populous Cushitic language is [[Oromo language|Oromo]] with about 35 million speakers, followed by [[Somali language|Somali]] with about 18 million speakers, and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]] in Ethiopia with about 2 million speakers. Other languages with more than one million speakers are [[Hadiyya language|Hadia]] (1.6 million), [[Kambaata language|Kambata]] (1.4 million), and [[Afar language|Afar]] (1.5 million).

==Composition==
There are eight clearly valid groups of languages which are or have been included in the Cushitic family, and there is a wide range of opinions as to how they are interrelated.

The [[Beja language]], or ''North Cushitic,'' is sometimes placed outside Cushitic proper, though there is no evidence that the rest of Cushitic forms a valid group. 

The positions of the small [[Dullay languages]] and [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]] are uncertain. These have traditionally been assigned to an ''East Cushitic'' branch along with [[Highland East Cushitic languages|Highland]] (Sidamic) and [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland]] East Cushitic. However, Richard Hayward believes East Cushitic may not be a valid node and breaks it into three well-supported families: Highlands, a diverse Lowlands family (with ''Afar, Somalic,'' and ''Oromic'' branches), and ''[[Dullay language|Dullay]]'' (he apparently leaves [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]] unclassified), which he believes should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic. 

[[Robert Hetzron|Hetzron]] (1980:70ff) and Ehret (1995) have suggested that the [[Rift languages]] ''(South Cushitic)'' are a part of Lowland East Cushitic.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Cushitic was traditionally seen as also including the [[Omotic languages]], then called ''West Cushitic.'' However, this view has largely been abandoned, primarily due to the work of [[Harold C. Fleming]] (1974) and [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|M. Lionel Bender]] (1975). These scholars consider Omotic to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic. While some scholars including Zaborski (1986) and Lamberti (1991) have kept the issue alive and suggested that Omotic can still be classified as part of Cushitic, Rolf Theil (2006), in keeping with the noted Chadicist Paul Newman, excludes Omotic from [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theil&quot;&gt;[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf Is Omotic Afro-Asiatic?] by Rolf Theil&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{USBankruptcy}}
'''Chapter 11''' is a chapter of the United States [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy Code]], which permits reorganization under the [[bankruptcy]] laws of the [[United States]]. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is available to every [[business]], whether organized as a [[corporation]] or [[sole proprietorship]], and to individuals, although it is most prominently used by corporate entities. In contrast, [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] governs the process of a [[liquidation]] bankruptcy, while [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] provides a reorganization process for the majority of private individuals.

==Chapter 11 in general==
When a business is unable to service its debt or pay its [[creditors]], the business or its creditors can file with a federal bankruptcy court for protection under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 11.

In Chapter 7 the business ceases operations, a trustee sells all of its assets, and then distributes the proceeds to its creditors. Any residual amount is returned to the owners of the company. In Chapter 11, in most instances the debtor remains in control of its business operations as a ''debtor in possession'', and is subject to the oversight and jurisdiction of the court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Practitioner&quot;&gt;Joseph Swanson and Peter Marshall, [[Houlihan Lokey]] and Lyndon Norley, Kirkland &amp; Ellis International LLP (2008). A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Restructuring. City &amp; Financial Publishing, 1st edition ISBN 9781905121311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of Chapter 11 reorganization==
Chapter 11 retains many of the features present in all, or most, bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. It provides additional tools for debtors as well. Most importantly, {{usc|11|1108}} empowers the trustee to operate the debtor's business. In Chapter 11, unless a separate trustee is appointed for cause, the debtor, as debtor in possession, acts as trustee of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|11|1107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 11 affords the debtor in possession a number of mechanisms to restructure its business. A debtor in possession can acquire financing and [[loan]]s on favorable terms by giving new lenders first priority on the business' earnings. The court may also permit the debtor in possession to reject and cancel contracts. Debtors are also protected from other litigation against the business through the imposition of an [[automatic stay]]. While the automatic stay is in place, most litigation against the debtor is stayed, or put on hold, until it can be resolved in bankruptcy court, or resumed in its original venue.

If the business's debts exceed its assets, the bankruptcy restructuring results in the company's owners being left with nothing; instead, the owners' rights and interests are ended and the company's creditors are left with ownership of the newly reorganized company.

All creditors are entitled to be heard by the court.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The court is ultimately responsible for determining whether the proposed plan of reorganization complies with the bankruptcy law.

One controversy that has broken out in bankruptcy courts since 2007 concerns the proper amount of disclosure that the court and other parties are entitled to receive from the members of the ad hoc creditor's committees that play a large role in many such proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/166ef296-0abb-11df-b35f-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html (Financial Times)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The chapter 11 plan===
Chapter 11 usually results in reorganization of the debtor's business or personal assets and debts, but can also be used as a mechanism for liquidation. Debtors may &quot;emerge&quot; from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy within a few months or within several years, depending on the size and complexity of the bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code accomplishes this objective through the use of a bankruptcy plan. With some exceptions, the plan may be proposed by any party in interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|11|1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested creditors then vote for a plan. 

====Confirmation====
If the judge approves the reorganization plan and if the creditors all agree the plan can be confirmed.  If at least one class of creditors votes against the plan and thus objects, the plan may nonetheless be confirmed if the requirements of [[cramdown]] are met.  In order to be confirmed over their objection the plan must not discriminate against that class of creditors and the plan is fair and equitable to that class.

Upon its confirmation, the plan becomes binding and identifies the treatment of debts and operations of the business for the duration of the plan.

Debtors in Chapter 11 have the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization for a period of time (in most cases 120 days). After that time has elapsed, creditors may also propose plans. Plans must satisfy a number of criteria in order to be &quot;confirmed&quot; by the bankruptcy court. Among other things, creditors must vote to approve the plan of reorganization. If a plan cannot be confirmed, the court may either convert the case to a liquidation under Chapter 7, or, if in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, the case may be dismissed resulting in a return to the status quo before bankruptcy. If the case is dismissed, creditors will look to non-bankruptcy law in order to satisfy their claims.

===Automatic stay===
As with other forms of bankruptcy, petitions filed under Chapter 11 invoke the [[automatic stay]] of § 362. The automatic stay requires all creditors to cease collection attempts, and makes many post-petition debt collection efforts void or voidable. Under some circumstances, creditors or the [[United States Trustee]] can ask the court to convert the case to a liquidation under Chapter 7, or to appoint a trustee to manage the debtor's business. The court will grant a motion to convert to Chapter 7 or appoint a trustee if either of these actions is in the best interest of all creditors. Sometimes a company will liquidate under Chapter 11, in which the pre-existing management may be able to help get a higher price for divisions or other assets than a Chapter 7 liquidation would be likely to achieve. Appointment of a trustee requires some wrongdoing or [[gross mismanagement]] on the part of existing management and is relatively rare.

===Executory contracts===
Some contracts, known as executory contracts, may be rejected if canceling them would be financially favorable to the company and its creditors. Such contracts may include labor union contracts, supply or operating contracts (with both vendors and customers), and real estate leases. The standard feature of executory contracts is that each party to the contract has duties remaining under the contract. In the event of a rejection, the remaining parties to the contract become unsecured creditors of the debtor. For example, in some districts a [[contract for deed]] is an executory contract, while in others it is not.

===Priority===
Chapter 11 follows the same priority scheme as other bankruptcy chapters. The priority structure is defined primarily by § 507 of the Bankruptcy Code ({{usc|11|507}}.)

As a general rule [[secured creditor]]s—creditors who have a [[security interest]], or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], in the debtor's property—will be paid before unsecured creditors. Unsecured creditors' claims are prioritized by § 507. For instance the claims of suppliers of products or employees of a company may be paid before other unsecured creditors are paid. Each priority level must be paid in full before the next lowest priority level may receive payment.

===Section 1110===
Section 1110 ({{usc|11|1110}}) generally provides a secured party with an interest in an aircraft the ability to take possession of the equipment within 60 days after a bankruptcy filing unless the airline cures all defaults. More specifically, the right of the lender to take possession of the secured equipment is not hampered by the automatic stay provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

==Stock==
If the company's stock is publicly traded, a Chapter 11 filing generally causes it to be [[delisting (stock)|delisted]] from its primary stock exchange if listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the [[American Stock Exchange]], or the [[NASDAQ]]. On the NASDAQ the identifying fifth letter &quot;Q&quot; at the end of a stock symbol indicates the company is in bankruptcy (formerly the &quot;Q&quot; was placed in front of the pre-existing stock symbol; a celebrated example was [[Penn Central]], whose symbol was originally &quot;PC&quot; and became &quot;QPC&quot; after the company filed Chapter 11 in 1970). Many stocks that are delisted quickly resume listing as [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) stocks. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the Chapter 11 plan, when confirmed, terminates the shares of the company, rendering shares valueless.

Individuals may file Chapter 11, but due to the complexity and expense of the proceeding, this option is rarely chosen by debtors who are eligible for Chapter 7 or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] relief.

==Rationale==
In enacting Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code, Congress concluded that it is sometimes the case that the value of a business is greater if sold or reorganized as a [[going concern]] than the value of the sum of its parts if the business's assets were to be sold off individually. It follows that it may be more economically efficient to allow a troubled company to continue running, cancel some of its debts, and give ownership of the newly reorganized company to the creditors whose debts were canceled. Alternatively, the business can be sold as a going concern with the net proceeds of the sale distributed to creditors ratably in accordance with statutory priorities. In this way, jobs may be saved, the (previously mismanaged) engine of profitability which is the business is maintained (presumably under better management) rather than being dismantled, and, as a proponent of a chapter 11 plan is required to demonstrate as a precursor to plan confirmation, the business's creditors end up with more money than they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation.

==Considerations==

The reorganization and court process may take an inordinate amount of time, limiting the chances of a successful outcome and sufficient debtor in possession financing may be unavailable during an economic recession. A preplanned, preagreed approach sometimes called a pre-packaged bankruptcy by the parties may facilitate the desired result. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the &quot;protection&quot; of the court until it emerges. An example is the [[airline industry]] in the United States; in 2006 over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | accessdate = November 17, 2005 | work=CNN | date=2005-09-14 | first1=Chris | last1=Isidore | first2=/Money | last2=Senior}}&lt;/ref&gt; These airlines were able to stop making debt payments, freeing up cash to expand routes or weather a price war against competitors &amp;mdash; all with the bankruptcy court's approval. This is especially important in the airline industry as fixed capital costs for the airplanes (and the debt on those costs) make up such a large part of the airlines' expenditures.

Studies on the impact of forestalling the creditors' rights to enforce their security reach different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1494270|title=The night of the killer zombies|work=Economist.com|date=2002-12-12|accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
===Frequency===
Chapter 11 cases dropped by 60% from 1991 to 2003. One 2007 study&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJSpurn&quot;&gt;(January 24, 2007), &quot;Small Firms Spurn Chapter 11&quot;, ''Wall Street Journal'', page B6B&lt;/ref&gt; found this was because businesses were turning to bankruptcy-like proceedings under state law, rather than the federal bankruptcy proceedings, including those under chapter 11. Insolvency proceedings under state law, the study stated, are currently faster, less expensive, and more private, with some states not even requiring court filings. However, a 2005 study&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJSpurn&quot;/&gt; claimed the drop may have been due to an increase in the incorrect classification of many bankruptcies as &quot;consumer cases&quot; rather than &quot;business cases&quot;.

Cases involving more than US$50 million in assets are almost always handled in federal bankruptcy court, and not in bankruptcy-like state proceeding.

===Largest cases ===
The [[Bankruptcy in the United States|largest bankruptcy]] in history was of the US investment bank [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]], which listed $639 billion in assets as of its Chapter 11 filing in 2008. The 16 largest corporate bankruptcies as of 1 November 2009:&lt;ref&gt;

'''Controversy''' is a state of prolonged public dispute or debate, usually concerning a matter of [[opinion]]. The word was coined from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''controversia'', as a composite of ''controversus'' – &quot;turned in an opposite direction,&quot; from ''contra'' – &quot;against&quot; – and ''vertere'' – to turn, or ''versus'' (see [[wikt:Verse|verse]]), hence, &quot;to turn against.&quot;

Perennial areas of controversy include [[history]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]] and [[politics]]. Other minor areas of controversy may include [[economics]], [[science]], [[finances]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. Controversy in matters of [[theology]] has traditionally been particularly heated, giving rise to the phrase ''[[odium theologicum]]''. Controversial issues are held as potentially divisive in a given society, because they can lead to tension and ill will, as a result they are often [[taboo]] to be discussed in the light of company in many cultures.  

{{Main|Controversy (law)}}
In the [[jurisprudence|theory of law]], a controversy differs from a [[legal case]]; while legal cases include all suits, [[Crime|criminal]] as well as [[Civil law (private law)|civil]], a controversy is a purely civil proceeding.

For example, the [[Case or Controversy Clause]] of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] ([[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Federal jurisdiction and trial by jury|Section 2]], Clause 1) states that &quot;the judicial Power shall extend&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party&quot;. This clause has been deemed to impose a requirement that United States federal courts are not permitted to hear cases that do not pose an actual controversy&amp;mdash;that is, an actual dispute between adverse parties which is capable of being resolved by the [[court]]. In addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, it also prohibits courts from issuing [[advisory opinion]]s, or from hearing cases that are either [[ripeness|unripe]], meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or [[mootness|moot]], meaning that the controversy has already been  resolved.

==Benford's law of controversy==

{{Main|Benford's law of controversy}}
[[Benford's law of controversy]], as expressed by [[science-fiction]] author [[Gregory Benford]] in 1980, states: ''[[Passion (emotion)|Passion]] is [[inversely proportional]] to the amount of real (true) [[information]] available.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eff.org/Misc/EFF/?f=quotes.eff.txt |title=EFF Quotes Collection 19.6 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=2001-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822143815/http://www.sysprog.net/quotlaws.html|archivedate=2008-08-22|url=http://www.sysprog.net/quotlaws.html|title=Quotations: Computer Laws |work=SysProg |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the fewer facts are known to and agreed on by the participants, the more controversy there is, and the more is known the less controversy there is. Thus, for example, controversies in physics are limited to areas where experiments cannot be carried out yet, whereas Benford's Law implies that controversy is inherent to politics, where communities must frequently decide on courses of action based on insufficient information.

{{Morefootnotes|article|date=May 2011}}
A '''centromere''' is a region of [[DNA]] typically found near the middle of a [[chromosome]] where two identical [[sister chromatids]] come closest in contact. It is involved in [[cell division]] as the point of [[mitotic spindle]] attachment. The sister chromatids are attached all along their length, but they are closest at the centromere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=sisterchromatidcohesion |title=Sister chromatid cohesion |date=May 15, 2011 |work=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centromere positions==&lt;!--Linked in [[Lund's Amphibious Rat]]--&gt;
Each chromosome has two arms, labeled p (the shorter of the two) and q (the longer). The p arm is named for &quot;petit&quot; meaning 'small'; the q arm is named q simply because it follows p in the alphabet. (According to the NCBI, &quot;q&quot; refers to the French word &quot;queue&quot; meaning 'tail'.) They can be connected in either metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric manner.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Metacentric===
A chromosome is '''metacentric''' if its two arms are roughly equal in length. In some cases, a metacentric chromosome is formed by balanced translocation: the fusion of two [[#Acrocentric|acrocentric]] chromosomes to form one metacentric chromosome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Submetacentric===
If arms' lengths are unequal, the chromosome is said to be '''submetacentric'''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Acrocentric===
If the p (short) arm is so short that is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is '''acrocentric''' (The &quot;acro-&quot; in acrocentric refers to the Greek word for &quot;peak&quot;.). The [[human genome]] includes five acrocentric chromosomes: [[Chromosome 13 (human)|13]], [[Chromosome 14 (human)|14]], [[Chromosome 15 (human)|15]], [[Chromosome 21 (human)|21]] and [[Chromosome 22 (human)|22]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In an acrocentric chromosome the p arm contains genetic material including repeated sequences such as nucleolar organizing regions, and can be translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced [[Robertsonian translocation]]. The [[horse|domestic horse]] genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to two acrocentric chromosomes in the [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] but undomesticated [[Przewalski's horse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=222–5 |doi=10.1159/000075753 |title=FISH analysis comparing genome organization in the domestic horse ''(Equus caballus)'' to that of the Mongolian wild horse ''(E. przewalskii)'' |year=2003 |last1=Myka |first1=J.L. |last2=Lear |first2=T.L. |last3=Houck |first3=M.L. |last4=Ryder |first4=O.A. |last5=Bailey |first5=E. |journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume=102 |pmid=14970707 |issue=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may reflect either fixation of a balanced Robertsonian translocation in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes; in this case, because more species are [[extant taxon|extant]], it is apparent that the evolutionary sequence is a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see [[Karyotype#Historical note]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Telocentric===
A '''telocentric''' chromosome's centromere is located at the terminal end of the chromosome. [[Telomeres]] may extend from both ends of the chromosome. For example, the standard house mouse karyotype has only acrocentric chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee M. |last=Silver |year=1995 |chapter=Karyotypes, Chromosomes, and Translocations |chapterurl=http://www.informatics.jax.org/silver/chapters/5-2.shtml |title=Mouse Genetics: Concepts and Applications |pages=83–92 |isbn=978-0-19-507554-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=520–62 |doi=10.1038/nature01262 |title=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome |year=2002 |last1=Chinwalla |first1=Asif T. |last2=Cook |first2=Lisa L. |last3=Delehaunty |first3=Kimberly D. |last4=Fewell |first4=Ginger A. |last5=Fulton |first5=Lucinda A. |last6=Fulton |first6=Robert S. |last7=Graves |first7=Tina A. |last8=Hillier |first8=Ladeana W. |last9=Mardis |first9=Elaine R. |journal=Nature |volume=420 |issue=6915 |pmid=12466850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not possess telocentric chromosomes. Some authors{{Who|date=May 2011}} denote extreme acrocentric chromosomes as telocentric- 21, 22, Y.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Subtelocentric===
If chromosome's centromere is located closer to its end than to its center, it may be described as '''subtelocentric'''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Holocentric===
With '''holocentric''' chromosomes, the entire length of the chromosome acts as the centromere. Examples of this type of centromere can be found scattered throughout the plant and animal kingdoms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=F33–8 |doi= 10.1083/jcb.153.6.F33 |title=Here, There, and Everywhere: Kinetochore Function on Holocentric Chromosomes |year=2001 |last1=Dernburg |first1=A. F. |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |volume=153 |issue=6 |pmid=11402076 |pmc=2192025}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the most well known example being in the nematode, ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.

==The centromeric sequence==
There are two types of centromeres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1591–4 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5242.1591 |title=The Centromere: Hub of Chromosomal Activities |year=1995 |last1=Pluta |first1=A. F. |last2=MacKay |first2=A. M. |last3=Ainsztein |first3=A. M. |last4=Goldberg |first4=I. G. |last5=Earnshaw |first5=W. C. |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5242 |pmid=7502067}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regional centromeres, [[DNA]] sequences contribute to but do not define function. Regional centromeres contain large amounts of DNA and are often packaged into [[heterochromatin]]. In most [[eukaryotes]], the centromere has no defined [[DNA sequence]]. It typically consists of large arrays of repetitive DNA (e.g. satellite DNA) where the sequence within individual repeat elements is similar but not identical. In humans, the primary centromeric repeat unit is called α-satellite (or alphoid), although a number of other sequence types are found in this region.

Point centromeres are smaller and more compact. DNA sequences are both necessary and sufficient to specify centromere identity and function in organisms with point centromeres. In budding yeasts, the centromere region is relatively small (about 125 bp DNA) and contains two highly conserved DNA sequences that serve as binding sites for essential kinetochore proteins.

==Inheritance==
Since centromeric DNA sequence is not the key determinant of centromeric identity in metazoans, it is thought that [[epigenetic inheritance]] plays a major role in specifying the centromere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=273–82 |doi=10.1139/O08-135 |title=Epigenetic specification of centromeres |year=2009 |last1=Dalal |first1=Yamini |journal=Biochemistry and Cell Biology |volume=87 |pmid=19234541 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daughter chromosomes will assemble centromeres in the same place as the parent chromosome, independent of sequence. It has been proposed that histone H3 variant CENP-A (Centromere Protein A) is the epigenetic mark of the centromere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=3233–41 |doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.07.023 |title=Epigenetic specification of centromeres by CENP-A |year=2009 |last1=Bernad |first1=Rafael |last2=Sánchez |first2=Patricia |last3=Losada |first3=Ana |journal=Experimental Cell Research |volume=315 |issue=19 |pmid=19660450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question arises whether there must be still some original way in which the centromere is specified, even if it is subsequently propagated epigenetically. If the centromere is inherited epigenetically from one generation to the next, the problem is pushed back to the origin of the first metazoans.

==Structure==
The centromeric DNA is normally in a [[heterochromatin]] state, which is essential for the recruitment of the [[cohesin]] complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion after DNA replication as well as coordinating sister chromatid separation during anaphase. In this chromatin, the normal [[histone]] H3 is replaced with a centromere-specific variant, CENP-A in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=85–93 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddi008 |title=Variable and hierarchical size distribution of L1-retroelement-enriched CENP-A clusters within a functional human neocentromere |year=2004 |last1=Chueh |first1=A. C. |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=14 |pmid=15537667 |last2=Wong |first2=LH |last3=Wong |first3=N |last4=Choo |first4=KH |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of CENP-A is believed to be important for the assembly of the kinetochore on the centromere. CENP-C has been shown to localise almost exclusively to these regions of CENP-A associated chromatin. In human cells, the histones are found to be most enriched for H4K20me3 and H3K9me3&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-143 |title=Determination of enriched histone modifications in non-genic portions of the human genome |year=2009 |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Jeffrey A |last2=Wang |first2=Zhibin |last3=Schones |first3=Dustin E |last4=Zhao |first4=Keji |last5=Desalle |first5=Rob |last6=Zhang |first6=Michael Q |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=10 |pages=143 |pmid=19335899 |pmc=2667539}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known heterochromatic modifications.

In the yeast ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' (and probably in other eukaryotes), the formation of centromeric heterochromatin is connected to [[RNAi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1833–7 |doi=10.1126/science.1074973 |title=Regulation of Heterochromatic Silencing and Histone H3 Lysine-9 Methylation by RNAi |year=2002 |last1=Volpe |first1=T.

==Centromeric aberrations==
In rare cases in humans, neocentromeres can form at new sites on the chromosome. There are currently over 90 known human neocentromeres identified on 20 different chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=261–82 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.009 |title=Neocentromeres: New Insights into Centromere Structure, Disease Development, and Karyotype Evolution |year=2008 |last1=Marshall |first1=Owen J. |last2=Chueh |first2=Anderly C. |last3=Wong |first3=Lee H. |last4=Choo |first4=K.H.

In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally euchromatic and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether.

Centromere proteins are also the autoantigenic target for some [[anti-nuclear antibodies]], such as [[anti-centromere antibodies]].

The '''Commodore 64''' is an [[8-bit]] [[home computer]] introduced by [[Commodore International]] in January 1982. Volume production started in the spring of 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of [[United States dollar|US $]]595.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE_Perry_C64&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mayhem64_co_uk-c64design&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=MayhemUK Commodore 64 archive |url=http://www.mayhem64.co.uk/c64design.htm}} 090918 mayhem64.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Preceded by the [[Commodore VIC-20]] and [[Commodore MAX Machine]], the C64 features {{nowrap|64 [[kilobyte]]s}} {{nowrap|(65,536 [[byte]]s)}} of memory with sound and graphics performance that were superior to [[IBM-compatible]] computers of that time. It is commonly known as the '''C64''' or '''C=64''' (after the graphic logo on the case) and occasionally as the '''CBM 64''' (for '''C'''ommodore '''B'''usiness '''M'''achines), or '''VIC-64'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/museum/view.php?id=274&amp;genre=manualcom VIC 64 Användarmanual].

During the C64's lifetime, sales totalled between 12.5 and 17 million units, making it the best-selling single [[personal computer]] model of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reimer1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jeremyreimer.com/total_share.html|title=Personal Computer Market Share: 1975-2004|last= Reimer|first=Jeremy|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PageTable&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=547|title=How many Commodore 64 computers were sold?|accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a substantial period of time (1983–1986), the C64 dominated the market with between 30% and 40% share and 2 million units sold per year,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reimer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars/4|title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures|last=Reimer|first=Jeremy|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; outselling the [[IBM PC clone]]s, [[Apple Inc.]] computers, and [[Atari 8-bit family]] computers.

Part of its success was because it was sold in retail stores instead of electronics stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control supplies and cost.

==History==
[[Image:C64 startup animiert.gif|260px|left|thumb|The Commodore 64 startup screen]]

In January 1981, [[MOS Technology]], Inc., Commodore's [[integrated circuit]] design subsidiary, initiated a project to design the graphic and audio chips for a next generation [[video game console]]. Design work for the chips, named [[MOS Technology VIC-II]] (graphics) and [[MOS Technology SID]] (audio), was completed in November 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE_Perry_C64&quot;&gt;Perry, Tekla S.; Wallich, Paul. &quot;Design case history: The Commodore 64&quot;. [[IEEE Spectrum]], March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A game console project was then initiated by Commodore that would use the new chips—called the ''Ultimax'' or alternatively the ''[[Commodore MAX Machine]]'', engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market.

At the same time, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Russell (system programmer and architect on the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]) and Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Yannes (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the [[Commodore PET]] line aimed at business users. With the support of Al Charpentier (engineer of the VIC-II) and Charles Winterble (manager of MOS Technology), they proposed to Commodore CEO [[Jack Tramiel]] a true low-cost sequel to the VIC-20. Tramiel dictated that the machine should have {{nowrap|64 kB}} of RAM. Although 64&amp;nbsp;KB of [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] cost over [[United States dollar|US$]] 100 at the time, he knew that DRAM prices were falling, and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached. In November, Tramiel set a deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE_Perry_C64&quot; /&gt;

The product was [[code name|codename]]d the VIC-40 as the successor to the popular [[VIC-20]]. The team that constructed it consisted of Bob Russell, Bob Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes and some sample software was finished in time for the show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] weekends.

The machine incorporated Commodore BASIC 2.0 in ROM and available immediately at startup.

When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64 in order to fit into the current Commodore business products lineup which contained the ''P128'' and the ''B256'', both named by a letter and their respective memory size.

The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]], as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: &quot;All we saw at our booth were [[Atari]] people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'&quot; The answer, as it turned out, was [[vertical integration]]; thanks to Commodore's ownership of [[MOS Technology]]'s [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor fabrication]] facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of only US$135.

===Winning the market war===
[[File:CBM64Cartridges.JPG|thumb|right|Games cartridges for [[Radar Rat Race]] and [[International Soccer]]]]

The C64 faced a wide range of competing [[home computer]]s at its introduction in August 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory1982&quot;/&gt; With an impressive price coupled with the C64's more flexible hardware, it quickly out-sold many of its competitors. In the [[United States]] the greatest competitors to the C64 were the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]] 400 and 800, and the [[Apple II series|Apple II]]. The Atari 400 and 800 were very similar in hardware terms, but used custom chips for graphics and sound, and so were very expensive to build. The Apple IIe, the latest in the aging Apple II line had higher resolution graphics modes than the C64,&lt;ref name=&quot;5150a&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=274|title=PC - Model 5150|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;5150b&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=83|title=APPLE IIe|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate= 2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to poor color support they were rarely used{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, so in practice the C64's 16-color (4-bit) graphics and sound abilities outmatched them at the time of its release. Upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, while the C64 had only a single external [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] port for bus expansion. However, the Apple used its expansion slots for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, leaving the cartridge port free.

All four machines had similar standard memory configurations in the years 1982/83: {{nowrap|48 kB}} for the Apple II+&lt;ref name=&quot;APPLEII+&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=571|title=APPLE II+|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (upgraded within months of C64's release to 64K with the Apple IIe) and 48K for the Atari 800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atari800&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=460|title= Atari 800|publisher=old-computers.com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At upwards of US$ 1200,&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple2history.org/history/ah06.html Apple II History Chap 6]&lt;/ref&gt; the Apple II was more than twice as expensive, while the Atari 800 cost US$899. One key to the C64's success was Commodore's aggressive marketing tactics, and they were quick to exploit the relative price/performance divisions between its competitors with a series of television commercials after the C64's launch in late 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commercials&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.commodorebillboard.de/Commercials/Commodore/english/CommodoreCommercialsEnglish.htm| title=Commodore Commercials|publisher=commodorebillboard.de|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodore sold the C64 not only through its network of authorized dealers, but also placed it on the shelves of department stores, discount stores, and toy stores. The C64 had a built-in [[RF modulator]] and thus could be plugged into a television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]]. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 could also output baseband [[composite video]] and thus could be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's baseband NTSC output capability included separate luminance/chrominance signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) [[S-Video]], for connection to the popular [[Commodore 64 peripherals#Other peripherals|Commodore 1702]] monitor.

Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered to be a major catalyst in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. In January 1983, Commodore offered a US$ 100 [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone trading in another computer or video game console. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a [[Timex Sinclair 1000]] for as little as US$ 10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; [[Timex Group USA|Timex Corporation]] departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a [[price war]] with the major [[home computer]] manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit of [[Texas Instruments]] and other smaller competitors from the field. The price war with Texas Instruments (TI) was seen as a personal battle for Commodore president [[Jack Tramiel]]; TI's subsequent demise in the home computer industry in October 1983 was seen as revenge for TI's tactics in the [[calculator|electronic calculator]] market in the mid 1970s, when Commodore was almost bankrupted by TI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeremy|last=Remier|url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/amiga-history-4-commodore-years.ars|title=A history of the Amiga, part 4: Enter Commodore|work= arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of the US in the late 1980s, new C64s could be purchased in retail chains for a little more than US$ 100.

In 1984, Commodore released the [[Commodore Plus/4]]. The Plus/4 offered a higher-color display, a better implementation of [[Commodore BASIC|BASIC]] (V3.5), and built-in software and was positioned as an inexpensive business oriented system. However, Commodore committed what was perceived by critics and consumers as a major strategic error by making it incompatible with the C64{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The Plus/4 lacked hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability and had much poorer sound, thus{{or|date=March 2011}} seriously under-performing in two of the areas that had made the C64 successful.

In [[Europe]], the primary competitors to the C64 were the British-built [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]]computer and the [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad CPC 464]]. In the UK, the Spectrum had been released a few months ahead of the C64, and was selling for less than half the price. The Spectrum quickly became the market leader and Commodore had an uphill struggle against the Spectrum as it could not rely on undercutting the competition. The C64 debuted at £399 in early 1983, while the Spectrum cost £175. The C64 would later rival the Spectrum in popularity in the latter half of the 1980s, eventually outliving the Spectrum, which was discontinued in December 1990.

Despite a few attempts by Commodore to discontinue the C64 in favor of other, higher priced machines, constant demand made its discontinuation a hard task. By 1988, Commodore was selling 1.5 million C64s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/CC517_commodore_64|date= 2007-07-24|title=Computer Chronicles: Interview with Commodore president with Max Toy|accessdate= 2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although demand for the C64 dropped off in the US by 1990, it continued to be popular in the UK and other European countries. In the end, economics, not obsolescence, sealed the C64's fate. In March 1994, at [[CeBIT]] in [[Hanover|Hanover, Germany]], Commodore announced that the C64 would be finally discontinued in 1995. Commodore stated that the C64's [[Commodore 1541|disk drive]] was more expensive to manufacture than the C64 itself. Although Commodore had planned to discontinue the C64 by 1995, the company filed for bankruptcy a month later, in April 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Amiga Format News Special. &quot;Commodore at CeBIT '94&quot;. Amiga Format, Issue 59, May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The C64 family===
[[Image:CommodoreMAX isolated.png|250px|[[Commodore MAX Machine]] (1982)|thumb]]
[[Image:Sx-64 build crop.jpg|150px|250px|[[Commodore SX-64]] (1984)|thumb]]

1982: Commodore released the [[Commodore MAX Machine]] in Japan. It is called the Ultimax in the US, and VC-10 in Germany. The MAX was intended to be a game console with limited computing capability, and was based on a very cut-down version of the hardware family later used in the C64. The MAX was discontinued months after its introduction, because of poor sales in Japan.

1983 saw Commodore attempt to compete with the [[Apple II]]'s hold on the U.S. education market with the [[Commodore Educator 64|Educator 64]],&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/ced64s.html|title=The Educator 64 &amp; Commodore PET 64 (aka C=4064)| publisher=zimmers.net|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially a C64 and monochrome monitor in a PET case. Schools preferred the all-in-one metal construction of the PET over the standard C64's separate components, which could be easily damaged, vandalized or stolen.

In 1984, Commodore released the [[Commodore SX-64|SX-64]], a portable version of the C64. The SX-64 has the distinction of being the first ''full-color'' [[portable computer]]. The base unit featured a {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and an integrated [[Commodore 1541|1541]] floppy disk drive. The SX-64 did not have a cassette connector.

Commodore, specifically two designers; Fred Bowen and [[Bil Herd]], were determined to avoid the problems of the [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]], making sure that the eventual successors to the C64—the [[Commodore 128]] and 128D computers (1985)—were as good as, and fully compatible with the original, as well as offering a host of improvements (such as a structured BASIC with graphics and sound commands, 80-column display capability, and full [[CP/M]] compatibility). The decision to make the [[Commodore 128]] compatible with the C64 was made quietly by Bowen and Herd , software and hardware designers respectively, without the knowledge or approval by the management in the post [[Jack Tramiel]] era. The designers were careful not to reveal their decision until the project was too far along to be challenged or changed and still make the impending Consumer Electronics Show (CES) show in Las Vegas. Upon learning that the C128 was designed to be compatible with the C64, Commodore’s marketing department independently announced that the C128 would be 100% compatible with the C64, thereby raising the bar for C64 support.

[[Image:C64c system.jpg|thumb|right|Commodore 64C with [[Commodore 1541|1541-II]] floppy disk drive and 1084S monitor displaying television-compatible [[S-video]]]]

In 1986, Commodore released the Commodore 64C (C64C) computer, which was functionally identical to the original, but whose exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the [[Commodore 128]] and other contemporary design trends. The modifications to the C64 line were more than skin deep in the C64C with new versions of the SID, VIC and I/O chips being deployed—with the core voltage reduced from 12 V to 9 V. In the [[United States]], the C64C was often bundled with the third-party [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based operating system. The [[Commodore 1541]] disk drive received a matching face-lift resulting in the 1541c. Later a smaller, sleeker 1541-II model was introduced along with the 800&amp;nbsp;KB 3.5-inch capable [[Commodore 1581|1581]].

In 1990, the C64 was re-released in the form of a game console, called the [[Commodore 64 Games System|C64 Games System]] (C64GS). A simple modification to the C64C's motherboard was made to orient the cartridge connector to a vertical position. This allowed cartridges to be inserted from above. A modified ROM replaced the BASIC interpreter with a boot screen to inform the user to insert a cartridge. It was designed to rival the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System but it suffered from very low sales compared to its rivals and it was another commercial failure for Commodore, and it was never released outside of Europe.

In 1990, an advanced successor to the C64, the [[Commodore 65]] (also known as the &quot;C64DX&quot;), was prototyped, but the project was canceled by Commodore's chairman [[Irving Gould]] in 1991. The C65's specifications were very good for an 8-bit computer. For example, it could display 256 colors on screen, while [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] based Amigas could only display 64 in [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|HalfBrite]] mode (32 colors and half-bright transformations); the [[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] mode on the Amiga allowed all 4096 colors of the 12 bit color system, but it was awkward to use and had restrictions on color combinations between adjacent pixels. Although no specific reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it would have competed in the marketplace with Commodore's lower end Amigas and the [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]].

===C64 clones===
In the middle of 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer [[Nedfield|Tulip Computers BV]] (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] (C64DTV), a [[joystick]]-based [[Handheld TV game|TV game]] based on the C64 with 30 games built into ROM. Designed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]], a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern [[C-One]] C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]] which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on [[QVC]] in the United States for the 2004 holiday season. Some users have installed [[Commodore 1541|1541]] floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks and keyboards to these units, which give the DTV devices nearly all of the capabilities of a full Commodore 64. The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console/game ''Hummer'', sold at [[RadioShack]] mid-2005.

C64 enthusiasts still develop new hardware, including [[Ethernet]] cards,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunkels&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunkels.com/adam/tfe/|title=The Final Ethernet - C64 Ethernet Cartridge|last= Dunkels|first=Adam|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; specially adapted [[hard disk]]s and [[Flash memory|Flash]] Card interfaces ([[sd2iec]]&lt;ref name=&quot;sd2iec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/SD2IEC|title=SD2IEC on c64 wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Relaunch===
[[Commodore USA]], LLC, a company licensing the Commodore trademark, planned to release a PC branded C64 in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iconic Commodore 64 All Set For Comeback|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2011/04/06/iconic-commodore-64-all-set-comeback/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recreating the Legendary Commodore 64|url=http://www.commodoreusa.net/CUSA_C64.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This &quot;C64x&quot; has a case resembling the original C64 computer, but is based on [[X86]] architecture. The machine is a net-top spec computer which comes with a 1.8Ghz 64-bit dual core D525 Atom processor, [[Nvidia]] ION2 onboard graphics, WiFi, Hard Disk and an optional built-in DVD or Bluray player. 
It is planned to ship initially with Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition. In addition to this, Commodore USA claims they are also developing their own Linux derivative called Commodore OS, that along with a classic games package, they plan to ship out to early adopters. There will be no hardware compatibility with the original C64, with software compatibility provided through the use of an emulator.

==Software==
{{Main|Commodore 64 software}}

At the time of its introduction, the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were rivaled only by the [[Atari 8-bit family]]. This was at a time when most IBM PCs and compatibles had text-only display adapter cards, [[monochrome monitor]]s, and sound consisting of squeaks and beeps from the built-in tiny, low-quality [[PC speaker|speaker]].

The C64 is often credited with starting the computer subculture known as the [[demoscene]] (see [[Commodore 64 demos]]). The C64 lost its top position among demo coders when the [[16-bit]] [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] were released in 1985, however it still remained a very popular platform for demo coding up to the early 90s{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

It is still being actively used as a demo machine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/c4-2008/c4-2008.html&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Commodore 64 demos]]), especially for music (its [[MOS Technology SID|sound chip]] even being used in special sound cards for PCs, and the [[Elektron SidStation]] synthesizer). Unfortunately, the differences between [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] C64s caused compatibility problems between U.S./Canadian C64s and those from most other countries. The vast majority of demos run only on PAL machines.

Even though it was released in 1982, the C64 was still a strong competitor to the later [[video game console|consoles]] [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Master System]], thanks to its by-then established software base.

During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 was used to run numerous [[Bulletin Board System]]s using software packages such as [[Bizarre 64]], [[Blue Board]] and [[Color 64]], often with [[sysop]]-made modifications. These boards often were used to distribute [[cracked software]].

===BASIC===
{{Main|Commodore BASIC}}
[[Image:Simons Basic Splash Screen.gif|thumb|right|The Simons' BASIC start-up screen. Note the altered background and text colours (vs the ordinary C64 blue tones), and the 8 [[kilobyte|KB]] reduction of available BASIC program memory due to the [[address space]] used by the cartridge.]]

As was common for machines of the time, the C64 incorporated a ROM based version of the BASIC programming language. Commodore BASIC 2.0 was used instead of the more advanced BASIC 4.0 from the PET series, since its users were not expected to need the disk-oriented enhancements of BASIC 4.0. &quot;The choice of BASIC 2.0 instead of 4.0 was made with some soul-searching, not just at random. The typical user of a C64 is not expected to need the direct disk commands as much as other extensions, and the amount of memory to be committed to BASIC was to be limited. We chose to leave expansion space for color and sound extensions instead of the disk features. As a result, you will have to handle the disk in the more cumbersome manner of the 'old days'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;C64 basic introduction, Pg. 65, Commodore Magazine, Aug 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of BASIC was limited and did not include commands for sound or graphics manipulation, instead users had to use the &quot;[[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]&quot; command to access the graphics and sound chip registers directly. In order to provide extended commands including graphics and sound Commodore produced two different cartridge-based extension to BASIC 2.0 — [[Simons' BASIC]] and [[Super Expander 64]].

===Alternative operating systems===
A number of third party operating systems have been developed for the C64.
[[Image:GeOS Commodore 64.gif|thumb|GEOS for the Commodore 64]]

As well as the original [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]], two third-party GEOS-compatible operating systems have been written: [[Wheels (operating system)|Wheels]] and [[GEOS megapatch]]. Both of these require hardware upgrades to the original C64.

Several other operating systems are or have been available, including [[WiNGS OS]], the Unix-like [[LUnix]], operated from a command-line, and the embedded systems OS [[Contiki]], with full GUI. Other less well known OSes include ACE, Asterix, DOS/65 and [[GeckOS]].

A version of CP/M was released, but this required the addition of an external Z80 processor to the expansion bus, so is not considered a true C64 OS. Furthermore, the Z80 processor was underclocked to be compatible with the C64's memory bus, so performance was poor compared to other CP/M implementations. C64 CP/M and C128 CP/M both suffered a lack of software: although most commercial CP/M software would technically run on these systems, software media was incompatible between platforms. The low usage of CP/M on Commodores meant that software houses saw no need to invest in mastering versions for the Commodore filesystem. The [[Commodore 1571]] disk drive was made compatible with a wide variety of disk formats to eliminate this weakness.

===Networking software===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Qlink-mainmenu.png|thumb|Quantum Link main menu {{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 17 May 2011}}]] --&gt;

[[Quantum Link]] (or Q-Link) was a U.S. and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985 to November 1, 1994. It was operated by [[Quantum Computer Services]] of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 changed its name to [[America Online]], and continues to operate its [[AOL]] service for the [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] today. Q-Link was a modified version of the [[PlayNET]] system, which [[Control Video Corporation]] (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.

The Quantum Link networking service became America Online which became AOL-Time Warner which was then contracted to AOL.

===Online gaming===
{{Main|History of massively multiplayer online games}}

[[Don Daglow]] and the [[Stormfront Studios|Stormfront]] game design team began working with [[AOL]] on original online games in 1987, in both text-based and graphical formats. At the time AOL was a Commodore 64 only online service, known as [[Quantum Computer Services]], with just a few thousand subscribers, and was called [[Quantum Link]]. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the need to support modem data transfer rates as slow as 300 [[bits per second]] (bit/s). During the early 1990s, commercial use of the internet was limited by [[NSFNET]] acceptable use policies. Consequently, early online games like [[Legends of Future Past]], [[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]], [[GemStone III]], [[Dragon's Gate]], and [[Federation]] relied heavily on proprietary services such as [[CompuServe]], [[America Online]], and [[GEnie]] for distribution.

The first graphical character-based interactive environment was ''[[Club Caribe]]''. First released as ''[[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]]'' in 1988, ''Club Caribe'' was introduced by [[LucasArts]] for [[Q-Link]] customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although very basic, its use of online avatars (already well established off-line by [[Ultima (series)|Ultima]] and other games) and combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary.

==Hardware==
{{Repetition|date=April 2010}}

===CPU and memory===
{{Main|MOS Technology 6510}}

The C64 uses an [[8-bit]] [[MOS Technology 6510]] [[microprocessor]]. This is a close derivative of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] with an added 6-bit internal I/O port that in the C64 is used for two purposes: to bank-switch the machine's [[Read Only Memory|ROM]] in and out of the processor's address space, and to operate the [[Commodore Datasette|datasette]] tape recorder.

The C64 has 64&amp;nbsp;KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], of which {{nowrap|38 kB}} are available to built-in [[Commodore BASIC|Commodore BASIC 2.0]].

===Graphics===
{{Main|MOS Technology VIC-II}}

The [[Video Display Controller|graphics chip]], [[MOS Technology VIC-II|VIC-II]], features 16 colors, eight hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] per scanline (enabling up to 112 sprites per PAL screen), [[scrolling]] capabilities, and two bitmap graphics modes. The standard text mode features 40 columns, like most [[Commodore PET]] models; the built in character encoding is not standard [[ASCII]] but [[PETSCII]], an extended form of ASCII-1963.

Most screen shots show borders around the screen, which is a feature of the VIC-II chip. By utilising interrupts to reset various hardware registers on precise timings it was possible to place graphics within the borders and thus utilise the full screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ojala&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antimon.org/dl/c64/code/opening.txt|title=Opening the Borders|last=Ojala|first=Pasi| accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
{{Main|MOS Technology SID}}

The [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] chip has three channels, each with its own [[ADSR envelope]] generator, [[ring modulation]] and filter capabilities. [[Bob Yannes]] developed the SID chip and later co-founded synthesizer company [[Ensoniq]]. Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as &quot;primitive, obviously... designed by people who knew nothing about music&quot;. Often the game music became a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 are [[Rob Hubbard]], [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]], [[Chris Hülsbeck]], [[Ben Daglish]], [[Martin Galway]], [[David Dunn (composer/programmer)|David Dunn]] and [[Kjell Nordbø (composer/programmer)|Kjell Nordbø]] among many others. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are played as [[arpeggio]]s, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. As of 2008, it became possible to play four channel 8-bit audio samples, 2 SID channels and still use filtering. 

There are two versions of the SID chip, the 6581 and the 8580. The MOS Technology 6581 was used in the original &quot;breadbox&quot; C64s, the early versions of the C64C and the [[Commodore 128]]. The 6581 was replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. The 6581 sound quality is a little more crisp, and many Commodore 64 fans prefer its sound. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 is the supply voltage. The 6581 uses a 12 volt supply - the 8580, a nine volt supply. A modification can be made to use the 6581 in a C64C board (which uses the nine volt chip).

The SID chip has a distinctive sound which has retained a following of devotees to such a degree, that a number of audio enthusiasts and companies have designed [[MOS Technology SID#Hardware reimplementations|SID-based products]] as add-ons for the C64, [[x86|x86 PCs]], and standalone or [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] music devices such as the [[Elektron SidStation]]. These devices use chips taken from excess stock, or removed from used computers.

In 2007, [[Timbaland]]'s extensive use of the [[SidStation]] led to the [[2007 Timbaland plagiarism controversy]] around his tracks ''Block Party'' and ''[[Do It]]'' (written for [[Nelly Furtado]]).

===Hardware revisions===
Cost reduction was the driving force behind the C64's motherboard revisions. Reducing manufacturing costs was vitally important to Commodore's survival during the price war and leaner years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original ([[NMOS logic|NMOS]] based) motherboard would go through two major redesigns, (and numerous sub-revisions) exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and [[programmable logic array|PLA]] chips. Initially, a large portion of the cost was eliminated by reducing the number of discrete components, such as diodes and resistors, which enabled the use of a smaller [[printed circuit board]].

[[Image:C64motherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An early C64 motherboard (Rev A [[PAL]] 1982).]]
[[Image:C64Cmotherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A C64C motherboard (&quot;C64E&quot; Rev B PAL 1992).]]

====ICs====
The VIC-II was manufactured with 5 [[micrometre|micrometer]] NMOS technology&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE_Perry_C64&quot; /&gt; and was clocked at either {{nowrap|17.73447 MHz}} (PAL) or {{nowrap|14.31818 MHz}} (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided down to generate the dot clock (about 8&amp;nbsp;MHz) and the [[two-phase clock|two-phase system clocks]] (about 1&amp;nbsp;MHz; the exact pixel and system clock speeds are slightly different between NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates, the chip generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic [[Dual in-line package|DIL package]] (called a &quot;CERDIP&quot;). The ceramic package was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.

After a redesign in 1983, the VIC-II was encased in a plastic Dual Inline Package, which reduced costs substantially, but it did not totally eliminate the heat problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE_Perry_C64&quot; /&gt; Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a [[heat sink]]. To avoid extra cost, the metal [[radio frequency|RF]] [[electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in [[Europe]] shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips.

The SID was manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE_Perry_C64&quot; /&gt; The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic Dual Inline Package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.

====Motherboard====
In 1986, Commodore released the last revision to the classic C64 motherboard. It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except for the two 64 [[kilobit]] × 4 bit [[DRAM]] chips that replaced the original eight 64 kilobit × 1 bit ICs.

After the release of the C64C, MOS Technology began to reconfigure the C64's chipset to use [[HMOS]] production technology. The main benefit of using HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, which consequently generates less heat. This enhanced the overall reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was re-numbered to 85xx in order to reflect the change to HMOS.

In 1987 Commodore released C64Cs with a totally redesigned motherboard commonly known as a &quot;short board&quot;. The new board used the new HMOS chipset, featuring a new 64-pin PLA chip. The new &quot;SuperPLA&quot;, as it was dubbed, integrated many discrete components and [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] chips. In the last revision of the C64C motherboard, the 2114 color RAM was integrated into the SuperPLA.

===Power supply===
The C64 used an external [[power supply]]. This saved space within the computer's case. The 1541-II and 1581 disk drives, along with various third-party clones, also came with their own external power supply &quot;bricks&quot;. These power supplies were notorious for failing over time. Many lasted less than two years and had to be replaced. Commodore later changed the design, however the new version was also prone to failure. It has been speculated that these supplies failed due to voltage regulator overheating. They were entirely encapsulated within an epoxy resin, a poor conductor of heat and impossible to repair. As of 2010, many Commodore 64 owners use home-made power supplies, often using separate 5 volt DC and 9 volt AC power supplies, wired to a common plug that attaches to the Commodore 64.

**Expandable to 320&amp;nbsp;kB with [[Commodore REU|Commodore 1764]] 256&amp;nbsp;kB [[Commodore REU|RAM Expansion Unit]] (REU); although only 64&amp;nbsp;kB directly accessible; REU mostly intended for [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]]. REUs of 128&amp;nbsp;kB and 512&amp;nbsp;kB, originally designed for the C128, were also available, but required the user to buy a stronger power supply from some third party supplier; with the 1764 this was included. [[Creative Micro Designs]] also produced a 2&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] REU for the C64 and C128, called the 1750 XL. The technology actually supported up to 16&amp;nbsp;MB, but 2&amp;nbsp;MB was the biggest one officially made. Expansions of up to 16&amp;nbsp;MB were also possible via the CMD SuperCPU.

**8-pin [[DIN connector]] containing [[composite video]] output, separate [[S-Video|Y/C]] outputs and sound input/output. Beware that this is the 270° (horseshoe) version of the plug, not the 360° circular version. Also note that some early C64 units use a 5-pin DIN connector that carries composite video and luminance signals, but lacks a chroma signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlsen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://project64.c64.org/hw/avconnect.txt|title=C64 video port|last=Carlsen|first=Ray|accessdate= 2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**User port (edge connector with [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]-level signals, for modems and so on.; byte-parallel signals which can be used to drive third-party parallel printers, among other things, 17 logic signals, 7 Ground and voltage pins, including 9V AC)
**2 × screwless [[D-subminiature|DE9M]] [[game controller]] ports (compatible with Atari 2600 controllers), each supporting five digital inputs and two analog inputs. Available peripherals included digital [[joystick]]s, analog [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]]s, a [[light pen]], the Commodore 1351 [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], and the unique [[KoalaPad/Painter|KoalaPad]].

*Power supply:
**5[[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]] and 9V[[Alternating current|AC]] from an external &quot;power brick&quot;, attached to a 7-pin female DIN-connector on the computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;allpinouts_org-Commodore_C64_Power_Supply&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Commodore C64 Power Supply Connector Pinout - AllPinouts|url=http://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Commodore_C64_Power_Supply}} 090505 allpinouts.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nowrap|9 volt AC}} is used to supply power via a [[charge pump]] to the [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] sound generator chip, provide {{nowrap|6.8V}} via a rectifier to the cassette motor, a &quot;0&quot; pulse for every positive half wave to the time-of-day (TOD) input on the CIA chips, and {{nowrap|9 volts AC}} directly to the user-port. Thus, as a minimum, a {{nowrap|12 V}} [[square wave]] is required. But a {{nowrap|9 V}} [[sine wave]] is preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmers_net-250469-rev_A-left&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Commodore-64 BN/E 250469 schematic|url=http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/c64/250469-rev.A-left.gif}} 090519 zimmers.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmers_net-250469-rev_A-right&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Commodore-64 BN/E 250469 schematic|url=http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/c64/250469-rev.A-right.gif}} 090519 zimmers.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cartography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chartis'' = map and ''graphein'' = write) is the study and practice of making [[map]]s. Combining science, [[aesthetics]], and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.

The fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
*Set the map's agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped. This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as [[Toponomy|toponyms]] or political boundaries.
*Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of [[map projection]]s.
*Eliminate  characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant to the map's purpose. This is the concern of [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]].
*Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the concern of generalization.
*Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience. This is the concern of [[#Map design|map design]].

Modern cartography is closely integrated with geographic information science (GIScience) and constitutes many theoretical and practical foundations of [[geographic information system]]s.

The earliest known map is a matter of some debate, both because the definition of &quot;map&quot; is not sharp and because some artifacts speculated to be maps might actually be something else. A wall painting, which may depict the ancient Anatolian city of [[Çatalhöyük]] (previously known as Catal Huyuk or Çatal Hüyük), has been dated to the late [[7th millennium BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_5_20/ai_54432963 Findarticles.com] &quot;A Tale of two obsessed archeologists, one ancient city, and nagging doubts about whether science can ever hope to reveal the past&quot; by Robert Kunzig.

The [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]] created maps, beginning at latest with [[Anaximander]] in the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Cartography|url=http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781534525/cartography_history_of.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQeQNdg|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century AD, [[Ptolemy]] produced his [[treatise]] on cartography, [[Geographia]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

As early as the 8th century, Arab scholars were translating the works of the [[List of Graeco-Roman geographers|Greek geographers]] into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geography|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552030_3/geography.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQdtmEV|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient China]], geographical literature spans back to the 5th century BC. The oldest extant Chinese maps come from the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], dated back to the 4th century BC, during the [[Warring States Period]]. In the book of the ''Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao'', published in 1092 by the [[China|Chinese]] scientist [[Su Song]], a [[star map]] on the equidistant cylindrical projection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miyajima&quot;&gt;Miyajima, Kazuhiko (1997).

Norwell: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 569.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this method of charting seems to have existed in China even prior to this publication and scientist, the greatest significance of the star maps by Su Song is that they represent the oldest existent star maps in [[printing|printed]] form.

Early forms of [[cartography of India]] included the locations of the [[Pole star]] and other constellations of use.&lt;ref name=Sircar3/&gt; These charts may have been in use by the beginning of the [[Common Era]] for purposes of navigation.&lt;ref name=Sircar3&gt;Sircar 330&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mappa mundi]] is the general term used to describe Medieval European maps of the world. Approximately 1,100 mappae mundi are known to have survived from the [[Middle Ages]]. Of these, some 900 are found illustrating manuscripts and the remainder exist as stand-alone documents.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, p.&amp;nbsp;286&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] produced his medieval atlas ''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]'' in 1154. He incorporated the knowledge of [[Africa]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Far East]], gathered by [[Islamic economics in the world|Arab merchants]] and explorers with the information inherited from the classical geographers to create the most accurate map of the world up until his time. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;S. P. Scott (1904), ''History of the Moorish Empire'', pp. 461-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Exploration]], from the 15th century to the 17th century, [[Europe]]an cartographers both copied earlier maps (some of which had been passed down for centuries) and drew their own based on explorers' observations and new [[surveying]] techniques. The invention of the [[magnetic compass]], [[telescope]] and [[sextant]] enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models -- Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Werner]] refined and promoted the ''Werner [[map projection]]''. In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name &quot;America&quot;. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cartographer [[Diego Ribero]] was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer [[Battista Agnese]] produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts.

Due to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography, map-makers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, one of the most famous early maps of North America is unofficially known as the &quot;Beaver Map&quot;, published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is an exact reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer in turn had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[François Du Creux]], in 1664. By the 18th century, map-makers started to give credit to the original engraver by printing the phrase &quot;After [the original cartographer]&quot; on the work.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Map Imitation&quot; in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/forgery/002035-300-e.html?PHPSESSID=el7bd0vpd8cto0amsqqq5kaj22 Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Real-time map construction improve productivity and quality of mapping. Image is showing mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]

In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were manually constructed with brushes and parchment; therefore, varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to store and manipulate them digitally.

Advances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed for the mass production of maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions from more accurate data. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed for accurate surveying of land and the ability of mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the [[sun]] at noon.

Advances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], have allowed for the creation of maps that have fine details, do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further shortened the time it takes to make and reproduce maps.

Advances in electronic technology in the 20th century ushered in another revolution in cartography. Ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also: [[digital raster graphic]].

These days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] that falls into one of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive [[map]]s that can be manipulated digitally.

With the [[rugged computer|field rugged computers]], [[GPS]] and [[laser rangefinder]]s, it is possible to perform mapping directly in the terrain. The construction of the map in real time improve productivity and quality of the result. '''Real time mapping''' is done for example with [[Field-map]] technology.

==Map types==
===General vs thematic cartography===
[[Image:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]
[[Image:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]
[[Image:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|180px|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]

In understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&amp;nbsp;inch to 1 mile) &quot;[[Ordnance Survey]]&quot; maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail.

[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic_map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.

An [[orienteering]] map combines both general and thematic cartography, designed for a very specific user community. The most prominent thematic element is shading, that indicates degrees of difficulty of travel due to vegetation. The vegetation itself is not identified, merely classified by the difficulty (&quot;fight&quot;) that it presents.

===Topographic vs topological===
A [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th century) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]).

A [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind you might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Though the most widely used map of &quot;The Tube,&quot; it preserves little of reality: It varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions haphazardly. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.&lt;ref&gt;Ovenden, Mark. &quot;Transit Maps of the World&quot;. New York, New York: [[Penguin Books]], 2007. Page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Keith. ''The Millennium Problems''. New York, New York: Basic Books, 2002. Pages 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Map purpose and informations' selection ===
[[Arthur H. Robinson]], an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed &quot;will be a cartographic failure.&quot; He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that &quot;map design is perhaps the most complex.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Elements of Cartography |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1953 |id=ISBN |isbn=0471728055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs.

From the very beginning of mapmaking, maps &quot;have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Early Thematic Mapping: In the History of Cartography. |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press. |year=1982 |id=ISBN |isbn=0226722856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term ''percipient'' refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] |title=How Maps Work |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1995 |id=ISBN |isbn=157230040X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[Figure-ground in map design|figure-ground]] refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the user’s experience and keep his attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.

Making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal. [[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map &quot;is convincing because it implies authenticity&quot; (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;9). An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the &quot;needed link&quot; necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it (Monmonier, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;93).

In the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map - for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].

===Naming conventions===
Most maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as a map title, legend and other information. Maps are often made in specific languages, though names of places often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A word that describes a place, using a non-native terminology or language is referred to as an [[exonym]].

In some cases the proper name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Difficulties arise, when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. National names tend to have well established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' for Росси́я, but for many placenames a system of transliteration or transcription is required. In transliteration, the symbols of one language are represented by symbols in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] letter ''Р'' is traditionally written as ''R'' in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukhā, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is transformed into the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.

Further difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Québec'' in French.&lt;ref&gt;This section based on: {{cite encyclopedia|title=Transliteration Systems|encyclopedia=Illustrated Atlas of the World|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|journal=Quantum Electronics|year=1992|doi=10.1070/QE1995v025n01ABEH013084|bibcode=1995QuEle..25...87.|volume=25|pages=A16–A17|isbn=0-528-83492-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].

In order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is Lance Wyman's early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Ovenden|Ovenden, Mark]]. &quot;Transit Maps of the World&quot;. New York, New York: Penguin Books, 2007. Pages 60, 131, 132, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map symbology===
[[File:Southwest Ireland Thornton.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of the southwest coast of [[Ireland]] created in the early 18th century. Notice the north arrow at the bottom of the map. Also, colors are used in the map to distinguish different geographical areas.]]
The quality of a map’s design affects its reader’s ability to extract information and to learn from the map. Cartographic [[symbology]] has been developed in an effort to portray the world accurately and effectively convey information to the map reader. A legend explains the pictorial language of the map, known as its symbology. The title indicates the region the map portrays; the map image portrays the region and so on. Although every map element serves some purpose, convention only dictates inclusion of some elements, while others are considered optional. A menu of map elements includes the neatline (border), [[compass rose]] or north arrow, overview map, [[bar scale]], [[map projection|projection]] and information about the map sources, accuracy and publication.

When examining a landscape, scale can be intuited from trees, houses and cars. Not so with a map. Even such a simple thing as a north arrow is crucial. It may seem obvious that the top of a map should point north, but this might not be the case.

Color, likewise, is equally important. How the cartographer displays the data in different hues can greatly affect the understanding or feel of the map. Different intensities of hue portray different objectives the cartographer is attempting to get across to the audience. Today, personal computers can display up to 16 million distinct colors at a time (Jeer, 1997). This fact allows for a multitude of color options for even for the most demanding maps. Moreover, computers can easily hatch patterns in colors to give even more options. This is very beneficial, when symbolizing data in categories such as quintile and equal interval classifications.

Quantitative symbols give a visual measure of the relative size/importance/number that a symbol represents and to symbolize this data on a map, there are two major classes of symbols used for portraying quantitative properties. Proportional symbols change their visual weight according to a quantitative property. These are appropriate for extensive statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration (Harvard Graduate School of Design, 2005).

===Map generalization===
{{main|Cartographic generalization}}
A good map has to provide a compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the ''right place'' for the map [[scale (map)|scale]] used, against the need to annotate that item with text or a symbol, which takes up space on the map medium and very likely will cause some other item of interest to be displaced. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place - because of the demands of the annotation. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area), because relatively, the annotation on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads shown at scales of 1:1250 and 1:2500 were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250000 and 1:625000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.

==Cartographic errors==
Some maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as propaganda or as a &quot;[[watermark]]&quot; helping the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled &quot;[[trap streets]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0226534219 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another motive for deliberate errors is simply cartographic graffiti or prank: a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of drafts man Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.

'''Cardiac glycosides''' are [[medication|drugs]] used in the treatment of [[congestive heart failure]] and cardiac [[arrhythmia]]. These [[glycoside]]s are found as [[secondary metabolite]]s in several [[plant]]s, but also in some animals. [[File:Oleandrin.svg|thumb|Example of the chemical structure of [[oleandrin]], one of the cardiac glycosides.]]

==Function==
Cardiac glycosides are used therapeutically mainly in the treatment of cardiac failure. These effects are caused by the ability to increase [[cardiac output]] by increasing the [[Inotrope|force of contraction]] by increasing intracellular calcium as described below, increasing [[calcium-induced calcium release]] and thus contraction. Drugs such as [[ouabain]] and [[digoxin]] are cardiac glycosides. [[digoxin]] from the foxglove plant is used clinically, whereas [[ouabain]] is used only experimentally due to its extremely high potency.

Normally, [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pumps]] in the membrane of cells (in this case, [[cardiac myocytes]]) pump potassium ions in and sodium ions out. Cardiac glycosides inhibit this pump by stabilizing it in the E2-P transition state, so that sodium cannot be extruded: intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases. A second membrane ion exchanger, NCX, is responsible for 'pumping' calcium ions out of the cell and sodium ions in (3Na/Ca); raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit this pump, so calcium ions are not extruded and will also begin to build up inside the cell.

Increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations cause increased calcium uptake into the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] via the SERCA2 transporter. Raised calcium stores in the SR allow for greater calcium release on stimulation, so the myocyte can achieve faster and more powerful contraction by cross-bridge cycling. The refractory period of the AV node is increased, so cardiac glycosides also function to regulate heart rate. 

Binding of cardiac glycoside to Na-K ATPase is slow, and also, after binding, intracellular calcium increases gradually. Thus, the action of [[Digoxin | digitalis]] (even on [[Intravenous | IV injection]]) is delayed.
 
Raised extracellular potassium decreases binding of cardiac glycoside to Na-K ATPase.  Consequently, increased toxicity of these drugs is observed in the presence of [[Hypokalemia]].

If SR calcium stores become too high, some ions are released spontaneously through SR [[ryanodine receptor]]s. Then after-depolarization this effect leads initially to bigeminy: regular ectopic beats following each ventricular contraction. If higher glycoside doses are given, rhythm is lost and ventricular tachycardia ensues, followed by fibrillation.

==Examples==
Examples of plants producing cardiac glycosides:
* [[Cardenolide]] type:
** ''[[Strophanthus]]'' – [[ouabain]] g/k/e-strophanthin
** ''[[Digitalis]] lanata'' and ''Digitalis purpurea'' – [[digoxin]], [[digitoxin]]
** ''[[Nerium oleander]]'' - [[oleandrin]]
** ''[[Asclepias]] sp.''
* [[Bufadienolide]] type:
** ''[[Drimia maritima]]''
Examples of animals producing cardiac glycosides:
* Bufadienolide type:
** ''[[Bufo]]'' toads

:''See [[colony]] and [[colonization]] for examples of colonialism that do not refer to Western colonialism. Also see [[Colonization (disambiguation)]]

[[File:Musee-de-lArmee-IMG 0976.jpg|thumb|The [[pith helmet]] (in this case, of the [[Second French Empire]]) is an icon of colonialism in tropical lands]]

'''Colonialism''' is the establishment, maintenance, acquisition and expansion of [[colony|colonies]] in one territory by people from another territory. Colonialism is a process whereby [[sovereignty]] over the colony is claimed by the [[metropole]] and the [[social structure]], [[government]], and [[economics]] of the colony are changed by colonists - people from the metropole. Colonialism is a set of unequal relationships: between the metropole and the colony, and between the colonists and the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]].

The ''colonial period'' normally refers to a period of history from the late 15th to the 20th century when European [[nation state]]s established colonies on other continents. In this period, the justifications for colonialism included various factors such as the [[Profit (economics)|profits]] to be made, the expansion of the [[Power in international relations|power]] of the metropole and various religious and political beliefs.

Colonialism and [[imperialism]] were ideologically linked with [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref name=dk/&gt;

==Definitions==

''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' defines colonialism as &quot;the policy of acquiring and maintaining colonies, especially for exploitation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.collinslanguage.com/results.aspx?context=3&amp;reversed=False&amp;action=define&amp;homonym=0&amp;text=colonialism|title=Colonialism|year=2010|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary'' offers four definitions, including &quot;something characteristic of a colony&quot; and &quot;control by one power over a dependent area or people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colonialism|title=Colonialism|year=2010|work=Merriam-Webbster|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' &quot;uses the term 'colonialism' to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia.&quot; It discusses the distinction between colonialism and imperialism and states that &quot;[g]iven the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two terms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers to the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation movements of the 1960s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/|title=Colonialism|author=Margaret Kohn|year=2006|work= [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his preface to [[Jürgen Osterhammel]]'s ''Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview'', Roger Tignor says, &quot;For Osterhammel, the essence of colonialism is the existence of colonies, which are by definition governed differently from other territories such as protectorates or informal spheres of influence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tignor|first1=Roger|title=preface to Colonialism: a theoretical overview|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CMfksrnWaUkC&amp;pg=PR10#v=onepage |accessdate= 5 April 2010|year=2005|publisher=Markus Weiner Publishers|isbn=1558763406, 9781558763401|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Osterhammel asks, &quot;How can 'colonialism' be defined independently from 'colony?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osterhammel|first1=Jürgen|authorlink1=Jürgen Osterhammel |others=trans.

{{quote|Colonialism is a relationship between an indigenous (or forcibly imported) majority and a minority of foreign invaders.  The fundamental decisions affecting the lives of the colonised people are made and implemented by the colonial rulers in pursuit of interests that are often defined in a distant metropolis.

==Types of colonialism==
Historians often distinguish between two forms of colonialism, chiefly based on the number of people from the colonising country who settle in the colony*:
*[[Settler colonialism]] involved a large number of colonists, typically seeking fertile land to farm.
*[[Exploitation colonialism]] involved fewer colonists, typically interested in extracting resources to export to the [[metropole]]. This category includes [[trading posts]], but it applies more to the much larger colonies where the colonists would provide much of the administration and own much of the land and other [[capital (economics)|capital]], but rely on indigenous people for [[labour (economics)|labour]].

These models of colonialism overlap. In both cases, people moved to the colony, and goods were exported to the metropole.

A [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation colony]] is normally considered to fit the model of exploitation colonialism. However, in this case there may be other immigrants to the colony - [[Slavery|slaves]] to grow the [[cash crop]] for export.

In some cases, settler colonialism took place in substantially pre-populated areas and the result was either a culturally mixed population (such as the [[mestizo]]s of the [[Americas]]), or a racially divided population, such as in [[French Algeria]] or [[Southern Rhodesia]].

A [[League of Nations mandate]] was legally very different from a colony. However, there was some similarity with exploitation colonialism in the mandate system.

==History==
{{Main|History of colonialism|Chronology of colonialism}}
[[File:Colonisation 1800.png|thumb|300px|World map of colonialism in 1800]]
[[File:World 1914 empires colonies territory.PNG|thumb|300px|This map of the world in 1914 shows the large colonial empires that powerful nations established across the globe]]
[[File:Colonialism in 1945 updated legend.png|thumb|right|300px|World map of colonialism at the end of the Second World War in 1945]]

Activity that could be called colonialism has a long history. The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all built [[colonies in antiquity]]. The word &quot;metropole&quot; comes from the Greek ''metropolis'' [Greek: &quot;μητρόπολις&quot;]—&quot;mother city&quot;. The word &quot;colony&quot; comes from the Latin ''colonia''—&quot;a place for agriculture&quot;. Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] established military colonies south of their original territory and absorbed the territory, in a process known as [[History of Vietnam#Ming occupation and the rise of the Lê Dynasty|nam tiến]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern colonialism started with the [[Age of Discovery]]. [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] discovered new lands across the oceans and built trading posts. For some people, it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of [[expansionism]]. These new lands were divided between the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]], first by the papal bull [[Inter caetera]] and then by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] and the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]].

The 17th century saw the creation of the [[British Empire]], the [[French colonial empire]] and the [[Dutch Empire]]. It also saw the establishment of some [[Swedish overseas colonies]] and a [[Danish colonial empire]].

The spread of colonial empires was reduced in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. However, many new colonies were established after this time, including for the [[German colonial empire]] and [[Belgian colonial empire]]. In the late 19th century, many European powers were involved in the [[Scramble for Africa]].

The [[Russian Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Empire]] existed at the same time as the above empires, but did not expand over oceans. Rather, these empires expanded through the more traditional route of conquest of neighbouring territories. There was, though, some [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] across the Bering Strait. The [[Empire of Japan]] modelled itself on European colonial empires. The [[United States of America]] gained overseas territories after the [[Spanish-American War]] and the term &quot;[[American imperialism|American Empire]]&quot; was coined.

After the [[World War I|First World War]], the victorious [[Allies of World War I|allies]] divided up the German colonial empire and much of the Ottoman Empire between themselves as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. These territories were divided into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they would be ready for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/United-Nations/The-Trusteeship-Council-THE-MANDATE-SYSTEM-OF-THE-LEAGUE-OF-NATIONS.html|title=The Trusteeship Council - The mandate system of the league of nations
|year=2010|work=Encyclopedia of the Nations|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[decolonisation]] outside the Americas lagged until after the [[Second World War]]. In 1962 the [[United Nations]] set up a [[Special Committee on Decolonization]], often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process.

===Neocolonialism===
The term [[neocolonialism]] has been used to refer to a variety of things since the decolonisation efforts after [[World War II]]. Generally it does not refer to a type of colonialism but rather colonialism by other means. Specifically, the theory that the relationship between stronger and weaker countries is similar to [[exploitation colonialism]], without the stronger country having to build or maintain colonies. Such theories are based on economic relationships and interference in the politics of weaker countries by stronger countries.

==Colonialism and the history of thought==
{{Multiple issues|section=y|refimprove = September 2010|copyedit = September 2010|original research = September 2010}}

===Colonialism and geography===
Settlers acted as the link between the natives and the imperial hegemony, bridging the geographical gap between the colonisers and colonised. Painter, J. and Jeffrey, A. affirm that certain advances aided the expansion of European states. With tools such as cartography, shipbuilding, navigation, mining and agricultural productivity colonisers had an upper hand. Their awareness of the Earth's surface and abundance of practical skills provided colonisers with a knowledge that, in turn, created power. 

Painter and Jeffrey argue that geography was not and is not an objective science, rather it is based on assumptions of the physical world. It may have given “The West” an advantage when it came to exploration, however it also created zones of racial inferiority. Geographical beliefs such as environmental determinism, the view that some parts of the world are underdeveloped because of the climate, legitimised colonialism and created notions of skewed evolution.&lt;ref name=Painter&gt;&quot;Painter, J. &amp; Jeffrey, A., 2009. Political Geography 2nd ed., Sage. “Imperialism” pg 23 (GIC)&lt;/ref&gt; These are now seen as elementary concepts. Political geographers maintain that colonial behavior was reinforced by the physical mapping of the world, visually separating “them” and “us”. Geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism, more specifically, the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialism.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;Gallaher, C. et al., 2008. Key Concepts in Political Geography, Sage Publications Ltd. &quot;Imperialism/Colonialism&quot; pg 5 (GIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonialism and imperialism===
A colony is part of an empire and so colonialism is closely related to [[imperialism]]. The initial assumption is that colonialism and imperialism are interchangeable, however Robert Young suggests that imperialism is the concept while colonialism is the practice. Colonialism is based on an imperial outlook, thereby creating a consequential relationship between the two. Through an empire, colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded, on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire. In the next section Marxists make a case for this mutually reinforcing relationship.

===Marxist view of colonialism===
Marxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism, enforcing exploitation and social change. Working within the global capitalist system, colonialism is closely associated with uneven development, he thought. It is an “instrument of wholesale destruction, dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies, socio-psychological disorientation, massive poverty and neocolonial dependency.”&lt;ref name=Dic&gt;Dictionary of Human Geography, &quot;Colonialism&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Colonies are constructed into modes of production. The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for [[capital accumulation]]. Lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism, as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as [[Lyal S. Sunga]] explains: &quot;Vladimir Lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self-determination of peoples in his Theses on the Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism&quot; and he quotes Lenin who contended that &quot;The right of nations to self-determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense, the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation.  Specifically, this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In the Emerging System of International Criminal Law: Developments and Codification, Brill Publishers (1997) at page 90, Sunga traces the origin of the international movement against colonialism, and relates it to the rise of the right to self-determination in international law.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism, capitalism and colonialism===
[[Classical liberals]] generally opposed colonialism and imperialism, including [[Adam Smith]], [[Frederik Bastiat]], [[Richard Cobden]], John Bright, Henry Richard, [[Herbert Spencer]], H. R. Fox Bourne, Edward Morel, Josephine Butler, W. J. Fox and [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Moreover, [[American revolution]] was the first anti-colonial rebellion, inspiring others.&lt;ref name=dk&gt;[http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/PdfPapers/Liberalanti-imperialism.pdf Liberal Anti-Imperialism], professor Daniel Klein, 1.7.2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JNdavis&gt;[http://www.johannorberg.net/?page=displayblog&amp;month=09&amp;year=2004#409 Johannorberg.net] 2004-9-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] wrote in [[Wealth of Nations]] that Britain should liberate all of its colonies and also noted that it would be economically beneficial for British people in the average, although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose.&lt;ref name=dk/&gt;

The farmers in India under British colonial rule were also forced to grow certain crops, sell them to Britain, to pay oppressive taxes and so on.&lt;ref name=JNdavis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/1859843824/ Late Victorian Holocausts: El Niño Famines and the Making of the Third World], Mike Davis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-colonialism===
{{Main|Post-colonialism|Postcolonial literature}}

Post-colonialism (or post-colonial theory) can refer to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule. In this sense, postcolonial literature may be considered a branch of [[Postmodern literature]] concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires. Many practitioners take [[Edward Said]]'s book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) as the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] made similar claims decades before Said).

Edward Said analysed the works of [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Lautréamont]], exploring how they both absorbed and helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority. Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''[[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1998) gave its name to [[Subaltern Studies]].

In ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'' (1999), Spivak explored how major works of European [[metaphysics]] (such as those of [[Kant]] and [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]]. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, considers [[Western culture|Western civilization]] as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also allowed some traces of [[racialism]] to enter his work.

Debate about the perceived negative and positive aspects (spread of virulent [[Pandemic|diseases]], unequal social relations, exploitation, [[enslavement]], [[infrastructure]]s, [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]], new institutions, technological advancements and so on) of colonialism has occurred for centuries, amongst both coloniser and colonised, and continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713275,00.html Come Back, Colonialism, All is Forgiven]&lt;/ref&gt; The questions of [[miscegenation]]; the alleged ties between colonial enterprises, [[genocides]] &amp;mdash; see the [[Herero Genocide]] and the [[Armenian Genocide]] &amp;mdash; and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]; and the questions of the nature of imperialism, [[dependency theory]] and [[neocolonialism]] (in particular the [[Developing countries' debt|Third World debt]]) continue to retain their actuality.

The [[Stranger King]] is a relatively recent concept used to understand the process of colonisation.

===Impact on health===
{{See also|Globalization and disease|Columbian Exchange}}

Encounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases, which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth F. Kiple, ed. ''The Cambridge Historical Dictionary of Disease'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smallpox, measles, malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Crosby, Jr., ''The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Disease killed the entire native ([[Guanches]]) population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century. Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by [[smallpox]]. Smallpox also ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors. [[Measles]] killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century. In 1618–1619, smallpox wiped out 90% of the [[Massachusetts Bay]] Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9968/9968.ch01.html Smallpox The Fight to Eradicate a Global Scourge], David A. Koplow&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox epidemics in 1780–1782 and [[1837-38 smallpox epidemic|1837–1838]] brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the [[Plains Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2094753 &quot;The first smallpox epidemic on the Canadian Plains: In the fur-traders' words&quot;], National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|Native American population]] of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox – and other Deadly Eurasian Germs]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the Europeans had developed high degrees of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to these diseases, while the [[indigenous peoples]] had no such immunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/goodling.html Stacy Goodling, &quot;Effects of European Diseases on the Inhabitants of the New World&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Smallpox decimated the native population of [[Australia]], killing around 50% of [[Indigenous Australians]] in the early years of British colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox Through History|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257008292443871|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also killed many [[New Zealand]] [[Māori people|Māori]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canr.msu.edu/overseas/nzenvironsci/infopart2.htm New Zealand Historical Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1848–49, as many as 40,000 out of 150,000 [[Hawaii]]ans are estimated to have died of [[measles]], [[whooping cough]] and [[influenza]]. Introduced diseases, notably smallpox, nearly wiped out the native population of [[Easter Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-did-easter-islands-ancient-statues-lead-to-the-destruction-of-an-entire-ecosystem-455877.html How did Easter Island's ancient statues lead to the destruction of an entire ecosystem?], The Independent&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, [[measles]] killed over 40,000 [[Fiji]]ans, approximately one-third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsm.ac.fj/aboutfsm.html Fiji School of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ainu people|Ainu]] population decreased drastically in the 19th century, due in large part
to infectious diseases brought by Japanese settlers pouring into [[Hokkaido]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ontheroad/japan.sapporo.ainu.html Meeting the First Inhabitants], TIMEasia.com, 21 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers concluded that [[syphilis]] was carried from the New World to Europe after [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s voyages. The findings suggested Europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home, where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15syph.html?_r=1 Genetic Study Bolsters Columbus Link to Syphilis], New York Times, January 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The disease was more frequently fatal than it is today.

As early as 1803, the [[Spain|Spanish]] Crown organised a mission (the [[Balmis expedition]]) to transport the smallpox vaccine to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]], and establish mass vaccination programs there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doh.gov.ph/sphh/balmis.htm Dr. Francisco de Balmis and his Mission of Mercy, Society of Philippine Health History]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1832, the federal government of the [[United States]] established a [[Smallpox vaccine|smallpox vaccination]] program for Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/wicazo_sa_review/v018/18.2pearson01.html Lewis Cass and the Politics of Disease: The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] a program was launched to propagate [[smallpox vaccination]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallpoxhistory.ucl.ac.uk/Other%20Asia/ongoingwork.htm Smallpox History - Other histories of smallpox in South Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the 20th century onwards, the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&amp;EventId=696 Conquest and Disease or Colonialism and Health?], Gresham College | Lectures and Events&lt;/ref&gt; The [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the world saw the biggest increase in its population in [[human history]] due to lessening of the [[mortality rate]] in many countries due to [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/182701 The Origins of African Population Growth, by John Iliffe], The Journal of African HistoryVol. 30, No. 1 (1989), pp. 165-169&lt;/ref&gt; [[World population]] has grown from 1.6 billion in 1900 to an estimated 6.7 billion today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldometers.info/population/ World Population Clock - Worldometers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that discussion of how diseases were spread has been scuttled by descendants of colonialists to conceal actual origins of how indigenous populations were inoculated with these new diseases. An argument here is that once European colonists discovered indigenous populations were not immune to certain diseases, they deliberately spread diseases to gain military advantages and subjugate local peoples. The most infamous case involves suggestions by Lord Jeffery Amherst,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.college.ucla.edu/webproject/micro12/webpages/indianssmallpox.html&lt;/ref&gt; though history is mute on whether his barbaric suggestions were carried out. Many scholars have argued that evidence that supports this practice as having been executed on a larger scale across North America is weak. Yet, growing evidence is showing that other indigenous communities were purposefully inoculated, citing oral history from the descendants of said peoples. It has been regarded as one of the first instances of bio-terrorism or use of biological weapons in the history of warfare. For further information see&lt;ref&gt;Ann F. Ramenofsky, Vectors of Death: The Archaeology of European Contact (Albuquerque, NM: University of New Mexico Press, 1987):&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. O'Connell, Of Arms and Men: A History of War, Weapons, and Aggression (NY and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, only one documented case of germ warfare, involving British commander Jeffrey Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Casablanca''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''الدار البيضاء''' &quot;ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ&quot;, original name in [[Berber languages|Amazigh]]: '''Anfa /[[File:Anfa picture.jpg]]''') is a [[city]] in western [[Morocco]], located on the Atlantic Ocean. It is the capital of the [[Grand Casablanca]] region.

Casablanca is Morocco's largest city as well as its chief [[port]]. It is also the biggest city in the [[Maghreb]]. The 2004 census recorded a population of 2,949,805 in the prefecture of Casablanca and 3,631,061 in the region of [[Grand Casablanca]]. Casablanca is considered the economic and business centre of Morocco, while the political [[Capital (political)|capital]] city of Morocco is [[Rabat]].

Casablanca hosts headquarters and main industrial facilities for the leading Moroccan and international companies based in Morocco. Industrial statistics show Casablanca retains its historical position as the main industrial zone of the country. The [[Port of Casablanca]] is one of the largest artificial ports in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;EotO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/casablan.htm |title='&amp;#39;Casablanca'&amp;#39; - '&amp;#39;Encyclopedia of the Orient'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest port of [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-ata.org/mc_casablanca.htm |title='&amp;#39;Discovering Casablanca'&amp;#39; |publisher=Africa-ata.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the primary naval base for the [[Royal Moroccan Navy]].

== Etymology ==
The Latinized name of the city is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word combination meaning 'White House' (''blanca'', 'white;' ''casa'', 'house'). It is thought that the Spaniards adopted the name from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] '''Casa Branca'''. The city is now nicknamed '''Casa''' by many locals.

The [[Berber languages|Berber]] original name, (meaning: &quot;hill&quot; in English), was used by the [[Anfa|local]], and Berber-speaking, city dwellers until the French occupation army entered the city in 1907 and adopted the Spanish name, Casablanca. &quot;Anfa&quot; now refers to the original old city quarters of Casablanca.

Legally speaking, Anfa is considered by the Moroccans as a prefecture (a district) with 0.5 million city dwellers, and is thus a part of the Grand Casablanca.

One of Casablanca's two airports is called [[Casablanca-Anfa Airport]], the other [[Mohammed V International Airport]].

== Geography ==
Casablanca is located in the Chawiya plain which has historically been the breadbasket of Morocco.

Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of [[Eucalyptus]] and [[Pine]] trees. It is located half way to the city's international airport.

The only watercourse in Casablanca is Oued Bouskoura, a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the actual port. Most of Oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of [[El-Jadida]] road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is [[Oum Er-Rbia River]] {{convert|70|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} to the south-east.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Casablanca}}

=== Before the French Protectorate ===
The area which is today Casablanca was settled by [[Berber people|Berbers]] by at least the 7th century BC.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Casablanca.html |title='&amp;#39;Casablanca'&amp;#39; |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans.&lt;ref name=lexic&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://www.lexicorient.com/e.o/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca - LookLex Encyclopaedia |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''In his book “Wasf Afriquia” Hassan Al Wazan refers to &quot;Anfa&quot; (ancient Casablanca) as a great city which was founded by the Romans. He also believed that Anfa was the most prosperous city on the Atlantic coast because of its fertile land.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/historymuseum/creatingcommunity.shtml |title=Museum of History &amp; Holocaust Education: Creating Community Collaboration |publisher=Kennesaw.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A small independent kingdom, in the area then named [[Anfa]], arose around late Roman time in response to Arab [[Muslim]] rule, and continued until it was conquered by the [[Almoravid]]s in 1068.
[[File:Casablanca SPOT 1208.jpg|thumb|Casablanca seen from Spot Satellite]]

During the 14th century, under the [[Merinid]]s, Anfa rose in importance as a port. In the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who destroyed the town in 1468.

The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called &quot;Casa Branca&quot;, meaning &quot;white house&quot; in Portuguese.

Between 1580-1640, Casablanca was part of Spain, and later it became part of Portugal again. The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an [[earthquake]] which destroyed most of the town.

The town was finally reconstructed by [[sultan]] [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] (1756–1790), the grandson of [[Moulay Ismail]] and ally of [[George Washington]] with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called '''الدار البيضاء''' ''ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation of the Spanish ''Casa Blanca'', meaning &quot;white house&quot;).

In the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing Morocco's now famous national drink, [[gunpowder tea]]). By the 1860s, there were around 5,000 residents, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 121&lt;/ref&gt; Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of [[French colonial empires|French colonialists]] in the town, at first administrators within a sovereign sultanate, in 1906. By 1921, this was to rise to 110,000,&lt;ref&gt;Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 149&lt;/ref&gt; largely through the development of ''[[shanty town|bidonvilles]]''.

=== French rule ===
{{Main|French protectorate of Morocco}}
[[File:Boulevard de Paris, Casablanca.jpg|thumb|upright|A view on the Boulevard de Paris in central Casablanca]]
[[File:Casablanca1950s.jpg|thumb|Boulevard Mohamed el Hansali in 1950s]]
In June 1907, the French attempted to build a [[light railway]] near the port and passing through a graveyard. Residents attacked the French, and riots ensued. French troops were landed in order to restore order, which was achieved only after severe damage to the town. The French then took control of Casablanca. This effectively began the process of colonization, although French control of Casablanca was not formalised until 1910.

The famous 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' underlined the city's colonial status at the time—depicting it as the scene of a power struggle between competing European powers, carried out with little reference to the local population. The film's vast cosmopolitan cast of characters (American, French, German, Czech, Norwegian, Bulgarian, Russian and some other nationalities) includes only a single (uncredited) local character, &quot;Abdul&quot; the doorman whose role is marginal.

Europeans formed almost half the population.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of the Arab peoples]''&quot;. Harvard University Press. p.323. ISBN 0674010175&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting. A bomb attack on Christmas Day of 1953 caused many casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Dead in Casablanca Blast |author= |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 December 1953 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C12FF3E59177B93C7AB1789D95F478585F9&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=casablanca+bomb&amp;st=p |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Casablanca Conference ===
Casablanca was an important strategic port during [[World War II]] and hosted the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] in 1943, in which [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] discussed the progress of the war. Casablanca was the site of a large American air base, which was the staging area for all American aircraft for the [[European Theater of Operations]] during [[World War II]].

=== Since independence ===
Morocco gained independence from France on March 2, 1956.

In 1930, Casablanca hosted a Grand Prix. The race was held at the new [[Ain-Diab Circuit|Anfa Racecourse]]. In 1958, the race was held at [[Ain-Diab]] circuit - ''(see [[Moroccan Grand Prix]])''. In 1983, Casablanca hosted the [[Mediterranean Games]].

The city is now developing a tourism industry. Casablanca has become the economic and business capital of Morocco, while [[Rabat]] is the political capital.

In March 2000, women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on [[polygamy]] and the introduction of [[Talaq (Nikah)|divorce law]] (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]], and he enacted a new ''[[Mudawana]]'', or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.

On May 16, 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a [[2003 Casablanca bombings|multiple suicide bomb attack]] carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to [[al-Qaeda]].

A string of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. A suspected militant blew himself up at a Casablanca internet cafe on March 11, 2007. On April 10, three suicide bombers blew themselves up during a police raid of their safe house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1260317,00.html |title=Terror Cell: 'Police Hold Fifth Man' |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, police set up barricades around the city and detained two more men who had escaped the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=nw20070412144633223C139447 |title=Casablanca on alert after suicide bombings |publisher=Iol.co.za |date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, two brothers blew themselves up in downtown Casablanca, one near the American Consulate, and one a few blocks away near the American Language Center. Only one person was injured aside from the bombers, but the Consulate was closed for more than a month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3044022 U.S. Shuts Morocco Consulate After Bomb]{{dead link|date=August 2010}} April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==

Casablanca has a very mild [[mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh''). Most precipitation falls from November to March. See table below.
Casablanca's climate is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Atlantic Ocean which tends to moderate temperature swings and produce a remarkably mild climate with little seasonal temperature variation and a lack of extreme heat and extreme cold.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Casablanca}}
The [[Grand Casablanca]] region is considered the locomotive of the development of the [[Economy of Morocco|Moroccan economy]]. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of [[industrial labor]]. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the Industrial production of the Kingdom. 33% of national industrial exportations, MAD 27 billions, which is comparably with US $3.6 billion, come from the Grand Casablanca. 30% of Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casablanca.ma/Detail.aspx?folder=14&amp;id=268 Casablanca, poumon économique du Maroc]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casainvest.ma/casainvest/tabid/55/Default.aspx |title=Les bonnes raisons d’investir à Casablanca |publisher=Casainvest.ma |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmilling, furniture making, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topbladi.com/villes/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca , capitale economique du Maroc |publisher=Topbladi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port of Casablanca|Casablanca]] and [[Mohammedia]] seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://looklex.com/e.o/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca - LookLex Encyclopaedia |publisher=Looklex.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost the entire Casablanca coast is under project, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan 2nd Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near Megarama cinema which is a business, entertainment and living centre, Morocco Mall, a giant shopping and entertainment complex, and finally a complete renovation of the coastal walkway to be finished in June 2009. The Sindbad park is planned to be totally renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casainvest.ma/ |title=votre partenaire pour investir à Casablanca au Maroc |publisher=CasaInvest.ma |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
The population of Grand Casablanca was estimated in 2005 at 3.85 million. 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total [[Demographics of Morocco|population of Morocco]]. [[Grand Casablanca]] is also the largest [[urban area]] in the [[Maghreb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casablanca.ma/Detail.aspx?folder=14&amp;id=339 Casablanca.ma]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of inhabitants is however disputed by the locals, who point to a number between 5 and 6 million{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, citing recent drought years as a reason for many people moving into the city to find work.

=== Judaism in Casablanca ===

There was a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in Anfa up to its destruction by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750 the Rabbi Elijah [[Synagogue]] was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;

The French period New Town of Casablanca was designed by the French architect [[Henri Prost]] and was a model of a [[planned community|new town]] at that time. The main streets of the New Town (''Ville Nouvelle'' in French) radiate south and east from Place des Nations Unies, where the main market of Anfa had been. The New Town is possibly the most impressive in Morocco. Former administrative buildings and modern hotels populate the area. Their style is a combination of [[Hispanic-Moorish style|Hispano-Mauresque]] and [[Art Deco]] styles.

Casablanca is home to the [[Hassan II Mosque]], designed by the French architect [[Michel Pinseau]]. It is situated on a [[promontory]] looking out to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], which can be seen through a gigantic glass floor with room for 25,000 worshippers. A further 80,000 can be accommodated in the mosque's courtyard. Its [[minaret]] is the world's tallest at 210 metres. The mosque is also the largest in North Africa, and the third largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque |title=Hassan II Mosque in Morocco, Morocco |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the mosque was started in 1980, and was intended to be completed for the 60th birthday of the former [[King of Morocco|Moroccan king]], [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]], in 1989. However, the building was not inaugurated until 1993. Authorities spent an estimated $800 million in the construction of the building.

The ''Parc de la Ligue Arabe'' (formally called ''Lyautey'') is the city's largest [[public park]]. On its edge is situated [[Casablanca Cathedral]] (Cathédrale Sacré-Coeur), which is disused, but is a splendid example of ''[[Moorish Revival|Mauresque]]'' architecture.

The Old Medina (the part of town pre-dating the French [[protectorate]]) attracts fewer tourists than the [[Medina quarter|medinas]] of other Moroccan towns, such as [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Marrakech]]. However, it has undergone some restoration in recent years. Included in this project have been the western walls of the medina, its ''skala'', or [[bastion]], and its colonial-period clock tower.

A popular site among locals is &quot;The Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane&quot;. This is on a small rocky island off the coast of Casablanca and can only be reached when the tide is low. This outcrop, is where the tomb of Sidi Abderrhamane Thaalibi, original founder of Algiers, is located. He is considered a saint by most people of Morocco&lt;http://www.morocco.com/blog/visiting-the-venerated-site-of-marabout-de-sidi-abderrahmane&gt;.  Because of his status as a saint, many people of Morocco make informal pilgrimages to this site &quot;to reflect on life and to seek religious enlightenment&quot;. Some believe that the saint possessed magical powers and so his tomb still possesses these powers. People come and seek this magic in order to be cured &lt;http://www.hotelsmaroc.org/marabout_sidi_abderrahmane&gt;.

== Transport ==
=== Air ===
Casablanca's main airport is [[Mohammed V International Airport]], Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], [[Agadir]], [[Oujda]], and [[Tangier]], [[Laayoune]] as well as other cities.

Casablanca is well served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. [[New York]], [[Dakar]] and [[Dubai]] are important primary destinations.

The older, smaller [[Casablanca-Anfa Airport]] to the west of the city, that served certain destinations including [[Damascus]], and [[Tunis]], was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It currently services domestic flights and freight.

=== Coaches ===
CTM coaches (intercity buses) and various private lines run services to most notable Moroccan towns as well as a number of European cities. These run from the Gare Routière on Rue Léon l'Africain in downtown Casablanca.

=== Metro ===
An underground railway system is currently being projected, which when constructed will potentially offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. The metro will not be ready before 2017, having a length of {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} and costing 46.7 billion dirhams (approximately 5.8 billion USD).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casablanca.ma/index/docs/deplacement_urbain_casa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noticed that none of the preparatory works for this project have started. In addition, no discussion of it has been observed in the media. The anecdote among Casablanca population is that &quot;water is too near below, that they cannot dig tunnels.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Taxis ===

[[File:Casablanca AerialView.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Casablanca]]
{{See also|Taxicabs of Morocco}}
Registered [[Taxicab|taxis]] in Casablanca are coloured red and known as ''petits taxis'' (''small taxis''), or coloured white and known as ''grands taxis'' (''big taxis''). As is standard Moroccan practice, ''petits taxis,'' typically small-four door [[Fiat Uno]] or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. ''Grands taxis,'' generally older [[Mercedes-Benz]] sedans, provide shared [[mini-bus]] like service within the city on pre-defined routes, or shared inter-city service. Grands Taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day, although typically only foreigners do so.

=== Trains ===
Casablanca is served by two rail stations run by the national rail service, the [[ONCF]]. The main long haul station is Casa-Voyageurs, from which trains run south to [[Marrakech]] or [[El Jadida]] and north to [[Mohammedia]] and [[Rabat]], and then on either to [[Tangier]] or [[Meknes]], [[Fes]], Taza and [[Oujda]]. A dedicated airport shuttle service to [[Mohammed V International Airport]] also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.

The second station, Casa-Port, serves primarily commuter trains running the Casablanca - [[Kenitra]] corridor, with some connecting trains with running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. www.oncf.ma

=== Tram ===
A [[Casablanca tram|tram system]] is currently under construction should open in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/casablanca-tram-contracts-awarded.html|accessdate=2010-11-17|publisher=Railway Gazette|title=Casablanca tram contracts awarded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative divisions ==

Casablanca is a commune, part of the Region of the [[Grand Casablanca]]. The commune is divided into 8 districts (prefectures عمالات), which are themselves divided into 16 subdivisions (arrondissements دوائر) and 1 municipality (بلدية).

[[File:Cross2.svg|thumb|150px|A ''Greek cross'' (all arms of equal length) above a ''[[saltire]]'', a cross whose limbs are slanted]]
A '''cross''' is a geometrical figure consisting of two lines or bars perpendicular to each other, dividing one or two of the lines in half. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally; if they run obliquely, the design is technically termed a [[saltire]], although the arms of a saltire need not meet at right angles.

The cross is one of the most ancient human symbols, and is used by many religions, such as [[Christian cross|Christianity]]. It is frequently a representation of the division of the world into [[classical element|four elements]] (Chevalier, 1997) or [[cardinal directions|cardinal points]], or alternately as the union of the concepts of [[divinity]], the vertical line, and the [[world]], the horizontal line (Koch, 1955).

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[:wikt:cross|cross]]'' comes ultimately from [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:crux|crux]]'', a Roman torture device used for [[crucifixion]], via [[Old Irish]] ''cros''. The word was introduced to English in the 10th century as the term for the instrument of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|torturous execution of Jesus]] as described in the [[New Testament]], gradually replacing the earlier word ''[[rood]]''.

== History ==
[[File:Zbruch Idol Detail-2.jpg|thumb|200px|Solar cross in ''[[Zbruch Idol]]'']]It is not known when the first cross image was made; after circles, crosses are one of the first symbols drawn by children of all cultures. There are many cross-shaped [[Petroglyph|incisions]] in European cult caves, dating back to the earliest stages of human cultural development in the [[stone age]]. Like other symbols from this period, their use continued in the [[Celt]]ic and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] cultures in Europe. For example, celtic coins minted many centuries before the Christian era may have an entire side showing this type of cross, sometimes with the cardinal points marked by concave depressions in the same style as in stone age carvings. Other coins may be showing the cross held by a rider on a horse and springing  a fern leaf, sometimes identified as a [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]] symbol.

Written crosses are used for many different purposes, particularly in mathematics.

* The [[Roman numeral]] for [[10 (number)|ten]] is [[X]].
* In the [[Latin alphabet]], the letter [[X]] and the [[Loer case|minuscule]] form of [[t]] are crosses.
* The [[Chinese character]] for ten is [[wikt:十|十]] (see [[Chinese numerals]]).
* The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] or ''obelus'' (†) is a cross
* The [[addition]] (or ''plus'') sign (+) and the [[multiplication]] (or ''times'') sign (×) are cross shapes.
* A cross is often used as a [[check mark]] because it can be clearer, easier to create with an ordinary pen or pencil, and less obscuring of any text or image that is already present than a large dot. It also allows marking a position more accurately than a large dot.
* A large cross through a text often means that it is wrong or should be considered deleted. A cross is also use stand-alone ([[✗]]) to denote rejection.

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:Serbian_Cross1.svg|140px]]
| | '''[[Serbian cross]]''' (Tetragrammatic cross)
|
The motif of a cross between objects is perhaps derived from [[Constantine I|Constantine's]] [[labarum]] and has figured on [[Byzantine]] coins, since the 6th c. Later, the 4 symbols of the cross have been interpreted as flints or firestones, but also as the initials (letters β) of the imperial motto of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologos dynasty]]: King of Kings, Ruling Over Kings (Greek: βασιλεύς βασιλέων, βασιλεύων βασιλευόντων—Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn). The cross has been used by [[History of Serbia|Serbian]] states and the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] since the Middle Ages after [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Dušan the Mighty]] was crowned Emperor (Tsar) of the [[Serbs]] and [[Greeks]] (16 April 1345). Today it is the national, religious and ethnic symbol of [[Serbs]] and [[Serbia]]. 
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:FlorianCross 1.svg|120px]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:FlorianCross 2.svg|120px]]
| | '''Florian cross'''
|
Adopted as an emblem by the fire service, this cross is named for [[Saint Florian]], the patron saint of [[Poland]], [[Austria]] and [[firefighters]]. Although similar to the [[Maltese Cross]] and [[Cross pattée]], it differs in having arms rounded outwards at the ends. Two different versions are included here; the one above is commonly found on fire service badges, patches, and emblems; the one below is typical of the St. Florian medallion or medal.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:Slavcross.png|85px]]
| | '''[[Eastern cross]]'''
|
Used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The top line is said to represent the headboard, and the bottom, slanted line represents the footrest, wrenched loose by Jesus' writhing in intense agony. It is raised to the left side, because that was the side of the righteous criminal who said to Jesus: &quot;remember me when you come into your kingdom&quot;. This symbolises the victory of good over evil.  The letters IC XC found at the end of the main arm of most Eastern Orthodox Crosses are a [[Christogram]], representing the name of Jesus Christ ({{lang-gr|Ιησούς Χριστός}}).  See also the [[Cross of Salem]].
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:St Brigid.png|120px]]
| | '''[[St. Brigid's Cross]]'''
|
This cross is found throughout Ireland. It is told that Brigid, daughter of a pagan king, made the cross from reeds to be used as an instrument of conversion. However, Brigid's name is derived from Brigit (also spelled Brigid, Brìghde, Brìde, and Bríde), a Celtic Goddess of fire, poetry, and smithcraft, and today the cross is used to protect houses from fire. This is an example of the integration of religious traditions.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:Labarum.png|120px]]
| | '''[[Chi-Rho]]'''
|
[[Constantine I]]'s emblem, the Chi-Rho (from the two [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] that make it up) is also known as the ''[[labarum]]''  or [[Christogram]]. Several variants exist.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:Croix de Lorraine.png|75px]]
| | '''[[Cross of Lorraine|Lorraine Cross]]'''
|

Is part of the heraldic arms of Lorraine in eastern France. It was originally held to be a symbol of [[Joan of Arc]], renowned for her perseverance against foreign invaders of France.
|-

|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:Celtic-style crossed circle.svg|120px]]
| |Neolithic cross, later adapted to form the [[Celtic Cross]]
|
A sun cross with the arms of the cross extended beyond the perimeter of the circle. This symbol was adopted by many Christians, who often extended the lower arm in the manner of a Christian cross, creating what is now known as a Celtic cross. Some [[white nationalist]] and [[neo-fascist]] groups adopted this variation of the [[Celtic cross]], made up of simple lines, without any of the ornamental complexity of traditional Celtic crosses. It is thought that this basic variation's minor resemblance to the [[swastika]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} is the reason it has become popular in such circles. This variation was also used by the [[Zodiac killer]] at the scenes of his crimes.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:Swastika.png|100px]]
| | '''[[Swastika]]'''
|
The '''swastika''' is an [[equilateral]] cross with its arms bent at [[Angle#Types of angles|right angles]], in either right-facing ({{script|Hant|卐}}) form or its mirrored left-facing ({{script|Hant|卍}}) form.

Archaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments dates from the [[Neolithic]] period. It occurs mainly in the modern day [[culture of India]], sometimes as a geometrical motif and sometimes as a religious symbol. It remains widely used in [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] and [[Dharmic religion]]s such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].
Though once commonly used all over much of the world without stigma, because of its right-facing variant's iconic usage in [[Nazi Germany]], the symbol has become stigmatized in the [[Western world]].

A cross which does not extend to the edges of the shield is ''couped'' or ''humetty'', in heraldic terminology, as in the [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=75&amp;ShowAll=1 coat, flag and badge of Geiger], Canada; it is shown with all its limbs of equal length and is also sometimes called a Greek cross.

There are numerous other variations on the cross in heraldry. See [[heraldry]] for background information.

James Parker's [http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglossc.htm#Cross ''A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry'' (1894)] is online, and contains much information about variants of crosses used in heraldry.

== In flags ==
{{main|flag terminology}}
Several flags have crosses, including all the nations of [[Scandinavia]], whose crosses are known as [[Nordic Cross flag|Scandinavian crosses]], and many nations in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which incorporate the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]. The [[Flag of Switzerland]] since the 17th century has displayed an equilateral cross in a square (the only [[Gallery of square flags|square flag]] of a sovereign state apart from the [[Flag of the Vatican City]]); the [[Red Cross]] emblem was based on the Swiss flag.

In [[chemistry]], a '''coordination complex''' or '''metal complex''', is a structure consisting of a central atom or ion (usually metallic), [[chemical bond|bonded]] to a surrounding array of molecules or anions ([[ligand]]s, complexing agents).&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01203.html IUPAC definition of complex]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01330.html IUPAC definition of coordination entity]&lt;/ref&gt;The atom within a ligand that is directly bonded to the central atom or ion is called the '''donor atom'''. [[Ligand#Polydentate and polyhapto ligand motifs and nomenclature|Polydentate]] (multiple bonded) ligands can form a [[chelate complex]]. A ligand donates at least one [[lone pair|pair of electrons]] to the central atom/ion.

Compounds that contain a coordination complex are called '''coordination compounds'''. The central atom or ion, together with all ligands form the [[coordination sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemistry-dictionary.com/definition/coordination+sphere.php chemistry-dictionary.com - Definition of coordination sphere]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/cchem/whatis.html ''What Is A Coordination Compound?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coordination''' refers to the &quot;coordinate covalent bonds&quot; ([[dipolar bond]]s) between the ligands and the central atom. Originally, a complex implied a reversible association of [[molecule]]s, [[atom]]s, or [[ion]]s through such weak [[chemical bond]]s. As applied to coordination chemistry, this meaning has evolved. Some metal complexes are formed virtually irreversibly and many are bound together by bonds that are quite strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0471199575, 9780471199571|pages=1355|last=Cotton|first=Frank Albert|coauthors=Geoffrey Wilkinson, Carlos A.

==History==
{{main|Alfred Werner}}
[[File:Hexol-2D-wedged.png|thumb|Structure of hexol]]
Coordination complexes were known - although not understood in any sense - since the beginning of chemistry, e.g. [[Prussian blue]] and [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper vitriol]]. The key breakthrough occurred when [[Alfred Werner]] proposed in 1893 that Co(III) bears six [[ligands]] in an octahedral geometry. His theory allows one to understand the difference between coordinated and ionic in a compound, for example chloride in the cobalt [[ammine]] chlorides and to explain many of the previously inexplicable isomers.

In 1914, Werner resolved the first coordination complex, called [[hexol]], into optical isomers, overthrowing the theory that [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] was necessarily associated with carbon compounds.

==Structure of coordination complexes==
The ions or molecules surrounding the central atom are called [[ligand|ligands]]. Ligands are generally bound to the central atom by a [[coordinate covalent bond]] (donating electrons from a [[lone pair|lone electron pair]] into an empty metal orbital), and are said to be '''coordinated''' to the atom. There are also organic ligands such as [[alkene]]s whose [[pi bonds]] can coordinate to empty metal orbitals. An example is [[ethene]] in the complex known as [[Zeise's salt]], K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[PtCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Geometry===
In coordination chemistry, a structure is first described by its [[coordination number]], the number of ligands attached to the metal (more specifically, the number of σ-type bonds between ligand(s) and the central atom). Usually one can count the ligands attached, but sometimes even the counting can become ambiguous. Coordination numbers are normally between two and nine, but large numbers of ligands are not uncommon for the lanthanides and actinides. The number of bonds depends on the size, charge, and [[electron configuration]] of the metal ion and the ligands. Metal ions may have more than one coordination number.

Typically the chemistry of complexes is dominated by interactions between s and p [[molecular orbital]]s of the ligands and the d orbitals of the metal ions.  The s, p, f, and d orbitals of the metal can accommodate 18 electrons (see [[18-Electron rule]]; for f-block elements, this extends to 32 electrons). The maximum coordination number for a certain metal is thus related to the electronic configuration of the metal ion (more specifically, the number of empty orbitals) and to the ratio of the size of the ligands and the metal ion. Large metals and small ligands lead to high coordination numbers, e.g. [Mo(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;. Small metals with large ligands lead to low coordination numbers, e.g. Pt[P(CMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Due to their large size, [[lanthanide]]s, [[actinide]]s, and early transition metals tend to have high coordination numbers.

Different ligand structural arrangements result from the coordination number. Most structures follow the points-on-a-sphere pattern (or, as if the central atom were in the middle of a [[polyhedron]] where the corners of that shape are the locations of the ligands), where orbital overlap (between ligand and metal orbitals) and ligand-ligand repulsions tend to lead to certain regular geometries. The most observed geometries are listed below, but there are many cases which deviate from a regular geometry, e.g. due to the use of ligands of different types (which results in irregular bond lengths; the coordination atoms do not follow a points-on-a-sphere pattern), due to the size of ligands, or due to [[electronic effect]]s (see e.g. [[Jahn-Teller distortion]]):

*[[Linear molecular geometry|Linear]] for two-coordination,
*[[Trigonal planar]] for three-coordination,
*[[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|Tetrahedral]] or [[square planar]] for four-coordination
*[[Trigonal bipyramid molecular geometry|Trigonal bipyramidal]] or [[Square pyramidal molecular geometry|square pyramid]]al for five-coordination,
*[[Octahedral molecular geometry|Octahedral]] (orthogonal) or [[prism (geometry)|trigonal prismatic]] for six-coordination,
*[[Pentagonal bipyramid]]al for seven-coordination,
*[[Square antiprism]]atic for eight-coordination, and
*[[Triaugmented triangular prism|Tri-capped trigonal prismatic]] (Triaugmented triangular prism) for nine coordination.

Some exceptions and provisions should be noted:
*The idealized descriptions of 5-, 7-, 8-, and 9- coordination are often indistinct geometrically from alternative structures with slightly different L-M-L (ligand-metal-ligand) angles. The classic example of this is the difference between square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal structures.
*Due to special electronic effects such as (second-order) [[Jahn-Teller distortion|Jahn-Teller]] stabilization, certain geometries are stabilized relative to the other possibilities, e.g. for some compounds the trigonal prismatic geometry is stabilized relative to octahedral structures for six-coordination.

===Isomerism===
The arrangement of the ligands is fixed for a given complex, but in some cases it is mutable by a reaction that forms another stable [[isomer]].

There exist many kinds of [[isomerism]] in coordination complexes, just as in many other compounds.

====Stereoisomerism====
[[Stereoisomerism]] occurs with the same bonds in different orientations relative to one another. Stereoisomerism can be further classified into:

=====Cis-trans isomerism and facial-meridional isomerism=====
[[Cis-trans isomerism]] occurs in [[octahedral]] and [[plane (mathematics)|square planar]] complexes (but not tetrahedral). When two ligands are mutually adjacent they are said to be '''cis''', when 
opposite each other, '''trans'''. When three identical ligands occupy one face of an octahedron, the isomer is said to be facial, or '''fac'''. In a ''fac'' isomer, any two  identical ligands are adjacent or ''cis'' to each other. If these three ligands and the metal ion are in one plane, the isomer is said to be meridional, or '''mer'''. A ''mer'' isomer can be considered as a combination of a ''trans'' and a ''cis'', since it contains both trans and cis pairs of identical ligands.

Image:Trans-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|''trans''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Image:Fac-trichlorotriamminecobalt(III).png|''fac''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=====Optical isomerism=====
[[Optical isomerism]] occurs when the mirror image of a compound is not superimposable with the original compound.  It is so called because such isomers are [[optically active]], that is, they rotate the plane of [[polarized light]].  The symbol Λ (''lambda'') is used as a prefix to describe the left-handed propeller twist formed by three bidentate ligands, as shown.  Similarly, the symbol Δ (''delta'') is used as a prefix for the right-handed propeller twist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0138418918, 9780138418915|pages=642|last=Miessler|first=Gary L.|coauthors=Donald Arthur Tarr|title=Inorganic Chemistry|year=1999|pages=315, 316|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

====Structural isomerism====
[[Structural isomerism]] occurs when the bonds are themselves different. [[Linkage isomer]]ism is only one of several types of structural isomerism in coordination complexes (as well as other classes of chemical compounds).  Linkage isomerism occurs with ambidentate ligands which can bind in more than one place.  For example, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an ambidentate ligand: it can bind to a metal at either the N atom or at an O atom.

==Electronic properties of metal complexes==
Many of the properties of metal complexes are dictated by their electronic structures. The electronic structure can be described by a relatively ionic model that ascribes formal charges to the metals and ligands. This approach is the essence of [[crystal field theory]] (CFT).  Crystal field theory, introduced by [[Hans Bethe]] in 1929, gives a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanically]] based attempt at understanding complexes.  But crystal field theory treats all interactions in a complex as ionic and assumes that the ligands can be approximated by negative point charges.

More sophisticated models embrace covalency, and this approach is described by [[ligand field theory]] (LFT) and [[Molecular orbital theory]] (MO). Ligand field theory, introduced in 1935 and built from molecular orbital theory, can handle a broader range of complexes and can explain complexes in which the interactions are [[covalent]]. The chemical applications of [[group theory]] can aid in the understanding of crystal or ligand field theory, by allowing simple, symmetry based solutions to the formal equations.

Chemists tend to employ the simplest model required to predict the properties of interest; for this reason, CFT has been a favorite for the discussions when possible. MO and LF theories are more complicated, but provide a more realistic perspective.

The electronic configuration of the complexes gives them some important properties:

===Colour===
Metal complexes often have spectacular colors caused by electronic transitions by the absorption of light. For this reason they are often applied as [[Pigment#Physical_basis|pigments]]. Most transitions that are related to colored metal complexes are either '''d-d transitions''' or '''charge transfer bands'''.  In a d-d transition, an electron in a d orbital on the metal is excited by a photon to another d orbital of higher energy.  A charge transfer band entails promotion of an electron from a metal-based orbital into an empty ligand-based orbital ([[Charge transfer complex|Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer]] or MLCT).  The converse also occurs: excitation of an electron in a ligand-based orbital into an empty metal-based orbital ([[Charge transfer complex|Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer]] or LMCT).  These phenomena can be observed with the aid of electronic spectroscopy; also known as [[UV-Vis]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, D., Bertolucci, M., ''Symmetry and Spectroscopy''. 1989 New York, Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt; For simple compounds with high symmetry, the d-d transitions can be assigned using [[Tanabe-Sugano diagram]]s.  Increasingly, these assignments can be supported with [[computational chemistry]].

===Magnetism===
{{main|magnetochemistry}}
Metal complexes that have unpaired electrons are [[magnetic]]. Considering only monometallic complexes, unpaired electrons arise because the complex has an odd number of electrons or because electron pairing is destabilized.  Thus, monomeric Ti(III) species have one &quot;d-electron&quot; and must be [[paramagnetism|(para)magnetic]], regardless of the geometry or the nature of the ligands.  Ti(II), with two d-electrons, forms some complexes that have two unpaired electrons and others with none. This effect is illustrated by the compounds TiX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: when X = Cl, the complex is paramagnetic ([[high spin]] configuration) whereas when X=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, it is diamagnetic ([[low spin]] configuration). It is important to realize that ligands provide an important means of adjusting the ground state properties. 

In bi- and polymetallic complexes, in which the individual centers have an odd number of electrons or which are high spin, the situation is more complicated.  If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or more) metal centers, the electrons may couple ([[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic coupling]], resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other ([[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic coupling]]).  When there is no interaction, the two (or more) individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules.

===Reactivity===
Complexes show a variety of possible reactivities:

*Electron transfers
*:A common reaction between coordination complexes involving ligands are [[Inner sphere electron transfer|inner]] and [[outer sphere electron transfer]]s. They are two different mechanisms of [[electron transfer]] [[redox]] reactions, largely defined by the late [[Henry Taube]]. In an inner sphere reaction, a ligand with two [[lone electron pair]]s acts as a ''[[bridging ligand]]'', a ligand to which both coordination centres can bond. Through this, electrons are transferred from one centre to another.
*(Degenerate) [[ligand exchange]]
*:One important indicator of reactivity is the rate of degenerate exchange of ligands.  For example, the rate of interchange of coordinate water in [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes varies over 20 orders of magnitude.  Complexes where the ligands are released and rebound rapidly are classified as labile.  Such labile complexes can be quite stable thermodynamically.  Typical labile metal complexes have either low charge (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), electrons in d-orbitals that are antibonding with respect to the ligands (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), or lack covalency (Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, where Ln is any lanthanide).  The lability of a metal complex also depends on the high vs. low spin configurations when such is possible.  Thus high spin Fe(II) and Co(III) form labile complexes whereas low spin analogues are inert.  Cr(III) can only exist in the low-spin state (quartet), which is inert because of its high formal oxidation state, absence of electrons in orbitals that are M-L antibonding, plus some &quot;ligand field stabilization&quot; associated with the d3 configuration.
* Associative processes
*:Complexes that have unfilled or half-filled orbitals often show the capability to react with substrates.  Most substrates have a singlet ground-state; that is, they have lone electron pairs (e.g. water, amines, ethers), so these substrates need an empty orbital to be able to react with a metal centre.  Some substrates (e.g. molecular [[oxygen]]) have a triplet ground state, which results that metals with half-filled orbitals have a tendency to react with such substrates (it must be said that the dioxygen-molecule also has lone pairs, so it is also capable to react as a 'normal' Lewis base).

If the ligands around the metal are carefully chosen, the metal can aid in ([[stoichiometric]] or [[catalytic]]) transformations of molecules or be used as a sensor.

==Classification==
Metal complexes, also known as coordination compounds, include all metal compounds, aside from metal vapors, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, and [[alloy]]s.  The study of &quot;coordination chemistry&quot; is the study of &quot;inorganic chemistry&quot; of all [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s, [[transition metal]]s, [[lanthanide]]s, [[actinides]], and [[metalloid]]s. Thus, coordination chemistry is the chemistry of the majority of the periodic table.  Metals and metal ions only exist, in the condensed phases at least, surrounded by ligands.

The areas of coordination chemistry can be classified according to the nature of the ligands, broadly speaking:
*Classical (or &quot;[[Alfred Werner|Werner]] Complexes&quot;): Ligands in classical coordination chemistry bind to metals, almost exclusively, via their &quot;[[lone pair]]s&quot; of electrons residing on the main group atoms of the ligand. Typical ligands are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Cyanide|CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[ethylenediamine|en&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]
:Examples: [Co([[EDTA]])]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Cobalt(III) hexammine chloride|[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Potassium ferrioxalate|[Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
*Organometallic Chemistry:  Ligands are organic (alkenes, alkynes, alkyls) as well as &quot;organic-like&quot; ligands such as phosphines, hydride, and CO.
:Example: [[Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer|(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
*Bioinorganic Chemistry: Ligands are those provided by nature, especially including the side chains of amino acids, and many [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s such as [[porphyrin]]s.
:Example: [[hemoglobin]]
:Many natural ligands are &quot;classical&quot;  especially including water.
*Cluster Chemistry: Ligands are all of the above  also include other metals as ligands.
: Example Ru&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;

*In some cases there are combinations of different fields:
:Example: [[Iron-sulfur protein|[Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Scysteinyl)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]], in which a cluster is embedded in a biologically active species.

[[Mineralogy]], [[materials science]], and [[solid state chemistry]] - as they apply to metal ions - are subsets of coordination chemistry in the sense that the metals are surrounded by ligands.  In many cases these ligands are oxides or sulfides, but the metals are coordinated nonetheless, and the principles and guidelines discussed below apply. In [[water of crystallization|hydrate]]s, at least some of the ligands are water molecules. It is true that the focus of mineralogy, materials science, and solid state chemistry differs from the usual focus of coordination or inorganic chemistry. The former are primarily concerned with polymeric structures, properties arising from a collective effects of many highly interconnected metals. In contrast, coordination chemistry focuses on reactivity and properties of complexes containing individual metal atoms or small ensembles of metal atoms.

===Older classifications of isomerism===
Traditional classifications of the kinds of isomer have become archaic with the advent of modern structural chemistry.  In the older literature, one encounters:

*[[Ionisation isomerism]]  describes the possible isomers arising from the exchange between the outer sphere and inner sphere.  This classification relies on an archaic classification of the inner and outer sphere.  In this classification, the &quot;outer sphere ligands,&quot; when ions in solution, may be switched with &quot;inner sphere ligands&quot; to produce an isomer.
*[[Solvation isomerism]] occurs when an inner sphere ligand is replaced by a [[solvent]] molecule.  This classification is obsolete because it considers solvents as being distinct from other ligands.  Some of the problems are discussed under [[water of crystallization]].

==Naming complexes==
The basic procedure for naming a complex:
# When naming a complex ion, the ligands are named before the metal ion.
# Write the names of the ligands in alphabetical order. (Numerical prefixes do not affect the order.)
#* Multiple occurring monodentate ligands receive a prefix according to the number of occurrences: ''di-'', ''tri-'', ''tetra-'', ''penta-'', or ''hexa''.  Polydentate ligands (e.g., ethylenediamine, oxalate) receive ''bis-'', ''tris-'', ''tetrakis-'', etc.
#* Anions end in ''ido''.  This replaces the final 'e' when the anion ends with '-ate', e.g. ''sulfate'' becomes ''sulfato''. It replaces 'ide': ''cyanide'' becomes ''cyanido''.
#* Neutral ligands are given their usual name, with some exceptions: NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; becomes ''[[ammine]]''; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O becomes ''aqua'' or ''aquo''; CO becomes ''carbonyl''; NO becomes ''nitrosyl''.
# Write the name of the central atom/ion.  If the complex is an anion, the central atom's name will end in ''-ate'', and its Latin name will be used if available (except for mercury).
# If the central atom's oxidation state needs to be specified (when it is one of several possible, or zero), write it as a Roman numeral (or 0) in parentheses.
# Name cation then anion as separate words (if applicable, as in last example)

Examples:
: [NiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → tetrachloridonickelate(II) ion
: [CuNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; → amminepentachloridocuprate(II) ion
: [Cd(en)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] → dicyanidobis(ethylenediamine)cadmium(II)
: [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate

The coordination number of ligands attached to more than one metal (bridging ligands) is indicated by a subscript to the Greek symbol μ placed before the ligand name. Thus the [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] of [[aluminium trichloride]] is described by Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Application of coordination compounds==
# They are used in photography, i.e., AgBr forms soluble complex with [[sodium thiosulfate]] in photography.
# K[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is used for [[electroplating]] of silver, and K[Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]is used for [[gold plating]].
# Some ligands [[oxidation|oxidise]] Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion.
# [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA) is used for estimation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;in [[hard water]].
# Silver and gold are extracted by treating zinc with their cyanide complexes.

==History==
Coleco originally manufactured shoe leather, which later led to a business in [[leather crafting|leather craft kits]] in the 1950s. They began manufacturing plastic moulding and moved into plastic wading pools in the 1960s. The leather part of the business was then sold off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COLECO MOVES OUT OF THE CABBAGE PATCH|work= The New York Times|date=1985-07-21|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/21/business/coleco-moves-out-of-the-cabbage-patch.html?&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=N. R. | last=Kleinfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under CEO [[Arnold Greenberg]], the company entered the [[video game console]] business with the [[Coleco Telstar|Telstar]] in 1976. Dozens of companies were introducing game systems that year after [[Atari]]'s successful [[Pong]] console. Nearly all of these new games were based on [[General Instrument]]'s &quot;Pong-on-a-chip&quot;. However, General Instrument had underestimated demand, and there were severe shortages. Coleco had been one of the first to place an order, and was one of the few companies to receive an order in full. Though dedicated game consoles did not last long on the market, their early order enabled Coleco to [[break-even|break even]].

Coleco continued to do well in electronics. They transitioned next into [[handheld electronic game]]s, a market popularized by [[Mattel]]. Coleco produced two very popular lines of games, the &quot;head to head&quot; series of two player sports games, (Football, Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Hockey) and the mini-arcade series of licensed video arcade titles such as [[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]] and [[Ms. Pacman]]. A third line of educational handhelds was also produced and included the Electronic Learning Machine, Lil Genius, Digits, and a trivia game called QuizWhiz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Coleco-vision-console.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ColecoVision video game console]]
Coleco returned to the video game console market in 1982 with the launch of the [[ColecoVision]]. While the system was quite popular, Coleco hedged their bet on video games by introducing a line of [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]]. They also introduced the [[Coleco Gemini]], a clone of the popular Atari 2600.

When the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game business began to implode in 1983]], it seemed clear that video game consoles were being supplanted by [[home computer]]s. Coleco's strategy was to introduce the [[Coleco Adam]] home computer, both as a stand-alone system and as an expansion module to the ColecoVision. This effort failed, in large part because Adams were often unreliable. The Adam flopped; Coleco withdrew from electronics early in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Coleco Discontinues Its Adam Computer Line |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1985-01-03|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-03/business/fi-11281_1|accessdate=2010-08-26 | first=Donald | last=Woutat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1983, Coleco released the [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] series of dolls which were wildly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=213040&amp;c=10|title=Cleveland's Cabbage Patch Kids turn 25|date=AccessNorthGA.com|publisher=2008-09-07|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, they introduced an ALF plush based on the furry alien character who had [[ALF (TV series)|his own television series]] at the time, as well as a talking version and a cassette-playing &quot;Storytelling ALF&quot; doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Coleco Plays The Odds, Pays For Ads For 'Alf' |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-08-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-26/entertainment/ca-17809_1_alf-products|accessdate=2010-08-26 | first=Morgan | last=Gendel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staggering success of the dolls could not stem the tide of red ink that had begun with the launch of the Adam computer.

In 2005, River West Brands, a [[Chicago]]-based [[brand]] revitalization company, re-introduced Coleco to the marketplace. In late 2006, they introduced the [[Coleco Sonic]], a handheld system containing twenty [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Game Gear]] games.

The '''ColecoVision''' is [[Coleco|Coleco Industries]]' [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second generation]] home [[video game console]] which was released in August 1982. The ColecoVision offered [[arcade game|arcade-quality]] graphics and gaming style, and the means to expand the system's basic hardware. Released with a catalog of 12 [[launch title]]s, with an additional ten games announced for 1982, approximately 145 titles in total were published as [[ROM cartridge]]s for the system between 1982 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Forster |first=Winnie |authorlink=Winnie Forster |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972 - 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; River West Brands currently owns the ColecoVision brand name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverwestbrands.com/news/RiverWest_Underalls_Announcement.pdf |title=Press release for River West Brands |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[IGN]] named the ColecoVision their 12th best video game console out of their list of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/12.html |title=Colecovision is number 12 |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Coleco licensed [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' as the official pack-in cartridge for all ColecoVision consoles, and this version of the game was well received as a near-perfect arcade [[porting|port]], helping to boost the console's popularity. By Christmas of 1982, Coleco had sold more than 500,000 units,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=Business Week | title=Coleco hits with home video games | page=31 | date=1983-01-24 | quote=Most of 1982's action was in the second half, when Coleco shipped 550,000 ColecoVision game machines--which sell for $169 to $189--booking orders for nearly that many more.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher=Associated Press | title=Video Game Maker Says 1st-Quarter Profit More Than Tripled | date=1983-04-20 | quote=Arnold C. Greenberg, Coleco's president and chief executive, said more than 500,000 ColecoVision players were shipped during the first quarter, nearly equaling the number shipped in all of 1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part on the strength of its bundled game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=New York Times | title=Coleco's New Video Challenge | page=1 (Section D) | date=1982-11-11 | quote=Potential Colecovision buyers have also apparently been attracted by Coleco's licensing agreement with Nintendo Inc., the Japanese creator of Donkey Kong, a current arcade hit, and Universal City Studios Inc. One Donkey Kong cartridge comes with each Colecovision unit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ColecoVision's main competitor was the arguably more advanced but less commercially successful [[Atari 5200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=Christian Science Monitor | title=Zap! Pow! Video games sparkle in holiday market | last=Aeppel | first=Timothy | page=7 | date=1982-12-10 | quote=In recent weeks, two particularly hot-selling systems have emerged - the Atari 5200 and ColecoVision. Both are described as powerful 'third wave' machines, the Cadillacs of game systems, and priced accordingly at close to $200...[T]hey are sure to snatch most of the Christmas market.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=New York Times | title=Sigh of Relief on Video Games | last=Harmetz | first=Aljean | page=1 (Section D) | date=1984-01-10 | quote=As for game hardware, many experts said that Atari's...5200 or Coleco's Colecovision would corner the high end.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=New York Times | title=Coleco Strong In Marketing | date=1983-08-01 | quote=Since its introduction last fall, Colecovision has sold about 1.4 million units...Of that total, about 900,000 were sold this year, compared with 800,000 units by Atari and 300,000 by Mattel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ColecoVision was distributed by [[CBS Electronics]] outside of the [[United States]], and was branded the '''CBS ColecoVision'''.

Sales quickly passed one million in early 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Video Game Maker Says 1st-Quarter Profit More Than Tripled, 1983-04-20&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[video game crash of 1983]]. By the beginning of 1984, quarterly sales of the ColecoVision had dramatically decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher=PR Newswire | title=[Coleco Industries sales report] | date=1984-04-17 | quote='First quarter sales of ColecoVision were substantial, although much less {{sic|?|that}} those for the year ago quarter,' Greenberg said in a prepared statement. He said the company has sold 2 million ColecoVision games since its introduction in 1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 18 months, the Coleco company ramped down its video game division, ultimately withdrawing from the video game market by the end of the summer of 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=New York Times | publisher=Reuters | title=Coleco Reassesses Its Video Games | page=4 (Section D) | date=1985-06-13 | quote=Coleco Industries is assessing its continuing commitment to the video game business...Arnold C.

The company's chairman, Arnold Greenberg, said Coleco expects no more charges against earnings from the two discontinued products.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total sales of the ColecoVision are uncertain but were ultimately in excess of 2 million units, as sales had reached that number by the spring of 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Coleco Industries sales report, 1984-04-17&lt;/ref&gt; while the console continued to sell modestly up until its discontinuation the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=New York Times | last=Kleinfield | first=N. R. | title=Coleco Moves Out Of The Cabbage Patch | page=4 (Section 3) | date=1985-07-21 | quote=Coleco is now debating whether to withdraw from electronics altogether. Colecovision still sells, but it is a shadow of its former self.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[Bit Corporation]] produced a ColecoVision clone called the [[Dina (video game console)|Dina]], which was sold in the United States by Telegames as the [[Telegames Personal Arcade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&amp;id=24 |title=ColecoVision - 1982-1984 - Classic Gaming |publisher=Classicgaming.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==

The main console unit consists of a 14×8×2&amp;nbsp;inch rectangular plastic case that houses the motherboard, with a cartridge slot on the right side and connectors for the external [[power supply]] and [[RF connector|RF jack]] at the rear. The [[game controller|controller]]s connect into plugs in a recessed area on the top of the unit.

The design of the controllers is similar to that of [[Mattel]]'s [[Intellivision]]—the controller is rectangular and consists of a numeric keypad and a set of side buttons. In place of the circular control disc below the keypad, the Coleco controller has a short, 1.5-inch [[joystick]]. The keypad is designed to accept a thin plastic overlay that maps the keys for a particular game. Each ColecoVision console shipped with two controllers.

All first-party cartridges and most third-party software titles feature a 12-second pause before presenting the game select screen. This delay results from an intentional loop in the console's [[BIOS]] to enable on-screen display of the ColecoVision brand. Companies like [[Parker Brothers]], [[Activision]], and [[Micro Fun]] bypassed this loop, which necessitated embedding portions of the BIOS outside the delay loop, further reducing storage available to actual game programming.

=== Expansion modules ===

[[Image:Coleco expansion2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Expansion Module #2]]
[[Image:Super Action Controller Coleco DSCF0353.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Super Action Controller]]
From its introduction, Coleco had touted a hardware add-on called the '''Expansion Module #1''' which made the ColecoVision compatible with the industry-leading [[Atari 2600]]. Functionally, this gave the ColecoVision the largest software library of any console of its day. The expansion module prompted legal action from Atari, but Atari was unable to stop sales of the module because the 2600 could be reproduced with standard parts. Coleco was also able to design and market the [[Coleco Gemini|Gemini game system]] which was an exact clone of the 2600, but with combined joystick/paddle controllers.

'''Expansion Module #2''' is a driving controller expansion that consists of a [[steering wheel]], gas pedal and the pack-in game ''Turbo''. The driving controller is also compatible with the games ''Destructor'' and ''Dukes Of Hazzard''.

'''Expansion Module #3''', the final hardware expansion module, was released in the summer of 1983. Module #3 converts the ColecoVision into a full-fledged computer known as the [[Coleco Adam]], complete with keyboard and digital data pack (DDP) cassette drives. Module #3 was originally conceived to be the ColecoVision '''Super Game Module''' using ''game wafers'' as the storage medium. Although Coleco presented a mock-up of the SGM at the 1983 New York Toy Show, that product was never manufactured. There were also rumors that Expansion Module #3 was to have incorporated an [[RCA]] [[Selectavision|CED]] player to store larger amounts of data.

Coleco prototyped a fourth expansion module intended to provide compatibility with Mattel's Intellivision, but this was never released.

Two controller expansions were also available. First was the '''Roller Controller''', a trackball packaged with a port of the arcade game ''[[Slither (video game)|Slither]]'', a ''[[Centipede (arcade game)|Centipede]]'' clone and meant to be used with some dedicated games like [[Victory (game)|Victory]] or to enhance the gameplay of previously published cartridges which benefitted from its trackball system (like [[Wargames (game)|Wargames]]). The second was the '''Super Action Controller Set''', resembling a pair of boxing gloves each with joystick and numeric keypad on top and a series of buttons along the grip. It came with the game ''Super Action Baseball'' and saw later release of the ''[[Rocky]]''-inspired ''Super Action Boxing'' and a port of ''[[Front Line (arcade game)|Front Line]]''.

=== Similarities to other platforms ===

The ColecoVision contains the same CPU and graphics chip as the [[MSX]] and [[Sega SG-1000]]/[[SC-3000]] but the MSX contains a different sound chip, the [[General Instruments AY-3-8912|AY-3-8910]]. ColecoVision has the same CPU and a sound chip with [[Sega Master System]], also similar but worse graphics chip. For this reason it is not hard to port games between these systems.

== Games ==
{{See also|List of ColecoVision games}}
Coleco's software approach was to license arcade games that Atari had not. Realizing that Atari had firm support from [[Namco]] (the creators of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and many other hits), Coleco entered into contracts with companies such as [[Sega]], [[Konami]], and [[Universal (game company)|Universal]]. Given that the ColecoVision could produce near arcade-quality ports, industry magazines like ''[[Electronic Games]]'' were unanimous in their enthusiasm over the console.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Some of the more popular games include ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (the pack-in), ''[[Donkey Kong Junior (video game)|Donkey Kong Junior]]'', ''[[Carnival (game)|Carnival]]'', ''[[Lady Bug (arcade game)|Lady Bug]]'', ''[[Mouse Trap (arcade game)|Mouse Trap]]'', and ''[[Zaxxon]]''. Coleco also popularized lesser known arcade games, such as ''[[Venture (arcade game)|Venture]]'', ''[[Cosmic Avenger]]'', and ''[[Mr. Do!]]''. In some cases, the console versions were arguably superior to the arcade versions, as seen in ''[[Space Panic]]''. Later Coleco continued adapting newer successful arcade games like [[Subroc]], [[Time Pilot]] and [[Frenzy (video game)|Frenzy]], the company also made inferior ports of many of these games for the Atari 2600 and [[Intellivision]], in an effort to broaden its market{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

Compared to arcade ports, the ColecoVision did not offer many games original to the console, though a few notable releases are ''[[Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle]]'', ''[[War Room (video game)|War Room]]'', ''[[Illusions (video game)|Illusions]]'', and ''[[Fortune Builder]]'', an early milestone in the style of ''[[SimCity]]''.

Coleco was infamous for its [[vaporware]] offerings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} An example of such was to be an adaptation of ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]''. It is not known whether the game's printed screen shots were from an actual prototype or were merely pre-development illustrations. The ColecoVision's box itself bears several other examples, among them ''Chess Challenger'', ''Side Trak'', ''Rip Cord'', ''Horse Racing'', and ''Mr. Turtle''.

== Legacy ==

In 1996, programmer Kevin Horton released the first [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] game for the ColecoVision, a [[Tetris]] clone entitled ''Kevtris''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kevtris&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/colecovision/kevtris |title=Kevtris for ColecoVision - MobyGames |publisher=MobyGames&lt;! |date=2006-11-29 |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kevinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_horton.html |title=Classic Videogame Games INTERVIEW - Kevin Horton |publisher=Good Deal Games |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Telegames released ''Personal Arcade Vol. 1'', a collection of ColecoVision games for [[Microsoft Windows]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pav1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/personal-arcade-volume-one |title=Personal Arcade Volume One for Windows - MobyGames |publisher=MobyGames&lt;! |date=2000-05-21 |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1998 follow-up, ''Colecovision Hits Volume One''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cvh1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/classic-gamer-colecovision-hits-volume-one |title=Classic Gamer: Colecovision Hits Volume One for Windows - MobyGames |publisher=MobyGames&lt;! |date=2000-05-30 |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The value of the ColecoVision as an 1980s pop culture icon was discussed on VH1's ''I Love The 80's Strikes Back''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ilove80s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/i_love_the_80s_strikes_back/series.jhtml |title=I Love the 80s Strikes Back &amp;#124; Show Cast, Episodes, Guides, Trailers, Web Exclusives, Previews &amp;#124; VH1.com |publisher=VH1.com&lt;! |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several television series have aired episodes that reference or parody the console: ''[[South Park]]'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chickenpox&quot;, Season 2 Episode 23, Production no. 210&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Family Guy]]''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I Take Thee Quaqmire&quot;, Season 4 Episode 21, Production no. 4ACX23&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=~Will Harris |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2005/everybody_hates_chris_1.htm |title=Everybody Hates Chris: Season One review, Everybody Hates Chris: Season 1 DVD review |publisher=Bullz-eye.com |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Telstar''' is a series of [[video game console]]s produced by [[Coleco]] from 1976 to 1978. Starting with Telstar ''[[Pong]]'' clone based on [[General Instrument]]'s [[AY-3-8500]] chip in 1976, there were 14 consoles released in the Telstar branded series.

== Models ==
#'''Telstar''' - (model 6040, 1976) Three ''Pong'' variants ([[ice hockey|hockey]], [[American handball|handball]], [[tennis]]), two [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] controllers fixed on console.

#'''Telstar Regent''' - (model 6036, 1977) Same as the Telstar Colormatic but no color and black and white case.
#'''Telstar Sportsman''' - (1978) Similar to Telstar Regent, but with an additional light gun and different setting switches.  &lt;!--The sportsman has 4 games built in and no color. (unverified)--&gt;
#'''Telstar Combat!''' - (model 6065, 1977) Four variations on [[Kee Games]]' ''[[Tank (arcade game)|Tank]]'', four fixed joysticks (two per player), uses a [[General Instruments]] [[AY-3-8700]] Tank chip.
#'''Telstar Colortron''' - (model 6135, 1978) Four ''Pong'' variants, in color, built in sound, fixed paddles, uses [[AY-3-8510]] chip.
#'''[[Coleco Telstar Marksman|Telstar Marksman]]''' - (model 6136, 1978) Four ''Pong'' variants and two gun games in color, larger light gun with removable stock, fixed paddles, uses [[AY-3-8512]] chip.
#'''Telstar Galaxy''' - Separate [[joystick]]s and fixed paddles, uses [[AY-3-8600]] game chip and [[AY-3-8615]] color encoder.

#'''Telstar Arcade''' - Cartridge-based, triangular case includes light gun, steering wheel with gear shift, and paddles, one on each side. Each cartridge includes a customized [[MOS Technology]] [[MPS-7600]] chip (one of these chips was the 004 used by the Gemini). The chip contained custom logic circuits driven by a basic processor which ran a very small program stored in [[Read Only Memory|ROM]].

The large product lineup and the impending fading out of the ''Pong'' machines led Coleco to face near-bankruptcy in 1980{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{history of war}}
'''Conventional warfare''' is a form of [[war]]fare conducted by
using conventional military weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more [[sovereign state|state]]s in open confrontation. The forces on each side are well-defined, and fight using weapons that primarily target the opposing army. It is normally fought using [[conventional weapon]]s, not [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], nor [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] weapons.

The general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent's military force, thereby negating its ability to engage in conventional warfare. In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to [[unconventional warfare]] tactics.

==History==
===Formation of the state===
{{details|Sovereign state#Formation of the state}}
The state was first advocated by [[Plato]], then found more acceptance in the consolidation of power under the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. European monarchs then gained power as the Catholic Church was stripped of temporal power and was replaced by the [[divine right of kings]]. In 1648, the powers of [[Europe]] signed the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] which ended the religious violence for purely political governance and outlook, signifying the birth of the modern 'state'.

Within this statist paradigm, only the state and its appointed representatives were allowed to bear [[weapon|arms]] and enter into war. In fact, war was only understood as a conflict between sovereign states. [[Monarch|King]]s strengthened this idea and gave it the force of [[law]]. Whereas previously any [[nobility|noble]] could start a war, the monarchs of Europe of necessity consolidated military power in response to the [[Napoleonic war]].

===The Clausewitzian paradigm===
{{details|Carl von Clausewitz}}
[[Prussia]] was one country attempting to amass military power. Carl von Clausewitz, one of Prussia's officers, wrote ''[[On War]]'', a work rooted solely in the world of the state. All other forms of intrastate conflict, such as [[rebellion]], are not accounted for because, in theoretical terms, Clausewitz could not account for warfare before the state (However, near the end of his life, Clausewitz grew increasingly aware of the importance of non-state military actors. This is revealed in his conceptions of &quot;the people in arms&quot; which he noted arose from the same social and political sources as traditional inter-state warfare&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;Smith, M.L.R. &quot;Guerrillas in the mist: reassessing strategy and low intensity warfare&quot;. ''Review of International Studies''. Vol. 29, 19–37. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;).

Practices such as [[raiding]] or [[feud|blood feuds]] were then labeled criminal activities and stripped of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. This war paradigm reflected the view of most of the modernized world at the beginning of the 21st century, as verified by examination of the conventional armies of the time: large, high maintenance, technologically advanced armies designed to compete against similarly designed forces.

Clausewitz also forwarded the issue of [[casus belli]]. While previous wars were fought for social, religious, even cultural reasons, Clausewitz taught that war is merely &quot;a continuation of politics by other means.&quot; It is a rational calculation where states fight for their interests (whether they are economic, security related, or otherwise) once normal discourse has broken down.

==Prevalence==
The majority of modern wars have been conducted using the means of conventional warfare. Confirmed use of biological warfare by a nation state has not occurred since 1945, and chemical warfare has been used only a few times (notably in the [[Iran-Iraq War]]). [[nuclear weapon|Nuclear warfare]] has only occurred once with the [[United States]] [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing]] the [[Japan]]ese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in August 1945.

==Decline==
{{See also|Nuclear peace}}
The state and Clausewitzian principles peaked in the [[World War]]s of the 20th century, but also laid the groundwork for their dilapidation due to [[nuclear proliferation]] and the manifestation of culturally aligned conflict. The nuclear bomb was the result of the state perfecting its quest to overthrow its competitive duplicates. Ironically, this development seems to have pushed conventional conflict waged by the state to the sidelines. Were two conventional armies to fight, the loser would have redress in its nuclear arsenal.

Thus, no two [[nuclear powers]] have yet fought a conventional war [[proxy war|directly]], with the exception of brief skirmishes between for example, China and Russia in the 1969 [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1969)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] and between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in the 1999 [[Kargil War]].

==Replacement==
Conventional warfare, waged by the state, has become something not worthy of a declaration of war. Instead, those capable of fighting underneath the nuclear umbrella (supranational [[terrorism|terrorists]], corporate [[mercenaries]], ethnic [[militia]]s, and so on.) have now come to dominate the majority of conflict in the [[post-modern]] era. These conflicts cannot be explained under the statist system.

[[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has posited that the world in the early 21st century exists as a system of nine distinct &quot;civilizations,&quot; instead of many [[sovereign state]]s. These civilizations are delineated along cultural lines, for example, Western, [[Islam]]ic, Sinic, [[Hindu]] and so on. In this way, cultures that have long been dominated by the West are reasserting themselves and looking to challenge the status quo. Thus, [[culture]] has replaced the state as the locus of war. This kind of civilizational war, in our time as in times long past, occurs where these cultures buffet up against one another. Some high-profile examples are the Pakistan/India conflict or the battles in the Sudan. This sort of war has defined the field since World War II.

These cultural forces will not contend with state-based armies in the traditional way. When faced with battalions of tanks, jets, and missiles, the cultural opponent dissolves away into the population. They benefit from the territorially constrained states, being able to move freely from one country to the next, while states must negotiate with other sovereign states. The state's spy networks are also severely limited by cultural factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chauvinism''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ʃ|oʊ|v|ɨ|n|ɪ|z|əm}}), in its original and primary meaning, is an exaggerated, bellicose [[patriotism]] and a belief in national superiority and glory.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; By extension it has come to include an extreme and unreasoning [[Partisan (political)|partisan]]ship on behalf of any group to which one belongs, especially when the partisanship includes malice and hatred towards rival groups. [[Jingoism]] is the British parallel form of this French word, when referring to nation.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; A contemporary use of the term in English is in the phrase ''male chauvinism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English |url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/24/1224.html |accessdate=2008-12-04 |quote=''Chauvinism'' is &quot;fanatical, boastful, unreasoning patriotism&quot; and by extension &quot;prejudiced belief or unreasoning pride in any group to which you belong.&quot; Lately, though, the compounds ''male chauvinism'' and ''male chauvinist'' have gained so much popularity that some ill informed users may no longer recall the patriotic and other more generalized meanings of the words.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because &quot;chauvinism&quot; is most often heard in this context, it is often mistakenly believed to refer exclusively to &quot;male chauvinism&quot; such as [[anti-feminism]] and [[sexism]].  It is an [[eponym]] of a possibly fictional French soldier [[Nicolas Chauvin]] who was credited with many superhuman feats in the late 18th century.

== Chauvinism as nationalism ==
{{See also|The White Man's Burden}}
In &quot;Imperialism, Nationalism, Chauvinism&quot;, in ''The Review of Politics'' '''7'''.4, (October 1945), p.&amp;nbsp;457, [[Hannah Arendt]], the political theorist, describes the concept:

{{quote|Chauvinism is an almost natural product of the national concept in so far as it springs directly from the old idea of the &quot;national mission.&quot; ... [A] nation's mission might be interpreted precisely as bringing its light to other, less fortunate peoples that, for whatever reason, have miraculously been left by history without a national mission. As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.}}

==Chauvinism as sexism==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
{{see also|Sexism|Masculism|Feminism}}
''Male chauvinism'' is a term used to describe the belief that [[men]] are superior to [[women]].  It is often used interchangeably with &quot;sexism&quot; and is closely associated with [[misogyny]] and perceptions of women as inferior to men, especially [[intellect]]ually.  The unqualified term &quot;chauvinism&quot; is far more likely to refer to a male chauvinism than female chauvinism in the context of chauvinism as sexism.

An oft cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism, attempts to find the underlying causes of &quot;male chauvinism.&quot;

:Male chauvinism was studied in the [[psychoanalytic]] therapy of 11 men. It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, [[oedipal]] anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine [[self-esteem]]. [[Mother]]s were more important than fathers in the development of chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with [[decompensation]] in wives.&lt;ref&gt;''Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism'', [[Sherwyn M. Woods]], 1976, http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/63&lt;/ref&gt;


''Female chauvinism'' is a less commonly used term used to describe the symmetrical attitude that [[women]] are superior to [[men]]. The term ''female chauvinism'' has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of feminism; leading second-wave feminist [[Betty Friedan]] being a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;If I were a man, I would strenuously object to the assumption that women have any moral or spiritual superiority as a class. This is [...] female chauvinism.&quot; Friedan, Betty. 1998. ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement''. Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariel Levy]] used the term in similar, but opposite sense in her book, ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]],''  in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older [[Misogyny|misogynist]] [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture'', [[Ariel Levy]], 2006, ISBN 0743284283&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hypothetical types of biochemistry''' are forms of [[biochemistry]] speculated to be scientifically viable but not proven to exist at this time. While the kinds of [[life on earth|living beings we know on earth]] commonly use [[carbon]] for basic structural and [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions, [[water]] as a [[solvent]] and [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] to define and control their form, it is possible that undiscovered life-forms could exist that differ radically in their basic structures and biochemistry from that known to science.&lt;ref&gt;Rampelotto, P. H. (2010). The Search for Life on Other Planets: Sulfur-Based, Silicon-Based, Ammonia-Based Life. In: Russell, M. (Org.). Abiogenesis, Origins and the Search for Life. Cosmology Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]] being based on these &quot;alternative&quot; biochemistries is a common subject in [[science fiction]], but is also discussed in a non-fiction scientific context. For example, a committee set up by the [[United States National Research Council]] published a 116-page report in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which explores &quot;hypothetical alternative chemistries of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=R10 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative-chirality biomolecules==
Perhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing [[Left-handed protein|chirality]] of its biomolecules. In known Earth-based life, [[amino acid]]s are almost universally of the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form and [[sugar]]s are of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; form. Molecules of opposite chirality have identical chemical properties to their mirrored forms, so life that used &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; amino acids or &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; sugars may be possible; molecules of such a chirality, however, would be incompatible with organisms using the opposing chirality molecules. It is questionable, however, whether such a biochemistry would be truly alien; while it is certainly an alternative [[stereochemistry]], molecules that are overwhelmingly found in one [[enantiomer]] throughout the vast majority of organisms can nonetheless often be found in another enantiomer in different (often [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]) organisms such as in comparisons between members of [[Archea]] and other [[Domain (biology)|domains]], making it an open topic whether an alternative [[stereochemistry]] is truly novel.

==Non-carbon-based biochemistries==
Scientists have speculated about the pros and cons of using [[atom]]s other than [[carbon]] to form the molecular structures necessary for life, but no one has proposed a theory employing such atoms to form all the molecular machinery necessary for life. Still, since [[human]]s are carbon-based beings and have never encountered life outside the earth’s environment, excluding the possibility of ''all other elements'' may be considered [[carbon chauvinism]].

=== Silicon biochemistry ===
The most commonly proposed basis for an alternative biochemical system is the [[silicon]] atom, since silicon has many [[chemical property|chemical properties]] similar to carbon and is in the same [[periodic table group]], the [[carbon group]]. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | title = The universal nature of biochemistry. | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 805–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11158550 | pmc = 33372 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, silicon has several drawbacks as a carbon alternative. Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms, which permits the chemical versatility necessary for [[metabolism]]. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic,&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Ed. [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/12/02/mono-lake-bacteria-build-their-dna-using-arsenic-and-no-this-isnt-about-aliens/], &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;, December 2, 2010, accessed December 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;/&gt; Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as &quot;monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;/&gt; This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double or triple [[covalent bond]]s, which are important for a biochemical system.

[[Silane]]s, which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;world-building&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first=Stephen| last=Gillette| title=World-Building| publisher=Writer's Digest Books| isbn=0812242475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex long-chain silicone molecules are still less stable than their carbon counterparts, though.

Another obstacle is that [[silicon dioxide]] (a common ingredient of many sands), the analog of [[carbon dioxide]], is a non-[[soluble]] solid at the temperature range where water is liquid, making it difficult for silicon to be introduced into water-based biochemical systems even if the necessary range of biochemical molecules could be constructed out of it. Another problem with silicon dioxide is that it would be the product of aerobic respiration. If a silicon-based life form were to breathe using oxygen, as life on Earth does, it would possibly produce [[silicon dioxide]] as a [[by-product]] of this, assuming that the only difference between the two types of life is silicon in place of carbon. This implies that the exhaled product, [[silicon dioxide]], would be a solid, thus filling the respiratory organs of the organism with sand. This however would be solved if the organism lives in temperatures of several hundred to thousand degrees, where the [[silicon dioxide]] becomes a liquid. Oxygen-breathing silicon life, if it exists, is therefore most likely to exist in environments with very high temperatures or pressure.

Finally, of the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon while only 8 are based on silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html| title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon? Why couldn't organisms be based on other substances?| work=[sci.astro] ET Life (Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions)| accessdate=2006-07-21| first=Joseph| last=Lazio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, of those 8 compounds, four also include carbon within them. The cosmic abundance of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation upon which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets.

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in the Earth's crust is roughly 925:1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/properties/text/image-flash/abund-crust.html
 | title = Abundance in Earth's Crust
 | publisher = WebElements.com
 | accessdate = 2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon, though rare, has proven to be much more successful as a life base than the much more abundant silicon, may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. For example: silicon does not possess the extensive versatility that the carbon to form compounds, the compounds formed by silicon are unstable and it blocks the flow of heat.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the silicate skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s. This suggests that extraterrestrial life forms may have silicon-based structure molecules and carbon-based proteins for metabolic purposes, therefore enabling the ability to feed on a common resource on a terrestrial planet like Earth for building up the silicon-based part of their body.

Silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures different from the surface of a terrestrial planet, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon.

[[Graham Cairns-Smith|A. G. Cairns-Smith]] has proposed that the first living organisms to exist on Earth were clay minerals—which were probably based on silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Cairns-Smith| first=A. Graham| title= Seven Clues to the Origin of Life| location= Cambridge| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1985| isbn=0-521-27522-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinematic and literary [[science fiction]], a moment when man-made machines cross from nonliving to living, it is often posited, this new form would be the first example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as [[computer]]s (or computer-guided [[robot]]s) and filed under &quot;[[silicon]]-based life&quot;, even though the silicon backing matrix of these processors is not nearly as fundamental to their operation as carbon is for &quot;wet life&quot;.

===Nitrogen and phosphorus biochemistry===
[[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] also offer possibilities as the basis for biochemical molecules. Like carbon, phosphorus can form long chain molecules on its own, which would potentially allow it to form complex [[macromolecule]]s were it not so reactive. However, in combination with nitrogen, it can form much more stable covalent bonds and create a wide range of molecules, including rings (a class of compounds called [[phosphazene]]s).

Earth's atmosphere is approximately 78% nitrogen, but this would probably not be of much use to a phosphorus-nitrogen (P-N) life-form since molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is nearly inert and energetically expensive to &quot;[[nitrogen fixation|fix]]&quot; due to its triple bond. On the other hand, one could say that some Earth [[plant]]s such as [[legume]]s can fix nitrogen using [[Rhizobia|symbiotic bacteria]] contained in their root nodules, but those bacteria have to exist before the nitrogen fixation process they perform can actually take place. On Earth, the intense temperatures created by lightning split atmospheric nitrogen in order to make it available for the first nitrogen containing organisms to use. A [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) atmosphere would be more useful. Nitrogen also forms several oxides, such as [[nitric oxide]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[dinitrogen tetroxide]], and all would be present in a nitrogen-dioxide-rich atmosphere.

* In a nitrogen dioxide atmosphere, P-N plant analogues could absorb nitrogen dioxide from the air and phosphorus from the ground. The nitrogen dioxide would be reduced, with analogues to [[sugar]] being produced in the process, and waste oxygen would be released into the atmosphere. Animals based on phosphorus and nitrogen would consume the plants, use atmospheric oxygen to metabolize the sugar analogues, exhaling nitrogen dioxide and depositing phosphorus, or phosphorus-rich material, as solid waste.
* In an ammonia atmosphere, P-N plants would absorb ammonia from the air and phosphorus from the ground, then oxidize the ammonia to produce P-N sugars and release hydrogen waste. P-N animals are now the reducers, breathing in hydrogen and converting the P-N sugars to ammonia and phosphorus. This is the opposite pattern of oxidation and reduction from a nitrogen dioxide world, and from the known biochemistry of Earth. It would be analogous to Earth's atmospheric carbon supply being in the form of [[methane]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]].

Debate continues, as several aspects of a phosphorus-nitrogen cycle biology would be energy deficient. Also, nitrogen and phosphorus are unlikely to occur in the ratios and quantity required in the universe. Carbon, being preferentially formed during nuclear fusion, is more abundant and is more likely to end up in a preferred location.

Moreover, if an ammoniated atmosphere would be possible and stable at first view (in a reductive environment), it is doubtful that an atmosphere rich in nitrogen dioxide could even exist. Since the nitrogen oxides are all [[Bond energy|endoenergetic]] compared with molecular nitrogen and oxygen; and they are oxidizing, they would decompose by stellar radiation and by catalysis on the surface of rocks when they are produced. Unlike nitrogen dioxide, the chemically similar gas [[nitrogen trifluoride]] is not endoenergetic and is more stable, but the relative rarity of fluorine means that NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is unlikely to be present in large enough concentrations in any atmosphere.

=== Other exotic element-based biochemistries ===

* [[Boron]]'s chemistry is possibly even more variable than that of [[carbon]], since it has the ability to form polyhedral clusters and [[three-center two-electron bond]]s. [[Boranes]] are dangerously explosive in Earth's atmosphere, but would be more stable in a reducing environment. However, boron's low cosmic abundance makes it less likely as a base for life than carbon.
* Various metals, together with oxygen, can form very complex and thermally stable structures rivaling those of organic compounds; the [[heteropoly acid]]s are one such family. Some metal oxides are also similar to carbon in their ability to form both nanotube structures and diamond-like crystals (such as [[cubic zirconia]]). [[Titanium]], [[aluminum]], [[magnesium]] and [[iron]] are all more abundant in the Earth's crust than carbon. Metal oxide-based life could therefore be a possibility under certain conditions, including those (such as high temperatures) at which carbon-based life would be unlikely.
* [[Sulfur]] is also able to form long-chain molecules, but suffers from the same high reactivity problems as phosphorus and silanes. The biological use of sulfur as an alternative to carbon is purely theoretical, especially since sulfur usually forms only linear chains rather than branched ones. (The biological use of sulfur as an electron acceptor is widespread and can be traced back 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years on Earth, thus predating the use of molecular oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5844/1534 Early Archaean Microorganisms Preferred Elemental Sulfur, Not Sulfate] Science AAAS, by Philippot, et al., (14 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria]] can utilize elemental sulfur instead of oxygen, reducing sulfur to [[hydrogen sulfide]].)

==Carbon-based alternatives to hydrocarbons==
In hydrogen-depleted or strongly oxidizing environments, a carbon-based biology in which little to no hydrogen is used might be a possibility. Such &quot;hydrogenless life&quot; would use [[oxocarbon]]s (such as [[mellitic anhydride]] or similar) as its building blocks, instead of hydrocarbons. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Chlorine as an alternative to oxygen==
A number of [[Anaerobic respiration|alternatives to molecular oxygen]] as a terminal electron acceptor are known from [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic life forms]] on Earth. However, it has been proposed that [[chlorine]] might serve as a more general biological alternative to [[oxygen]], either in carbon-based biologies or hypothetical non-carbon-based ones. But chlorine is much less abundant than oxygen in the universe, and so planets with a sufficiently chlorine-rich atmosphere are likely to be rare, if they exist at all. Chlorine will instead likely be bound up as [[salt]]s and other inert compounds.

==Arsenic as an alternative to phosphorus==
{{Main|Arsenic biochemistry}}

[[Arsenic]], which is chemically similar to [[phosphorus]], while poisonous for most [[organism|life form]]s on Earth, is incorporated into the biochemistry of some organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/periodic/elements/as.html |title=Biochemical Periodic Table – Arsenic |publisher=Umbbd.msi.umn.edu |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[marine algae]] incorporate arsenic into complex organic molecules such as [[arsenosugar]]s and [[arsenobetaine]]s. [[Fungi]] and [[bacteria]] can produce volatile methylated arsenic compounds. Arsenate reduction and arsenite oxidation have been observed in [[microbes]] (''[[Chrysiogenes arsenatis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Appl Environ Microbiol| year= 2001| month= December| volume=67| issue=12| pages=5568–80| title= Isolation and characterization of a novel As(V)-reducing bacterium: implications for arsenic mobilization and the genus Desulfitobacterium| last= Niggemyer| first= A| coauthors= Spring S, Stackebrandt E, Rosenzweig RF| doi=10.1128/AEM.67.12.5568-5580.2001| pmid= 11722908| pmc= 93345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some [[prokaryote]]s can use arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor during [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic growth]] and some can utilize arsenite as an electron donor to generate energy.

== Selenium or tellurium as an alternative to sulfur ==
Some organisms are already known to feature [[selenoproteins]], in which sulfur is replaced by selenium. Some fungi also can produce [[tellurium#Biological role|telluro-methionine and telluro-cysteine]]. No organism has yet been shown to ''completely'' replace sulfur with the heavier [[chalcogen]]s, however.

==Non-water solvents==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
In addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires [[water]] as a [[solvent]]. It is sometimes assumed that water is the only suitable chemical to fill this role. Some of the properties of water that are important for life processes include a large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]], a high [[heat capacity]] useful for temperature regulation, a large [[heat of vaporization]], and the ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds. Water is also [[amphoteric]], meaning it can donate and accept a proton allowing it to act as an acid or a base. This property is crucial in many organic and biochemical reactions, where water serves as a solvent, a reactant, or a product. There are other chemicals with similar properties that have sometimes been proposed as alternatives. Additionally, water is the only compound listed here that is less dense as a solid (ice) than as a liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds) then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.

There are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Since boiling points can vary based on the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid phase temperature range at 1 atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|MPa}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.

===Ammonia===
[[Ammonia]] is perhaps the most commonly proposed alternative. Numerous chemical reactions are possible in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has some chemical similarities with water. Ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does, and in addition it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. Given this set of chemical properties it has been theorized that ammonia-based life forms might be possible.

However, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be three times smaller, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. For these reasons, some members of the scientific community{{Who|date=December 2010}} question how well ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system. Ammonia is also flammable and can be oxidized and could not exist sustainably in a biosphere that oxidizes it. It would, however, be stable in a [[reducing environment]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual for terrestrial life on Earth. Terrestrial life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (273&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (373&amp;nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between −78&amp;nbsp;°C (195&amp;nbsp;K) and −33&amp;nbsp;°C (240&amp;nbsp;K). Such extremely cold temperatures create problems, as they slow biochemical reactions tremendously and may cause biochemical [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] out of solution due to high [[melting point]]s. Ammonia could be a liquid at normal temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at −77&amp;nbsp;°C (196&amp;nbsp;K) and boils at 98&amp;nbsp;°C (371&amp;nbsp;K).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Ammonia and ammonia-water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]]. Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of [[Saturn]]'s largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/research/planetary/undergraduate/dom/titan/titan.htm|title=Exobiological Implications of a Possible Ammonia-Water Ocean Inside Titan|last=Fortes|first=A. D.|year=1999|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methane===
A mixture of [[hydrocarbon]]s, such as the methane/ethane lakes detected on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] by the Cassini spacecraft, could act as a solvent over a wide range of temperatures but would lack [[chemical polarity|polarity]]. There is debate about the effectiveness of methane as a medium for life compared to water or ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; While water is a far better solvent than methane, enabling easier transport of substances in a cell,&lt;ref name=methlife&gt;{{cite web|title= What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan?|publisher=NASA/JPL|year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190}}&lt;/ref&gt; methane's lesser chemical reactivity allows for the easier formation of large structures akin to proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.10.003|title=Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe?|author=Steven A Benner�, Alonso Ricardo and Matthew A Carrigan|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|year= 2004|volume=8|issue=6|pages=672–689|url=http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf|accessdate=2010-06-14|pmid=15556414}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]], the [[biochemist]] and [[science fiction]] writer, suggested that poly-[[lipids]] could form a substitute for proteins in a non-polar solvent such as methane or [[liquid hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3aa.html| title=Aliens| work=Atomic Rockets| accessdate=2006-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible evidence for this form of [[life on Titan]] was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of [[Johns Hopkins University]]; an over-abundance of [[molecular hydrogen]] in Titan's upper atmospheric layers, which leads to a downward flow at a rate of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per second. Near the surface the hydrogen apparently disappears, which may imply its consumption by [[methanogenic]] life forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;methlife&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan’s atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions|author=Darrell F. Strobel|journal=Icarus|volume=208|chapter=In press|pages=878|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003|bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckay&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Icarus|volume= 178|issue = 1|pages = 274–276|year= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018|title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author = McKay, C. P.; Smith, H. D.|bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper released the same month showed little evidence of acetylene on Titan's surface, where scientists had expected the compound to accumulate; according Strobel, this is consistent with the hypothesis that acetylene is being consumed by methanogens.&lt;ref name=methlife/&gt; Chris McKay, while agreeing that presence of life is a possible explanation for the findings about hydrogen and acetylene, has cautioned that other explanations are currently more likely: namely the possibility that the results are due to human error, or to the presence of some as-yet unknown [[catalyst]] in the soil.&lt;ref name=life?&gt;{{cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan|author=Chris Mckay|year=2010|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Have_We_Discovered_Evidence_For_Life_On_Titan_999.html|publisher=SpaceDaily|accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that such a catalyst, effective at 95 Kelvin, would in itself be a startling discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;life?&quot;/&gt;

===Hydrogen fluoride===
[[Hydrogen fluoride]], like water, is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. Its melting point is −84&amp;nbsp;°C and its boiling point is 19.54&amp;nbsp;°C (at [[atmospheric pressure]]); the difference between the two is little more than 100&amp;nbsp;°C. HF also makes hydrogen bonds with its neighbor molecules as do water and ammonia. These would make HF a candidate to host life on other planets.

Not much research has been done on liquid HF in regards to its ability to dissolve and react with non-polar molecules. The biota in an HF ocean could use the [[fluorine]] as an electron acceptor to photosynthesize energy.

HF is dangerous to the systems of molecules that earth-life is made of, but the [[paraffin]]s are stable with it.

But presence of great amounts of free HF on a planetary scale, like water on Earth, is only possible outside the temperature range from liquid water and water vapour.  Any free water would be react with the polar HF and would form a solution of [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The hypothetical planet would also surely contain [[silicate]]s that would react with HF to form inert compounds as silicon fluorides, as soon as HF would be present; thus preventing its concentration in great quantities in a hypothetical planetary environment.

The cosmic abundance of [[fluorine]] is low, and it forms chemically inert compounds rapidly in interstellar [[nebulae]], because it is the most reactive element.

===Other solvents or cosolvents===
Other solvents sometimes proposed include [[formamide]], [[methanol]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]]. Hydrogen chloride suffers from the low cosmic abundance of [[chlorine]], while hydrogen sulfide suffers from its high reactivity. Moreover, the first two could not be expected to be found in vast quantities on a planetary scale, and would only be part of the internal physiology of organisms.

A proposal has been made that [[life on Mars]] may exist and be using a mixture of water and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as its solvent. A 61.2% (by weight) mix of water and hydrogen peroxide has a freezing point of −56.5&amp;nbsp;°C, and also tends to [[super-cool]] rather than crystallize. It is also [[hygroscopic]], an advantage in a water-scarce environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EPSC2007/00439/EPSC2007-J-00439.pdf|format=PDF| journal=EPSC Abstracts| volume= 2| id= EPSC2007-A-00439| year=2007| publisher=European Planetary Science Congress 2007| title=The H2O2-H2O Hypothesis: Extremophiles Adapted to Conditions on Mars?| first=Joop M.| last= Houtkooper| coauthors= Dirk Schulze-Makuch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001109/| title=Europlanet : Life's a bleach| date=2007-08-24| first=Doug| last= Ellison| publisher=Planetary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molten salts===

A molten [[salt]], or a [[eutectic]] mixture of such salts, could remain liquid at extremely high temperatures,{{specify|date=March 2011}} and could theoretically act as a solvent.  Life in such circumstances may be restricted to [[refractory material]]s like metal oxides.  The participation of metal oxide compounds in a biochemical system is unlikely, as their molecular structures are simpler compared to organic compounds and they are largely inert.

==Other types of speculations==
===Non-green photosynthesizers===
Physicists have noted that, while photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than that received on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html |title=NASA – NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kiang&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

These conclusions are based in part on the luminosity spectra of different types of stars, the transmission characteristics of hypothetical planetary atmospheres, and the absorption spectra of various photosynthetic pigments from organisms on Earth.

The first plants on Earth may have been a slightly different colour, because the [[Sun]] was, in the first geological eons, a little less bright, and its light was filtered by passing through an atmosphere with a different composition.

===Alternative atmospheres===
The gases present in the atmosphere on Earth have varied greatly over its history. Traditional plant photosynthesis has [[terraformed]] the atmosphere by sequestering carbon from carbon dioxide, increasing the proportion of molecular oxygen, and by participating in the [[nitrogen cycle]]. Modern oxygen breathing animals would have been biochemically impossible until earlier photosynthetic life transformed Earth's atmosphere. The first dramatic rise in atmospheric oxygen on Earth, to about a tenth of its present-day value, occurred approximately 2.5 billion years ago, and that level did not change significantly until the Cambrian era approximately 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Jones| first=Barrie W.| title= The Search for Life Continued: Planets Around Other Stars| location= Chichester, UK| publisher=Praxis Publishing| year=2008| isbn=13: 978-0-387-76557-0| page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the gas mixture in the atmosphere, even in an atmosphere made up predominantly of the same molecules of Earth's atmosphere, impacts the biochemistry and morphology of life. For example, periods of high oxygen concentrations determined from ice core samples have been associated with fauna of a larger scale in the fossil record, while periods associated with of low oxygen concentrations have been associated with fauna of a smaller scale in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/309/5744/2202 |title=Science, &quot;The Rise of Oxygen over the Past 205 Million Years and the Evolution of Large Placental Mammals&quot; (30 September 2005) |doi=10.1126/science.1116047 |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, while it is customary to think of plants on one side of the oxygen and nitrogen cycles as being sessile, and of animals on the other side as being motile, this is not a biological imperative. There are animals which are sessile for all or most of their lives (such as [[corals]]), and there are plants (such as [[tumbleweed]]s, and [[venus fly trap]]s) that exhibit more mobility than is customarily associated with plants. On a slowly rotating planet, for example, it might be adaptive for photosynthesis to be performed by &quot;plants&quot; that can move to remain in the light, like Earth's [[sunflower]]s; while non-photosynthetic &quot;animals&quot;, much like Earth's [[fungi]], might have a lesser need to move from place to place on their own. This would be a mirror image of Earth's [[ecology]].

===Variable environments===
Many Earth plants and animals undergo major biochemical changes during their life cycles as a response to changing environmental conditions, for example, by having a [[spore]] or [[hibernation]] state that can be sustained for years or even millennia between more active life stages. Thus, it would be biochemically possible to sustain life in environments that are only periodically consistent with life as we know it.

For example, frogs in cold climates can survive for extended periods of time with most of their body water in a frozen state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/yellowstone/hibernate.html |title=Christmas in Yellowstone |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; while desert frogs in Australia can become inactive and dehydrate in dry periods, losing up to 75% of their fluids, yet return to life by rapidly rehydrating in wet periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1933854 Main and Bentley, Ecology, &quot;Water Relations of Australian Burrowing Frogs and Tree Frogs&quot; (1964)]&lt;/ref&gt; Either type of frog would appear biochemically inactive (i.e. not living) during dormant periods to anyone lacking a sensitive means of detecting low levels of metabolism.

==Nonplanetary life==
===Dust and plasma-based===
In 2007 [[V. N. Tsytovich]] and colleagues proposed that life-like behaviors could be exhibited by dust particles suspended in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], under conditions that might exist in space.&lt;ref name=&quot;dust1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070814150630.htm| date=2007-08-15| publisher=Science Daily| title=Physicists Discover Inorganic Dust With Lifelike Qualities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dust2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1367-2630/9/8/263| title=From plasma crystals and helical structures towards inorganic living matter| journal= New J.

and evolving into more stable forms. Similar forms of life were described in [[Fred Hoyle]]'s classic novel ''[[The Black Cloud]]''.

==Usage in fiction==
{{In popular culture|date=May 2011}}
In the realm of science fiction, there have occasionally been forms of life proposed that, while often highly speculative and unsupported by rigorous theoretical examination, are nevertheless interesting and in some cases even plausible.

===Novels, short stories and comics===
In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s short story &quot;Technical Error&quot; there is an example of differing [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]. This is not a case of alien life, rather it is an accident. A technical error in a new power plant changes the chirality of a worker. He cannot read because he sees all type as reversed, and he believes his left side is his right. The amusement ends when it is discovered that he is dying from malnutrition because his new biology cannot utilize normal food.

The concept of reversed chirality also figured prominently in the plot of [[James Blish]]'s ''Star Trek'' novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', where a transporter experiment gone awry ends up creating a duplicate Spock who turns out to be a perfect mirror-image of the original all the way down to the atomic level.

An example of silicon based life forms takes place in the [[Alan Dean Foster]] novel ''[[Sentenced to Prism]]'' in which the protagonist Evan Orgell is trapped on a planet whose entire ecosystem is mostly silicon-based.

Perhaps the most extreme example in science fiction is [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''[[Sector General]]'': a series of novels and short stories about multienvironment hospital for the strangest life-forms imaginable, some of them breathing methane, chlorine, water and sometimes also oxygen. Some of the species ''metabolise'' directly hard radiation and their environment doesn't differ much from the atmosphere of a star, while others live in near absolute zero temperatures. All life forms are classified according to their metabolism, internal and external features, and more extreme abilities (telepathy, empathy, hive mind, etc.) with four letter codes. Humans from Earth share the ''DBDG'' specification with small furry beings called Nidians.

One of the major sentient species in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld (world)|Discworld]]'' universe are the &quot;earth&quot;-based (ranging from Detritus to Diamond) [[Troll (Discworld)|Trolls]].

Pratchett has also written the science fiction novel ''[[The Dark Side of the Sun]]'' which features a range of extraordinary life-forms, including a telepathic body of water, creatures called &quot;Sundogs&quot;, which are capable of interstellar travel from birth, and a sentient planet: effectively a giant silicon-based computer.

[[Fred Hoyle]]'s classic novel ''[[The Black Cloud]]'' features a life form consisting of a vast cloud of interstellar dust, the individual particles of which interact via electromagnetic signalling analogous to how the individual cells of multicellular terrestrial life interact. Outside of science-fiction, life in interstellar dust has been proposed as part of the [[panspermia]] hypothesis. The low temperatures and densities of interstellar clouds would seem to imply that life processes would operate much more slowly there than on Earth. Inorganic dust-based life has been speculated upon based on recent computer simulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;dust2&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;[[Crusade (short story)|Crusade]]&quot; revolves around a planetwide life-form based on silicon and superfluid helium located in deep intergalactic space, processing its thoughts slowly by human standards, that sends probes to look for similar life in nearby galaxies. It concludes that it needs to make planets more habitable for similar life-forms, and sends out other probes to foment [[supernova]]e to do so. Clarke implies that this is what accounts for most supernovae having occurred in the same region of space and warns that the effort will eventually reach Earth.

[[Robert L. Forward]]'s ''[[Camelot 30K]]'' describes an ecosystem on the surface of [[Kuiper belt object]]s that is based on a [[fluorocarbon]] chemistry with [[oxygen difluoride|OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the principal solvent instead of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The organisms in this ecology keep warm by secreting a pellet of [[uranium-235]] inside themselves and then moderating its nuclear fission using a [[boron]]-rich carapace around it. Kuiper belt objects are known to be rich in organic compounds such as [[tholin]]s, so some form of life existing on their surfaces is not entirely implausible–though perhaps not going so far as to develop natural internal nuclear reactors, as have Forward's. Fluorine is also of low cosmic abundance, so its use in this manner is unlikely.

In Forward's ''[[Rocheworld]]'' series, an Earth-like biochemistry is proposed that uses a mixture of water and ammonia as its solvent. In ''[[Dragon's Egg]]'' and ''[[Starquake (book)|Starquake]]'', Forward proposes life on the surface of a [[neutron star]] utilizing &quot;nuclear chemistry&quot; in the [[degenerate matter]] crust. Since such life utilised [[strong nuclear force]]s instead of [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetic interactions]], it was posited that life might function millions of times faster than typical on Earth.

[[Gregory Benford]] and [[David Brin]]'s ''[[Heart of the Comet]]'' features a [[comet]] with a conventional carbon-and-water-based ecosystem that becomes active near the [[perihelion]] when the Sun warms it. Brin's own novel ''[[Sundiver]]'' is an example of science fiction proposing a form of life existing within the [[Plasma physics|plasma]] atmosphere of a [[star]] using complex self-sustaining [[magnetic field]]s. Similar sorts of plasmoid life have sometimes been proposed to exist in other places, such as planetary [[ionosphere]]s or the [[interstellar medium]], but usually only by fringe theorists (see [[ball lightning]] for some additional discussion).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Gregory Benford had a form of plasma-based life exist in the [[accretion disk]] of a [[primordial black hole]] in his novel ''[[Eater (novel)|Eater]]''.

The suggestion that life could even occur within the plasma of a star has been picked up by other science fiction writers, as in [[David Brin|David Brin's]] [[uplift Universe|Uplift Saga]] or [[Frederik Pohl|Frederik Pohl's]] novel ''[[The World at the End of Time]]''. The idea is that places where reactions occur–even an incredible environment as a star–presents a possible medium for some chain of events that could produce a system able to replicate.

The [[Outsider (Known Space)|Outsiders]] in [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe are [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] creatures based on [[liquid helium]]. They derive [[Thermoelectricity|thermoelectric energy]] from a temperature gradient by basking half their body in sunlight, keeping the other half in shadow and exposed to interstellar vacuum.

[[Stephen Baxter]] has imagined perhaps some of the most unusual exotic life-forms in his [[Xeelee]] series of novels and stories, including [[supersymmetric]] [[photino]]-based life that congregate in the gravity wells of stars, entities composed of [[quantum]] [[wave function]]s, and the Qax, who thrive in any form of [[convection cell]]s, from swamp gas to the atmospheres of [[gas giant]]s. In his book ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', he also proposes natural robots, life forms made of [[iron]], called the Gaijin, evolving from creatures in oceans of [[iron carbonyl]].

In his novel ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'', [[Greg Egan]] posits entire virtual universes implemented on [[Turing Machine]]s encoded by [[Wang tile|Wang Tiles]] in gargantuan [[polysaccharide]] 'carpets.' The sentient ocean that covers much of the surface of Solaris in [[Stanislaw Lem]]'s [[Solaris (novel)|eponymous novel]] also seems, from much of the fictional research quoted and discussed in the book, to be based on some element other than carbon. In the same novel Egan describes lifeforms in the 6-D 'macrosphere' which use a collapsed atom chemistry with energetic processes of the same order as nuclear reactions, due to the peculiarities of higher dimensional physics.

In her novel ''[[Brain Plague (novel)|Brain Plague]]'', [[Joan Slonczewski]] describes a species of intelligent microrganisms with [[arsenic]] based chemistries that live symbiotically with human hosts.

[[Schlock Mercenary characters#Sergeant Schlock|Sergeant Schlock]] is one of the lead characters in the webcomic ''[[Schlock Mercenary]]''. His species, [[Schlock Mercenary characters#Amorphs|Carbosilicate Amorphs]], evolved from self-repairing distributed [[data storage devices]], and as such, redundantly distribute their 'brain' throughout their body. They are highly resistant to [[hard vacuum]], [[explosive decompression]], [[projectile weapons]], chemical-based explosives, and dismemberment. Their only specialty organ is their eyes, which they harvest as fruit from the Ghanj-Rho eye-tree on their home planet. While the Amorphs have the ability to move fast, quietly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060905.html |title=Schlock Mercenary archives – Tuesday, September 5, 2006 |publisher=Schlockmercenary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sprout appendages at will, they excel at 'closer-than-melee-range combat, primarily &quot;meme-toxins&quot; against other Amorphs.

A more farcical example comes from ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', where the Hooloovoo are a hyperintelligent shade of the colour blue.

Alien warriors recruited by the god Klael in [[David Eddings]]' &quot;[[The Tamuli|Tamuli]]&quot; trilogy are noted by their human opponents to breathe marsh-gas (methane). Within Eddings' universe, this limits their capacity for exertion in an oxygen atmosphere, and also determines the tactics used to fight them and eventually to destroy them in their encampments.

The eponymous organism in [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' is described as reproducing via the direct conversion of energy into matter.

===''Star Trek''===
[[Image:STDevilDark.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[Horta (Star Trek)|Horta]], a fictional silicon-based life-form in the [[Star Trek]] universe.]]
A well-known example of a non–carbon-based life-form in science fiction is the [[Horta (Star Trek)|Horta]] in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;[[The Devil in the Dark (TOS episode)|Devil in the Dark]]&quot;. A highly intelligent silicon-based creature made almost entirely of pure rock, it tunnels through rock as easily as humans move through air. The entire species dies out every 50,000&amp;nbsp;years except for one who tends for all the eggs, which take the form of silicon nodules scattered throughout the caverns and tunnels of its home planet, [[List of Star Trek planets: G-L#J|Janus VI]]. The inadvertent destruction of many of these eggs by a human mining colony led the mother Horta to respond by killing the colonists and sabotaging their equipment; it was only through a [[Vulcan mind meld]] that the race's benevolence and intelligence were discovered and peaceful relations established.

''Star Trek'' would later offer other corporeal life-forms with an alternative biochemistry. The [[Tholian]]s of &quot;[[The Tholian Web]]&quot; are depicted and described, in that episode and later in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode &quot;[[In a Mirror, Darkly (Enterprise episode)|In a Mirror, Darkly]]&quot; as being primarily of mineral-based composition and thriving only in superheated conditions. Another episode from ''TOS'''s third season, &quot;[[The Savage Curtain]]&quot;, depicted another rock creature called an Excalbian, which is believed in [[List of fan fiction terms#Fanon|fanon]] to also have been silicon-based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/startrek/episodes/77.html SciFi.com StarTrek] ''[[Syfy]]''{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{'}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Excalbian |title=Excalbian. Memory Alpha |publisher=Memory-alpha.org |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the [[Crystalline Entity]] appeared in two episodes, &quot;[[Datalore]]&quot; and &quot;[[Silicon Avatar]]&quot;. This was an enormous spacefaring [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]] that had taken thousands of lives in its quest for energy. It may have been unaware of this, however, but it was destroyed before communications could be established at a level sufficient to ascertain it.

In another episode, &quot;[[Home Soil]]&quot;, intelligent crystals that formed a &quot;microbrain&quot; were discovered during a terraforming mission, and they described the humans they encountered as &quot;ugly bags of mostly water.&quot;

&quot;The Disease&quot;, an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' featured some artificially-engineered silicon-based parasites, and an ''Enterprise'' episode, &quot;[[Observer Effect (Enterprise episode)|Observer Effect]]&quot;, also presented a lethal silicon-based virus.
In another Voyager episode, &quot;Hope and Fear&quot;, a [[xenon]]-based life-form was mentioned. In the ''Enterprise'' episode &quot;The Communicator&quot;, an alien species is encountered whose blood chemistry, while not explicitly stated, is sufficiently different from terrestrial organisms that it is not red and iron is toxic to it.

===''Star Wars''===
In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', two life-forms were encountered by the characters that were non-carbon based entities. Although details of their physiology were not mentioned on screen, the [[space slug]], (a giant worm-like creature that lived on asteroids in the freezing vacuum of space),&lt;ref&gt;{{Databank|category=creature|subject=spaceslug|text=Space Slug}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Sww|Exogorth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mynock]], (pesky bat-like vermin that would attach to spaceship hulls and chew through power conduits to feed off the raw energy),&lt;ref&gt;{{Databank|category=creature|subject=mynock|text=Mynock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Sww|Mynock}}&lt;/ref&gt; are said to be silicon-based organisms in [[Star Wars Expanded Universe]] sources. Also from ''The Empire Strikes Back'', the [[bounty hunter]] Zuckuss is a member of the [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Gand|Gand]] race, an ammonia-based life-form. However, it is worth noting that the Gand are divided into two subspecies, only one of which breathes at all, the other drawing all their required sustenance from food intake and producing speech by essentially modulated [[flatulence]].

Appearing only in the [[Star Wars Expanded Universe]] is the [[List of Star Wars creatures#Spice spider|spice spider]] of [[List of Star Wars planets (K-L)|Kessel]], a creature made of [[Spice (Star Wars)|glitterstim spice]] and silicon that spun crystalline webs harvested by miners as glitterstim spice, an illegal [[psychoactive]] [[narcotic]]. The spider used the webs to catch bogeys, tiny energy creatures that it consumed for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sww|Energy spider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuswe.org/newdescr.asp?search=7930 |title=Energy Spider. The Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia |publisher=Cuswe.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other film and television===
* In the movie ''[[Titan A.E.]]'', an alien race called the Drej were composed of a coherent plasma.
* In the movie ''[[The Monolith Monsters]]'', a silicon meteor reproduces, draining silicates from everything it touches. It needs water to start its cycle and contains molecular structures typical of many kinds of rocks, mixed together. A geologist says that its structure is nearly impossible. The meteor is killed by salt water, which can stop the cycle.
* In [[Firewalker_(The_X-Files)|Firewalker]], a [[The X-Files (season 2)|second-season episode]] of ''[[The X-Files]]'', a silicon-based plant that infects humans [[parasite|parasitically]] through its [[spore]]s is discovered living deep in a [[volcano]].
* Also from ''The X-Files'', the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first-season episode]] &quot;[[Ice (The X-Files)|Ice]]&quot; deals with an ammonia-based [[vermiform]] [[parasite]].
* A key plot point in the [[comedy]] ''[[Evolution (film)|Evolution]]'' involves [[nitrogen]]-based life forms, and using [[selenium]]-based [[shampoo]] to poison them (with the bonus of a product placement for [[Head &amp; Shoulders]]).
* In the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' fourth season episode &quot;[[Scorched Earth]]&quot;, a Human society known as the [[Enkarans]] are threatened on their new homeworld by an alien ship that is terraforming the planet to be suitable for the [[sulfur]]-based [[Gadmeer]] species.
* In the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' fifth season episode &quot;[[Remnants (Stargate Atlantis)|Remnants]]&quot;, a device is found whose purpose was to seed a planet with [[silicon]]-based life.
* In ''[[Ben 10]]'', both the Omnitrix alien [[List of Omnitrix aliens#Diamondhead|Diamondhead]] and the alien [[bounty hunter]] [[List of Omnitrix aliens#Tetrax Shard|Tetrax Shard]] are members of the Petrosapien species, which are a form of silicon-based life.  Other silicon-based lifeforms on the show include the Omnitrix aliens Chromostone (who is crystalline), and Echo Echo and Upgrade (who are both biomechanical).  Other member's of Upgrade's species have appeared, including the shape-shifting &quot;Ship,&quot; a pet of Ben's girlfriend, Julie.
* In ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', shortly before the destruction of [[Planet Namek]], [[Frieza]] tells [[Goku]] that he does not need to breathe. This would allow him to survive the destruction of the planet and suggest that he is not a carbon-based life-form.
* ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008) introduces thirteen &quot;extra dimensional beings&quot; with [[crystal skull|crystal skeletons]], who founded a city that became the basis of the [[El Dorado]] myth. Though their flesh has died and rotted away, their minds still live on within their skeletons, which communicate [[telepathic]]ally.
* An episode (&quot;The Chrysalids&quot;) of the series ''[[Space: 1999]]'' presents [[humanoid]]s on a planet protected by a electric waves system, which are living in a chlorine atmosphere.
*The episode &quot;The Stones of Blood&quot;, of the 16th season of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Fourth Doctor encounters the Ogri, a silicon-based life form, and in the same sub-plot, the Megara, who are made entirely out of an unknown substance, possibly energy, and they uphold the word of the law, and execute all who break the law with a beam of energy.

===Computer and video games===
In the ''[[Command &amp; Conquer series|Command &amp; Conquer]]'' [[real-time strategy]] games, both the gameplay and storyline revolve heavily around the introduction to Earth of an extraterrestrial mutagen called [[Tiberium]] via meteor, which displays strikingly lifelike behaviours such as self-replication, evolution, and homeostasis, without undergoing anything like common carbon-based metabolic cycles, and which appears to be colonising the Earth, converting it into an environment unsuited to carbon-based biology. Earth creatures (such as animals, plants and even humans) exposed to Tiberium can either be killed because of the radiation or be transformed into Tiberium-based life-forms, to whom Tiberium radiation is curative rather than toxic. It is later revealed that Tiberium was introduced to earth by the [[Scrin]], an extremely advanced race of Tiberium-based aliens bent on mining the planet after the Tiberium deposits have reached maturity.

In the ''[[Halo (video game series)|Halo]]'' video game series, a race of Covenant aliens named &quot;Grunts&quot; by humans require a breathing apparatus while fighting the humans in an Earth-like atmosphere. According to the novelizations of the video game, the Grunts' apparatus allows them to breathe the methane they need to survive.

In the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series of space strategy games, there exists an extraterrestrial race called Silicoids, whose appearance (and presumably composition) is similar to crystalline mineral structures. The game posits that this grants them immunity to the effects of hostile environments and pollution and they require no sustenance, at the expense of impeding their reproductive rate and their ability to interact with other intelligent species.

In the ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' series, [[Metroid (series)#Phazon|Phazon]] is a highly radioactive, self regenerating mineral with organic properties that is generated by the sentient planet Phaaze.

In ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'', Spire is a rock-like, silicon based alien. He is the last Diamont (presumably a play on the word [[diamond]], which is composed of [[carbon]]).

In the ''[[Submarine TITANS]]'' strategy game,  the alien race in the game are called &quot;the Silicons&quot; because they are silicon based life forms.

In the ''[[Star Control]]'' series, the [[Chenjesu]], are hyperintelligent, peaceful silicon-based life-forms that were the backbone of the Alliance of Free Stars. Their crystalline biology apparently gives them the ability to send and receive hyperwave transmissions. Also, there are the [[Slylandro]] who are gas beings residing in the upper atmosphere of a [[gas giant]]. As well, there are evidences of another silicon-based race, the [[Taalo]] who are described by the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] [[Ur-Quan]] as the only race to have not awakened their territorial instincts. The Taalo were also immune to mind control

In the game of ''[[Xenosaga]]'', artificial life forms known as Realians have been created using silicon-based chemistry. They resemble humans in every aspect, except they are considered to be lower than humans on the social [[ladder]].

In ''[[Mass Effect]]'' the alien [[List of races in the Mass Effect universe#Turians|Turians]] and [[List of races in the Mass Effect universe#Quarians|Quarians]], are both based on dextro-amino acids, as opposed to the all other sentient species of the galaxy based on levo-amino acids. There are also the [[List of races in the Mass Effect universe#Volus|Volus]], an ammonia based species that must wear pressure suits to survive in environments suited to the other races.

In ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', the [[Grox (Spore)|Grox]] refer to the player and to other alien empires as &quot;slow thinking carbon-based lifeforms&quot; and &quot;carbon wads&quot;, implying that the Grox (which are at least partly machine life) are not carbon-based. Also, the Grox can only exist on barren planets which cannot support other life, and when a planet is terraformed the Grox inhabiting it die immediately. The Grox seem to gather sustenance from the radiation from the galactic core, as the Grox colonies are larger the closer they are to the galactic core.

A '''creation myth''' or '''creation story''' is a symbolic narrative of a culture, tradition or people that describes their earliest beginnings, how the world they know began and how they first came into it.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;womack&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Womack|2005|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leeming 2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creation myths develop in [[oral tradition]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;womack&quot;/&gt; and are the most common form of [[myth]], found throughout human [[culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kimball&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kimball|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Braziller|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the society in which it is told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound [[truth (religious)|truths]], although not necessarily in a [[history|historical]] or literal sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;kimball&quot;/&gt;  They are commonly, although not always, considered ''[[cosmogonical]] myths''—that is they describe the ordering of the [[cosmos]] from a state of [[chaos]] or amorphousness.&lt;ref&gt;''See:''

==Classification==
[[File:Ask and Embla by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|A depiction of [[Ask and Embla]] from a [[Norse mythology|Norse creation myth]].]]
[[Mythologist]]s have applied various schemes to classify creation myths found throughout human cultures.  Eliade and his student, Charles H. Long, developed a classification based on some common [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that reappear in stories the world over.  The classification identifies five basic types:&lt;ref name=&quot;lm3233&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being
* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world
* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world
* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being
* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing into form from [[chaos]]

Marta Weigle further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.&lt;ref name=&quot;lm3233&quot;/&gt;

An alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond  Van Over:&lt;ref name=&quot;lm3233&quot;/&gt;
*a primeval abyss, an infinite expanse of waters or space
*an originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss
*an originator deity poised above the abyss
*a cosmic egg or [[embryo]]
*an originator deity creating life through sound or word

All creation myths are in one sense [[etiological]] because they attempt to explain how the world was formed and where humanity came from.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leeming 2005&quot;/&gt; While in popular usage the term &quot;myth&quot; is often thought to refer to false or fanciful stories, creation myths are by definition those stories which a culture accepts as both a true and foundational account of their human identity.  Ethnologists and anthropologists who study these myths point out that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a literal or logical sense.  However they are today seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context.  Charles H. Long writes, &quot;The beings referred to in the myth -- gods, animals, plants -- are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to both the spiritual and natural world as well as to each other.  The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of being from non-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason.  And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological_myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life.  Creation myths also serve as a framework for humanity's sense of self in terms of ultimate origins, shaping concepts of place, time and purpose in the world.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation ''ex nihilo'' (L. &quot;from nothing&quot;) is thought to be the most common type of creation described in these stories. It is the type of creation described in the [[Genesis creation narrative]] in the [[Bible]] in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], and also in the [[Koran]]'s [[Al-A'raf|Sura VII]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|Leaman|2004|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=zLxBQrY6inEC&amp;pg=PA408 408]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=q_Gqxe2ZDqkC&amp;pg=PA144 144]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as &quot;creation ''de novo''&quot;. Besides in the Bible, ''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]] and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1–3,153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Debate between sheep and grain]] is an example of an even earlier form of ''ex nihilo'' creation myth from ancient [[Sumer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wasilewska2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Wasilewska|title=Creation stories of the Middle East|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sMj1tyho3CoC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9781853026812|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ''ex nihilo'' may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.  The literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is &quot;from nothing&quot; but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos.  With ''ex nihilo,'' the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them. In creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|page=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation from chaos===
{{main|Chaos (cosmogony)}}
In creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word &quot;chaos&quot; means &quot;disorder&quot;, and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss
