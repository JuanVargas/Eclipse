{{nihongo|'''''The Big O'''''|THE ビッグオー}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime|animated]] [[television series]] created by director Kazuyoshi Katayama and designer [[Keiichi Sato]] for [[Sunrise Studios]]. The writing staff was assembled by the series' head writer, [[Chiaki J. Konaka]].

The story takes place forty years after a mysterious occurrence causes the residents of [[Paradigm City]] to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City's top [[Negotiator]]. He provides this much needed service with the help of a [[gynoid]] named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his [[butler]] Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon Big O, a giant relic from the city's past.

The television series is designed as a tribute to Japanese and [[western world|Western]] shows from the 1960s and 1970s. The series is done in the style of ''[[film noir]]'' and combines the feel of a [[detective fiction|detective show]] with the [[mecha anime|mecha genre]] of anime. The [[setpiece]]s are reminiscent of [[Toho]] [[kaiju|monster movies]] and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.

''The Big O'' premiered 13 October 1999 on [[WOWOW]] satellite television. It finished its run on 19 January 2000. The English language version premiered on [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]] on 2 April 2001. Originally a 13-episode series, positive fan response internationally resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and [[Bandai Visual]]. Season two premiered on Japan's [[SUN-TV]] on January 2003, with the American [[premiere]] taking place seven months later.

== Plot ==
{{See also|List of The Big O episodes}}
Forty years prior to the events of the series, disaster struck. The world was turned into a vast desert wasteland and the survivors were left without memories. The story takes place in Paradigm City, a corporate police state run by the Paradigm [[Megacorporation|Corporation]]. The town is recognized for its [[geodesic dome]]s, giant structures that house the richer citizens and segregate the poor.

''The Big O'' deals with the nature of memories. A [[memory]] is a record stored in the brain of an organism, but in Paradigm City memories can mean much more.&lt;ref&gt;Note the series uses the spelling {{nihongo|&quot;Memory&quot;|メモリー|Memorī}} instead of {{nihongo|&quot;memory&quot;|記憶|kioku}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|&quot;Memories&quot;|メモリー|Memorī}} embody the lost knowledge of its residents, and can take the form of records from before the Event, forgotten artifacts from the previous era or manifest themselves as recollection, [[hallucination]]s and [[recurring dream]]s.

The first half of the series is episodic. Each Act revolves around different citizens of Paradigm dealing with the resurgence of lost Memories and how they manage to go on living without knowledge of what did or did not happen. The final episodes introduce elements that come into play during season two like the existence of people outside of Paradigm City, the nature of the [[Cataclysm]] that destroyed the world and the &quot;Power of God wielded by the hand of man.&quot;

The second season takes an [[Story arc|arc-based approach]]. Instead of self-contained stories like in season one, season two features a continuous storyline. The second season makes [[List of The Big O characters#Alex Rosewater|Alex Rosewater]], [[CEO]] of the Paradigm Corporation, a direct [[antagonist]] to The Negotiator and introduces The Union, agents of a foreign power working within Paradigm.

===Ending===
The series ends with the awakening of other &quot;Big&quot; [[megadeus]] and the revelation that the universe is a [[simulated reality]] created by advanced [[virtual reality]] technology of unknown origin. A climactic battle ensues, after which the universe is systematically deleted and reset. However, this ending has been thoroughly debated. Many fans feel it was simply symbolism. The true nature of the ending remains unknown and open to interpretation.

=== Paradigm City ===
[[File:Paradigm City.JPG|thumb|left|240px|An [[aerial shot]] of Paradigm City. The city is based on the island of [[Manhattan]] and is suggested to be [[New York City]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Big O Visual'': Official Companion to &quot;The Big-O&quot; TV series (ISBN 4-575-29579-5), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Paradigm City''' is a fictional [[city-state]] which serves as the main setting of the [[anime]] series ''The Big O''. Located on a sea coast and surrounded by a vast desert wasteland, the partially [[geodesic dome|dome]]d city is wholly controlled by the monopolistic Paradigm Corporation. ''The Big O'' takes place forty years after &quot;The Event,&quot; an unknown occurrence which destroys the world outside the city and leaves the survivors without any memories. In the final episodes of the series, the city is implied to have been an elaborate fabrication produced by an unknown power.

The city is characterized by severe class inequity; the higher-income population resides inside the more pleasant [[geodesic domes]], with the remainder left in tenements outside. [[android (robot)|Android]]s coexist with the human inhabitants of Paradigm City; while their numbers are fairly low, and they're something of a rarity, there are enough of them that denizens of the city are not shocked by them and don't consider it particularly unusual to encounter one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WiLuAAAAMAAJ |title=Television cartoon shows: an illustrated encyclopedia |volume=1 |author=Hal Erickson |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co. |isbn=9780786422555 |date=2005-07 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several episodes show inhabitants of Paradigm City practicing some shape or form of [[Christianity]], as people congregate in meeting places with crucifixes prominently displayed. However, the practice appears to be based on custom rather than doctrine, which no one remembers. A cathedral is shown in ruins and forgotten, although some elderly people occasionally feel compelled to stand in front of it and sing scraps of hymns. It is revealed in episode 11 that almost no one remembers [[Christmas]].

A holiday is observed on December 25, but as a celebration to commemorate the founding of Paradigm City, known as &quot;Heaven's Day.&quot; The inhabitants of the city still put up generic Christmas decorations like decorated Christmas trees and streamers, but they don't really know the underlying reason behind all of this. Alex Rosewater seems to be the series' only character with knowledge of pre-Event Christianity. Dastun at one point mentions that Rosewater had in his possession fragments of a &quot;[[Book of Revelation]]&quot;, although neither Dastun nor Roger had previously heard of it. It is possible that Rosewater also has other fragments of [[The Bible]], as Rosewater describes the real meaning of Heaven's Day as being &quot;the day God's son was born.&quot;

== Characters ==
{{Main|List of The Big O characters}}
;Roger Smith
Roger Smith is the series's [[protagonist]]. As a [[Negotiator]], his job entails finding a resolution for the troubles of the City of Amnesia. He'd negotiate almost anything for anyone, but he is a professional and expects the parties involved to behave professionally. When memories betray the people and force them to reawaken monstrosities of the city's past, Roger's only option is to fight back with a monstrosity of his own, the black [[megadeus]] [[Big O (mecha)|Big O]]. Roger is voiced by Mitsuru Miyamoto in Japanese and [[Steven Blum]] in English.

;R. Dorothy Wayneright
R. Dorothy Wayneright is Roger's assistant. Introduced in Act:01 as Dorothy Soldano, daughter of rich industrialist Miguel Soldano, she is later revealed to be a [[gynoid]] constructed by him. Her actual &quot;father&quot; would be Timothy Wayneright, the man who commissioned her construction and father of the real and late Dorothy Wayneright. To show her gratitude, and as a form of payment for Roger's help, she decides to move in with him and help out Norman with the chores. Dorothy is voiced by Akiko Yajima in Japanese and [[Lia Sargent]] in English. The character's name is consistent with naming practices in the [[science fiction]] works of [[Isaac Asimov]], the first initial &quot;R&quot; standing for &quot;[[robot]]&quot;.

;Norman Burg
Norman Burg is Roger's [[butler]]. Forty years before the commencement of the story, Norman, like the rest of Paradigm, lost all memories from before that day, but he would not think twice before going once more unto the breach for his master. Resourceful and talented, he is also [[property caretaker|caretaker]] of the Big O. Norman's skills give him a purpose and a mission to accomplish for Roger. Norman is voiced by Motomu Kiyokawa in Japanese and Milton James and Alan Oppenheimer in English for seasons one and two respectively.

;Dan Dastun
Dan Dastun is the [[middle-aged]] Chief of the Military Police, introduced in Act:01. He is Roger's former commander and the Negotiator's contact in the police force. Roger describes him as &quot;a hard-nosed cop [who is] completely devoted to the force&quot; and with &quot;more pride in the Military Police than anything else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Winter Night Phantom | series = The Big O | credits = [[Keiichi Hasegawa]] (writer) | network = [[WOWOW]] | airdate = 1999-12-15 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan is voiced by Tesshou Genda in Japanese and Peter Lurie in English.

;Angel
Angel is the beautiful woman Roger encounters throughout the series. Introduced in Act:03 as Casey Jenkins, investigator for Paradigm Power Management, then again in Act:04 as Patricia Lovejoy, secretary for the publisher of Paradigm Press. Angel's true identity is a mystery, her motives questionable and her allegiance to no one but herself. Angel is voiced by Emi Shinohara in Japanese and [[Wendee Lee]] in English.

== Production and release ==
Development of the [[retro]]-styled series began in 1996. [[Keiichi Sato]] came up with the concept of ''The Big O'': a giant city-smashing robot, piloted by a man in black, in a [[Gotham City|Gotham]]-like environment. He later met up with Kazuyoshi Katayama, who had just finished directing ''[[Those Who Hunt Elves]]'', and started work on the layouts and character designs. But when things &quot;were about to really start moving,&quot; production on Katayama's ''[[Sentimental Journey (anime)|Sentimental Journey]]'' began, putting plans on-hold. Meanwhile, Sato was heavily involved with his work on ''[[City Hunter]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;&gt;{{cite DVD-notes | title = The Big O Vol. 1 | titleyear = 1999 | director = Kazuyoshi Katayama | format = Textual interview | publisher = Bandai Entertainment | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sato admits it all started as &quot;a gimmick for a toy&quot; but the representatives at Bandai Hobby Division did not see the same [[toyetic|potential]].&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;/&gt; From there on, the dealings would be with [[Bandai Visual]], but [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] still needed some safeguards and requested more robots be designed to increase prospective toy sales. In 1999, with the designs complete, [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] was brought on as head writer. Among other things, Konaka came up with the idea of &quot;a town without memory&quot; and his writing staff put together the outline for a 26-episodes series.&lt;ref name = &quot;Konakajump&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20030629040803/www.animejump.com/cgi-bin/go.cgi?go=features/big-o/konaka | title = THE BIG O! Chiaki J. Konaka Interview | publisher = Anime Jump | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big O'' premiered on 13 October 1999 on [[WOWOW]]. When the production staff was informed the series would be shortened to 13 episodes, the writers decided to end it with a [[cliffhanger]], hoping the next 13 episodes would be picked up.&lt;ref name=&quot;konaka&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.konaka.com/alice6/big-o/ | title = ''The Big O'' (production notes) | accessdate = 2006-11-18 | author = Chiaki J. Konaka | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2001, ''The Big O'' premiered on [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-03-27/large-toonami-updates|title=Large Toonami Updates|publisher=Anime News Network|work=News|date=2001-03-27|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second season
The series garnered positive fan response internationally that resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and Bandai Visual. Season two premiered on Japan's [[SUN-TV]] on January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later in the [[Adult Swim]] lineup.&lt;ref name=&quot;konaka&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;comiccon&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-08-04/comic-con-adult-swim | title = Comic-con Adult Swim News | date = 2002-08-04 | accessdate = 2006-11-18 | publisher = Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season was scripted by Chiaki Konaka with input from the American producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;konaka&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;askjohn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animenation.net/blog/2008/05/13/ask-john-how-much-influence-do-americans-have-in-anime-co-productions/ | title = Ask John: How Much Influence do Americans Have in Anime Co-Productions? |date = 2008-05-13 | accessdate= 2008-05-13 | publisher = [[Anime Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the 13 episodes of season two, Cartoon Network had an [[Option (films)|option]] for 26 additional episodes to be written by Konaka,&lt;ref name=&quot;moreBigO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-06-09/more-big-o | title = More Big O | accessdate = 2006-12-03 | date = 2003-06-09 | publisher = Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Jason DeMarco, executive producer for season two, the middling ratings and DVD sales in the United States and Japan have made it impossible for further episodes to be produced.&lt;ref name = &quot;askAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adultswim.com/williams/askas/kim.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930211715/http://www.adultswim.com/williams/askas/kim.html | archivedate = 2007-09-30 | title = Ask Kim Manning -- And what is up with ''Big O'' Season 3?| accessdate = 2006-12-03 | publisher = [[Adult Swim]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
''The Big O'' was scored by ''[[Geidai]]'' alumnus [[Toshihiko Sahashi]]. His composition is richly symphonic and [[classical music|classical]], with a number of pieces delving into [[electronica]] and [[jazz]].&lt;ref name = &quot;theEX-OST&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ex.org/5.4/33-cd_big-o.html | title = ''The Big-O'' Original Sound Score | last = McCarter | first = Charles | accessdate = 2006-12-15 | publisher = EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chosen because of his &quot;frightening amount of musical knowledge about TV dramas overseas,&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;AnimePlay&quot;/&gt; Sahashi integrates musical homages into the soundtrack. The background music draws from ''[[film noir]]'', [[spy film]]s and [[sci-fi]] television series like ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. The battle themes are reminiscent of [[Akira Ifukube]]'s compositions for the ''[[Godzilla]]'' series.&lt;ref name = &quot;influences&quot;/&gt;

The first opening theme is the [[Queen (band)|Queen]]-influenced &quot;Big-O!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theEX-Single&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ex.org/5.3/51-cd_bigo.html | title = The Big O! CD Single | accessdate = 2006-12-08 | last = McCarter | first = Charles | date = |publisher = EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed, arranged and performed by Rui Nagai, the song resembles [[Flash (song)|the theme]] to the ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' film. The second opening theme is &quot;Respect,&quot; composed by Sahashi. The track is an homage to the music of [[Gerry Anderson]]'s ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'', composed by [[Barry Gray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ACen03&quot;/&gt; In 2007, Rui Nagai composed &quot;Big-O! Show Must Go On,&quot; a 1960s [[hard rock]] piece, for [[Animax]]'s reruns of the show. The closing theme is the slow love ballad &quot;And Forever,&quot; written by Chie and composed by Ken Shima. The duet is performed by Robbie Danzie and Naoki Takao.

Along with Sahashi's original compositions, the soundtrack features [[Chopin]]'s [[Preludes (Chopin)|Prelude]] No. 15 and a jazz saxophone rendition of &quot;[[Jingle Bells]].&quot; The complete score was released in two volumes by [[Victor Entertainment]].

=== Adaptations ===
{{See also|List of The Big O chapters}}
''The Big O'' was conceived as a [[media franchise]].&lt;ref name = &quot;birth&quot;/&gt; To this effect, [[Hajime Yatate|Sunrise]] requested a manga be produced along with the animated series. ''The Big O'' manga started serialization in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Magazine Z]]'' on July 1999, three months before the anime premiere. Authored by Hitoshi Ariga, the manga uses Keiichi Sato's concept designs in an all-new story. The series ended on October 2001. The issues were later collected in six [[tankōbon|volumes]]. The English version of the manga is published by [[Viz Media]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ariga&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ancient.co.jp/~ariga/bigo/index.html | title = ''The Big O'' section at Hitoshi Ariga's site | accessdate = 2007-08-01 | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation to the broadcast of the second season, a new manga series was published. {{nihongo|''Lost Memory''|ロストメモリー|Rosuto Memorī}}, authored by Hitoshi Ariga. ''Lost Memory'' takes place between volumes five and six of the original manga. The issues were serialized in ''Magazine Z'' from November 2002 to September 2003 and were collected in two volumes.&lt;ref name = &quot;ariga&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|''Paradigm Noise''|パラダイム・ノイズ|Paradaimu Noizu}}, a novel by Yuki Taniguchi, was released 16 July 2003 by [[Tokuma Shoten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=THEビッグオー ラダイム・ノイズ|trans_title=The Big O: Noise Paradign|publisher=Tokuma Shoten|location=Japan|first=Yuki|last=Taniguchi|isbn=4-19-861708-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
''The Big O'' is the brainchild of Keiichi Sato and Kazuyoshi Katayama, an [[homage]] to the shows they grew up with. The show references the works of [[Gerry Anderson]] and [[ITC Entertainment]], the [[Toei Superheroes|superhero shows]] produced by the [[Toei Company]] and &quot;[[Wiktionary:old school|old school]]&quot; [[super robot]]s. The series is done in the style of ''[[film noir]]'' and [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] and combines the feel of a detective show with the [[mecha anime|giant robot]] genre.&lt;ref name = &quot;AnimePlay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;March&quot;/&gt;

=== Style ===
''[[Film noir]]'' is a stylistic approach to genre films forged in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era detective and gangster films and [[hard-boiled]] [[detective stories]] which were a staple of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Silver-noir&quot;&gt;[[Alain Silver|Silver, A.]] &amp; Ursini, J. &quot;What is 'Noir'?&quot; In ''Film Noir''. Los Angeles, CA: Taschen Books. ISBN 3-8228-2261-2&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Big O'' shares much of its themes, diction, archetypes and visual iconography with ''film noirs'' of the 1940s like ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946).&lt;ref name=&quot;animeAU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anime.org.au/main/staticpages/index.php?page=20040918172616306 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807004721/http://www.anime.org.au/main/staticpages/index.php?page=20040918172616306 |archivedate = 2007-08-07 |title = The Big O | publisher = anime and manga for Australia | accessdate = 2008-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shadowcasting (Big O).JPG|thumb|240px|The shadows of [[Venetian blinds]] cast upon the hero, a signature visual of ''[[film noir]]''.]]
[[Low-key lighting]] schemes mark most ''noirs''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Silver-noir&quot;/&gt; The series incorporates the use of long dark shadows in the tradition of ''[[chiaroscuro]]'' and [[tenebrism]]. ''Film noir'' is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger's [[low-angle shot|low shot]] introduction in the first episode. ''Noir'' cinematographers favoured this angle because it made characters almost rise from the ground, giving them dramatic girth and symbolic overtones. Other disorientating devices like [[dutch angle]]s, mirror reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.&lt;ref name = &quot;influences&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;animeAU&quot;/&gt;

The [[List of The Big O characters|characters of ''The Big O'']] fit the ''noir'' and pulp fiction [[archetype]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Silver-noir&quot;/&gt; Roger Smith is a protagonist in the mold of [[Raymond Chandler|Chandler]]'s [[Philip Marlowe]] or [[Dashiell Hammett|Hammett]]'s [[Sam Spade]].&lt;ref name = &quot;March&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/month-in-review/2002-04-01 | title = The Month in Review - March 2002 | last = Green | first = Scott | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = 2002-04-01 | accessdate = 2008-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;jump&quot;/&gt; He is canny and cynical, a disillusioned cop-turned-[[negotiator]] whose job has more in common with detective-style work than negotiating. Big Ear is Roger's street informant and Dan Dastun is the friend on the police force. The recurring Beck is the imaginative thug compelled by delusions of grandeur while Angel fills the role of the ''[[femme fatale]]''. Minor characters include crooked cops, corrupt business men and deranged scientists.&lt;ref name = &quot;influences&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.animeland.com/index.php?rub=articles&amp;id=198 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |title = ''The Big O'', un animé sous influence | last = Penedo | first = Nicolas |publisher = AnimeLand | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Noir'' characters often wisecrack and speak in [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Silver-noir&quot;/&gt; The dialogue in the series is recognized for its witty, wry sense of humor. The characters come off as charming and exchange banter not often heard in anime series, as the dialogue has tendency to be straightforward. The plot is moved along by Roger's [[voice-over]] [[First-person narrative|narration]], a device used in ''film noir'' to place the viewer in the mind of the protagonist so it can intimately experience the character's angst and partly identify with the narrator.&lt;ref name = &quot;AnimePlay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNpreview&quot;/&gt;

The urban landscape, [[Paradigm City]], is the perfect ''noir'' milieu.&lt;ref name = &quot;Silver-noir&quot;/&gt; The tall buildings and giant domes create a sense of [[claustrophobia]] and [[paranoia]] characteristic of the style.&lt;ref name=&quot;onDVD1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vision&quot;/&gt; The rural landscape, Ailesberry Farm, contrasts Paradigm City. ''Noir'' protagonists often look for sanctuary in such settings but, as seen in Act:23, they just as likely end up becoming a killing ground.&lt;ref name = &quot;influences&quot;/&gt; The series score is representative of its setting. While no classic ''noir'' possesses a [[jazz]] score, the music could be heard in nightclubs within the films.&lt;ref name=&quot;jazznoir&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sfjazz.org/news/2006/2006_may_17.html | accessdate = 2006-11-04 |title = Interview with Eddie Muller | date = 2006-05-17 | publisher = SFJAZZ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061001033635/http://www.sfjazz.org/news/2006/2006_may_17.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[leitmotif|recurring]] {{audio|Roger's Theme (Big O).ogg|Roger's Theme}}, a lone saxophone accompaniment to the protagonist's narration, best exemplifies the ''noir'' stylings of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;animeAU&quot;/&gt;

[[Amnesia]] is a common [[plot device]] in ''film noir''. Because most of these stories focused on a character proving his innocence, authors up the ante by making him an amnesiac, unable to prove his innocence even to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;holiday&quot;&gt;[[Terrence Rafferty|Rafferty, T]]. (2 November 2003) The Last Word in Alienation: I Just Don't Remember. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Big O'' goes further, by removing the memories of the whole population. The convoluted past is told through the use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. In most ''noirs'', the past is tangible and menacing. The characters are often trying to escape some trauma or crime tied to the Event, and confronting it becomes their only chance at redemption.&lt;ref name = &quot;Silver-noir&quot;/&gt;

=== Influences ===
Before ''The Big O'', [[Sunrise Studios]] was a subcontractor for [[Warner Bros. Animation]]'s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'',&lt;ref name = &quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Clements | first = Jonathan | coauthors = Helen McCarthy  |title= The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |publisher= Stone Bridge Press | location =  Berkley, CA | year = 2001 |isbn = 1-88-065664-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For detail on which episodes Sunrise worked on, see [http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/crewcredits/animation.php The World's Finest].&lt;/ref&gt; one of the series' influences.&lt;ref name = &quot;birth&quot;/&gt; 

Roger Smith is a [[pastiche]] of the [[Bruce Wayne]] [[persona]] and the Batman. The character design resembles Wayne, complete with slicked-back hair and double-breasted business suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;theEX&quot;/&gt; Like Bruce, Roger prides himself in being a rich playboy to the extent that one of his household's rules is only women may be let into his mansion without his permission.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNpreview&quot;/&gt; Like Batman, Roger Smith carries a no-gun policy, albeit more flexible. Unlike the personal motives of the Batman, Roger enforces this rule for &quot;it's all part of being a gentleman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Missing Cat | series = The Big O | credits = [[Keiichi Hasegawa]] (writer) | network = [[WOWOW]] | airdate = 1999-12-01 | number = 08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Roger's gadgetry is the Griffon, a large, black hi-tech [[sedan (car)|sedan]] comparable to the [[Batmobile]], a grappling cable that shoots out his wristwatch and the giant robot that Angel calls &quot;Roger's [[alter ego]].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;influences&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Negotiations with the Dead | series = The Big O | credits = [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] (writer) | network = [[Sun Television (Japan)|Sun Television]] | airdate = 2003-01-09 | number = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big O'''s cast of [[supporting character]]s includes Norman, Roger's faithful mechanically-inclined butler who fills the role of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; R. Dorothy Wayneright, who plays the role of the sidekick; and Dan Dastun, a good honest cop who, like [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], is both a friend to the hero and greatly respected by his comrades.&lt;ref name = &quot;influences&quot;/&gt;

The other major influence is [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama]]'s ''[[Giant Robo]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNpreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Before working on ''The Big O'', Kazuyoshi Katayama and other animators worked with [[Yasuhiro Imagawa]] on ''[[Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''.

Like Giant Robo, the [[megadeus]]es of ''Big O'' are metal behemoths. The designs are strange and &quot;more macho than practical,&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;theEX&quot;/&gt; sporting big stovepipe arms and exposed rivets. Unlike the giants of other mecha series, the megadeuses do not exhibit ninja-like speed nor grace. Instead, the robots are armed with &quot;old school&quot; weaponry such as [[missile]]s, [[piston]] powered punches, [[machine gun]]s and [[laser]] [[cannon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;herorev2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.japanhero.com/super%20robot%20reviews/big_o-2.htm | title = Super Robot Review: ''The Big O'' | accessdate = 2006-11-23 | last = Hayward | first = Keith | publisher = Japan Hero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
;Companion book
''The Big O Visual: The official companion to the TV series'' (ISBN 4-575-29579-5) was published by Futabasha in 2003. The book contains full-color artwork, character bios and [[concept art]], mecha sketches, video/LD/DVD jacket illustrations, history on the making of The Big O, staff interviews, &quot;Roger's Monologues&quot; comic strip and the original script for the final episode of the series.

;Audio drama
&quot;Walking Together On The Yellow Brick Road&quot; was released by [[Victor Entertainment]] on 21 September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo-online.co.jp/ds/3187649/|title=THE ビッグオー ORIGINAL CD DRAMA THEATER &quot;WALKING TOGETHER ON THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD|trans_title=The Big O Original CD Drama Theater &quot;Walking Together on the Yellow Brick Road|publisher=GeoOnline|accessdate=2009-08-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[drama CD]] was written by series head writer [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] and featured the series' voice cast.

;Video games
The first season of Big O is featured in ''[[Super Robot Wars D]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The series, including its second season is also featured in Super Robot Wars Z, released in 2008.

;Toys and model kits
[[Bandai]] released a non-scale model kit of the Big O in 2000. Though it was an easy snap-together kit, it required painting, as all of the parts (except the clear orange crown and canopy) were molded in dark gray. The kit included springs that enabled the slide-action Side Piles on the forearms to simulate the Megadeus' Sudden Impact maneuver. Also included was an unpainted Roger Smith figure.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] figures of the Big O and Big Duo (Schwarzwald's Megadeus) were sold by Bandai in North America. Each came with non-poseable figures of Roger, Dorothy and Angel. Mini-figure sets were also offered in Japan, featuring the Big O (standard and attack modes), Roger, Dorothy &amp; Norman, Griffon (Roger's car), Dorothy-1 (Big O's first opponent), Schwarzwald and Big Duo.

In 2009, Bandai released a plastic/diecast figure of the Big O under their ''Soul of Chogokin'' line. The figure has the same features as the model kit, but with added detail and accessories. Its design was closely supervised by original designer Keiichi Sato.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hlj.com/product/BAN956922 HobbyLink Japan - Soul of Chogokin The Big O]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Big O'' premiered on 13 October 1999. The show was not a hit in its native Japan, rather it was reduced from an outlined 26 episodes to 13 episodes. Western audiences were more receptive and the series achieved the success its creators were looking for.&lt;ref name=&quot;konaka&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;verdict-II-1&quot;/&gt; In an interview with [[AnimePlay]], Keiichi Sato said &quot;This is exactly as we had planned&quot;, referring to the success overseas.&lt;ref name = &quot;AnimePlay&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shimura |first= Shinichi |title= Anime rebel with a cause: ''The Big O'''s Keiichi Sato | journal= [[AnimePlay]] | volume = 5 | year = 2004  | pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[IBM PC compatible]] computers, the '''basic input/output system (BIOS)''', also known as the '''System BIOS''' or '''[[read-only memory|ROM]] BIOS''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbaɪ.oʊs|pron}}), is a [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] defining a [[firmware]] interface.&lt;ref name = &quot;pcguidedefinition&quot;&gt;[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/bios/index.htm The PC Guide - System BIOS]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AwardBIOS CMOS Setup Utility.png|thumb|right|Phoenix AwardBIOS CMOS ([[Nonvolatile BIOS memory|non-volatile memory]]) Setup utility on a standard PC]] 

The BIOS software is built into the [[Personal computer|PC]], and is the first code run by a PC when powered on ('boot firmware'). The primary function of the BIOS is to set up the hardware and load and start an [[operating system]]. When the PC starts up, the first job for the BIOS is to initialize and identify system devices such as the [[video display card]], [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computer)|mouse]], [[hard disk drive]], [[optical disc drive]] and other [[Computer hardware|hardware]]. The BIOS then locates software held on a peripheral device (designated as a 'boot device'), such as a hard disk or a CD/DVD, and loads and executes that software, giving it control of the PC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bios1.htm HowStuffWorks: What BIOS Does].&lt;/ref&gt;
This process is known as ''booting'', or booting up, which is short for [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]].

BIOS software is stored on a [[non-volatile]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip built into the system on the [[motherboard]]. The BIOS software is specifically designed to work with the particular type of system in question, including having a knowledge of the workings of various devices that make up the complementary chipset of the system. In modern computer systems, the [[EEPROM|BIOS chip's contents can be rewritten]], allowing BIOS software to be upgraded. 

A BIOS will also have a [[user interface]] (or UI for short). Typically this is a menu system accessed by pressing a certain key on the keyboard when the PC starts. In the BIOS UI, a user can:
* configure hardware
* set the system clock
* enable or disable system components
* select which devices are eligible to be a potential boot device
* set various password prompts, such as a password for securing access to the BIOS UI functions itself and preventing malicious users from booting the system from unauthorized peripheral devices.

The BIOS provides a small library of basic input/output functions used to operate and control the peripherals such as the keyboard, text display functions and so forth, and these software library functions are callable by external software. In the IBM PC and AT, certain peripheral cards such as hard-drive controllers and video display adapters carried their own BIOS extension [[Option ROM]], which provided additional functionality. [[Operating system]]s and executive software, designed to supersede this basic firmware functionality, will provide replacement software interfaces to applications. 

BIOS is primarily associated with the 16-bit, 32-bit, and the beginning of the 64-bit architecture eras, while [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] is used for some newer 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Today BIOS is primarily used for booting a system and for video initialization (in [[X.Org Server|X.org]]); but otherwise is not used during the ordinary running of a system, while in early systems (particularly in the 16-bit era), BIOS was used for hardware access – operating systems (notably [[MS-DOS]]) would call the BIOS rather than directly accessing the hardware. In the 32-bit era and later, operating systems instead generally directly accessed the hardware using their own [[device driver]]s.

The [[#Changing role of the BIOS|role of the BIOS]] has changed over time; today BIOS is a legacy system, superseded by the more complex [[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI), but BIOS remains in widespread use, and EFI booting has only been supported in [[Microsoft]]'s [[operating system]] products supporting [[GUID Partition Table|GPT]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/gpt_faq.mspx Windows and GPT FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linux kernel]]s 2.6.1 and greater builds &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/technology/efi/ Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and Unified EFI (UEFI)]&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, the distinction between BIOS and EFI is rarely made in terminology by the average computer user, making BIOS a catch-all term for both systems.

== Terminology ==
The term first appeared in the [[CP/M]] operating system, describing the part of CP/M loaded during boot time that interfaced directly with the [[Computer hardware|hardware]] (CP/M machines usually had only a simple [[boot loader]] in their [[Read-only memory|ROM]]). Most versions of [[DOS]] have a file called &quot;[[IBMBIO.COM]]&quot; or &quot;[[IO.SYS]]&quot; that is analogous to the CP/M BIOS.

Among other classes of computers, the generic terms ''[[boot monitor]]'', ''[[boot loader]]'' or ''[[Booting|boot ROM]]'' were commonly used. Some Sun and PowerPC-based computers use [[Open Firmware]] for this purpose. There are a few alternatives for Legacy BIOS in the x86 world: [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], [[Open Firmware]] (used on the [[OLPC XO-1]]) and [[coreboot]].

==IBM PC-compatible BIOS chips ==
In principle, the BIOS in ROM was customized to the particular manufacturer's hardware, allowing low-level services (such as reading a keystroke or writing a sector of data to diskette) to be provided in a standardized way to the operating system.&amp;nbsp; For example, an IBM PC might have had either a monochrome or a color display adapter, using different display memory addresses and hardware - but the BIOS service to print a character on the screen in [[text mode]] would be the same.

[[Image:Phoenix bios.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Phoenix Technologies|PhoenixBIOS]] D686.&amp;nbsp; This BIOS chip is housed in a [[Plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]] package, which is, in turn, plugged into a PLCC socket.]] 

Prior to the early 1990s, '''BIOS'''es were stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] or [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] chips, which could not be altered by users.&amp;nbsp; As its complexity and need for updates grew, and re-programmable parts became more available, BIOS firmware was most commonly stored on [[EEPROM]] or [[flash memory]] devices.&amp;nbsp; According to Robert Braver, the president of the BIOS manufacturer Micro Firmware, '''Flash BIOS''' chips became common around 1995 because the electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) chips are cheaper and easier to program than standard erasable PROM ([[EPROM]]) chips.&amp;nbsp; EPROM chips may be erased by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light, which accessed the chip via the window.&amp;nbsp; Chip manufacturers use EPROM programmers (blasters) to program EPROM chips.&amp;nbsp; Electrically erasable (EEPROM) chips allow BIOS reprogramming using higher-than-normal voltage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F1997%2Fjun97%2F060997%2F060997.asp Decoding RAM &amp; ROM ].&quot; ''[[Smart Computing]]''.&amp;nbsp; June 1997.&amp;nbsp; Volume 8, Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; BIOS versions are upgraded to take advantage of newer versions of hardware and to correct bugs in previous revisions of BIOSes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F1996%2Fmar96%2F96n0324%2F96n0324.asp Upgrading Your Flash BIOS For Plug And Play].&quot; ''[[Smart Computing]]''.&amp;nbsp; March 1996.&amp;nbsp; Volume 7, Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the IBM AT, PCs supported a hardware clock settable through BIOS.&amp;nbsp; It had a century bit which allowed for manually changing the century when the year 2000 happened.&amp;nbsp; Most BIOS revisions created in 1995 and nearly all BIOS revisions in 1997 supported [[Y2K bug|the year 2000]] by setting the century bit automatically when the clock rolled past midnight, December 31, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/g0704/41u6/41u6.asp&amp;guid= Time To Check BIOS].&quot; ''[[Smart Computing]]''.&amp;nbsp; April 1999.&amp;nbsp; Volume 7, Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flash chips were attached to the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA bus]].&amp;nbsp; Starting in 1997, the BIOS flash moved to the [[Low Pin Count|LPC]] bus, a functional replacement for ISA, following a new standard implementation known as &quot;firmware hub&quot; (FWH).&amp;nbsp; In 2006, the first systems supporting a [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI) appeared, and the BIOS flash moved again.

The size of the BIOS, and the capacities of the ROM, EEPROM and other media it may be stored on, has increased over time as new features have been added to the code; BIOS versions now exist with sizes up to 16 megabytes. Some modern motherboards are including even bigger NAND [[flash memory]] ICs on board which are capable of storing whole compact operating system distribution like some [[Linux distribution]]s. For example, some recent ASUS motherboards included [[SplashTop]] Linux embedded into their NAND flash memory ICs.

== Flashing the BIOS ==
In modern PCs the BIOS is stored in [[EEPROM|rewritable memory]], allowing the contents to be replaced or 'rewritten'. This rewriting of the contents is sometimes termed '''flashing'''. This can be done by a special program, usually provided by the system's manufacturer, or at [[Power-on self-test|POST]], with a BIOS image in a hard drive or [[USB flash drive]]. A file containing such contents is sometimes termed 'a BIOS image'. A BIOS might be reflashed in order to upgrade to a newer version to fix bugs or provide improved performance or to support newer hardware, or a reflashing operation might be needed to fix a damaged BIOS.
A BIOS may also be &quot;flashed&quot; by putting the file on the root of a USB drive and booting.

== BIOS chip vulnerabilities ==
[[File:AMIBIOSIntel CPU uCode Error.jpg|thumb|An [[American Megatrends]] BIOS registering the “[[Intel]] CPU uCode Error” while doing [[Power-on self-test|POST]], most likely a problem with the POST.]]

[[EEPROM]] chips are advantageous because they can be easily updated by the user; hardware manufacturers frequently issue BIOS updates to upgrade their products, improve compatibility and remove [[Software bug|bugs]]. However, this advantage had the risk that an improperly executed or aborted BIOS update could render the computer or device unusable. To avoid these situations, more recent BIOSes use a &quot;boot block&quot;; a portion of the BIOS which runs first and must be updated separately. This code verifies if the rest of the BIOS is intact (using [[Hash function|hash]] [[checksum]]s or other methods) before transferring control to it. If the boot block detects any corruption in the main BIOS, it will typically warn the user that a recovery process must be initiated by booting from [[removable media]] (floppy, CD or USB memory) so the user can try flashing the BIOS again. Some [[motherboard]]s have a ''backup'' BIOS (sometimes referred to as DualBIOS boards) to recover from BIOS corruptions.

== Overclocking ==
Some BIOS chips allow [[overclocking]], an action in which the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] is adjusted to a higher [[clock rate]] than its factory preset.  Overclocking may, however, seriously compromise system reliability in insufficiently cooled computers and generally shorten component lifespan. Overclocking, incorrectly performed, may also cause component temperatures to rise so quickly that they destroy themselves.

== Virus attacks ==
There are at least three known BIOS attack viruses, two of which were for demonstration purposes.

=== CIH ===
{{Main|CIH (computer virus)}}
The first was a virus which was able to erase Flash ROM BIOS content, rendering computer systems unstable. [[CIH (computer virus)|CIH]], also known as &quot;[[Chernobyl Virus]]&quot;, appeared for the first time in mid-1998 and became active in April 1999. It affected systems' BIOS's and often they could not be fixed on their own since they were no longer able to boot at all. To repair this, flash ROM IC had to be removed from the motherboard to be reprogrammed elsewhere. Damage from CIH was possible since the virus was specifically targeted at the then widespread Intel i430TX motherboard chipset, and the most common operating systems of the time were based on the [[Windows 9x]] family allowing direct hardware access to all programs. 

Modern systems are not vulnerable to CIH because of a variety of chipsets being used which are incompatible with the Intel i430TX chipset, and also other flash ROM IC types. There is also extra protection from accidental BIOS rewrites in the form of boot blocks which are protected from accidental overwrite or dual and quad BIOS equipped systems which may, in the event of a crash, use a backup BIOS. Also, all modern operating systems like [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Windows NT]]-based Windows OS like [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]] and newer, do not allow user-mode programs to have direct hardware access. As a result, as of 2008, CIH has become essentially harmless, at worst causing annoyance by infecting executable files and triggering alerts from antivirus software. Other BIOS viruses remain possible, however;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.com/news/bios-virus-rootkit-security-backdoor,7400.html New BIOS Virus Withstands HDD Wipes], March 27, 2009 by Marcus Yam - Tom's Hardware US&lt;/ref&gt; since Windows users without Windows Vista/7's UAC run all applications with administrative privileges, a modern CIH-like virus could in principle still gain access to hardware.

=== Black Hat 2006 ===
The second one was a technique presented by John Heasman, principal security consultant for UK-based Next-Generation Security Software at the Black Hat Security Conference (2006), where he showed how to elevate privileges and read physical memory, using malicious procedures that replaced normal [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] functions stored in flash memory.

=== Persistent BIOS infection ===
The third one, known as &quot;Persistent BIOS infection&quot;, was a method presented in CanSecWest Security Conference (Vancouver, 2009) and SyScan Security Conference (Singapore, 2009) where researchers Anibal Sacco &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alfredo Ortega, from Core Security Technologies, demonstrated insertion of malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS, allowing for nearly full control of the PC at every start-up, even before the operating system is booted.

The proof-of-concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation, but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures. Thus, it requires physical access to the machine or for the user on the operating system to be root. Despite this, however, researchers underline the profound implications of their discovery: “We can patch a driver to drop a fully working [[rootkit]]. We even have a little code that can remove or disable antivirus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Firmware on adapter cards ==
A computer system can contain several BIOS firmware chips. The motherboard BIOS typically contains code to access hardware components absolutely necessary for bootstrapping the system, such as the keyboard (either [[PS/2]] or on a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] human interface device), and storage ([[floppy drive]]s, if available, and IDE or SATA hard disk controllers). In addition, plug-in adapter cards such as [[SCSI]], [[RAID]], [[network interface card]]s, and video boards often include their own BIOS (e.g. [[Video BIOS]]), complementing or replacing the system BIOS code for the given component. (This code is generally referred to as an [[option ROM]]). Even devices built into the motherboard can behave in this way; their option ROMs can be stored as separate code on the main BIOS flash chip, and upgraded either in tandem with, or separately from, the main BIOS.

An add-in card usually only requires an option ROM if it:
* Needs to be used before the operating system can be loaded (usually this means it is required in the bootstrapping process), and
* Is too sophisticated or specific a device to be handled by the main BIOS

Older [[Personal computer|PC]] [[operating system]]s, such as [[MS-DOS]] (including all DOS-based versions of Microsoft Windows), and early-stage bootloaders, may continue to use the BIOS for input and output. However, the restrictions of the BIOS environment means that modern OSes will almost always use their own [[device driver]]s to directly control the hardware. Generally, these device drivers only use BIOS and option ROM calls for very specific (non-performance-critical) tasks, such as preliminary device initialization.

In order to discover memory-mapped [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] option ROMs during the boot process, PC BIOS implementations scan real memory from &lt;code&gt;0xC0000&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0xF0000&lt;/code&gt; on 2 [[KiB]] boundaries, looking for a ROM ''signature'': &lt;code&gt;0xAA55&lt;/code&gt; (0x55 followed by 0xAA, since the [[x86]] architecture is [[little-endian]]). In a valid expansion ROM, this signature is immediately followed by a single byte indicating the number of 512-byte blocks it occupies in real memory. The next byte contains an offset describing the option ROM's [[entry point]], to which the BIOS immediately transfers control. At this point, the expansion ROM code takes over, using BIOS services to register [[interrupt vector]]s for use by post-boot applications, provide a user configuration interface, or display diagnostic information.

There are many methods and utilities for examining the contents of various motherboard BIOS and expansion ROMs, such as Microsoft [[DEBUG (DOS Command)|DEBUG]] or the Unix [[dd (Unix)|dd]].

==BIOS boot specification==
If the expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots (such as from a network device or a SCSI adapter for which the BIOS has no driver code), it can use the ''BIOS Boot Specification'' (BBS) [[Application programming interface|API]] to register its ability to do so. Once the expansion ROMs have registered using the BBS APIs, the user can select among the available boot options from within the BIOS's user interface. This is why most BBS compliant PC BIOS implementations will not allow the user to enter the BIOS's user interface until the expansion ROMs have finished executing and registering themselves with the BBS API.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Changing role of the BIOS==
Some [[operating system]]s, for example [[MS-DOS]], rely on the BIOS to carry out most input/output tasks within the PC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F1994%2Fjuly94%2Fpcn0713%2Fpcn0713.asp Smart Computing Article - What Is The BIOS?] - Computing Basics July 1994 • Vol.5 Issue 7&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of technical reasons makes it inefficient for some recent operating systems written for [[32-bit]] CPUs such as [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] to invoke the BIOS directly. Larger, more powerful, servers and workstations using [[PowerPC]] or [[SPARC]] CPUs by several manufacturers developed a platform-independent [[Open Firmware]] (IEEE-1275), based on the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] programming language. It is included with Sun's SPARC computers, IBM's [[RS/6000]] line, and other PowerPC [[Common Hardware Reference Platform|CHRP]] motherboards. Later x86-based personal computer operating systems, like Windows NT, use their own, native drivers which also makes it much easier to extend support to new hardware, while the BIOS still relies on a legacy 16-bit [[real mode]] runtime interface.

There was a similar transition for the Apple Macintosh, where the system software originally relied heavily on the [[Macintosh Toolbox|ToolBox]]—a set of drivers and other useful routines stored in ROM based on Motorola's 680x0 CPUs. These Apple ROMs were replaced by Open Firmware in the [[PowerPC]] [[Macintosh]], then [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] in Intel Macintosh computers.

Later BIOS took on more complex functions, by way of interfaces such as [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]]; these functions include [[power management]], [[hot swapping]], thermal management.  To quote [[Linus Torvalds]],
the task of BIOS is &quot;just load the [[operating system|OS]] and get the hell out of there&quot;. However BIOS limitations (16-bit processor mode, only 1 MiB addressable space, PC AT hardware dependencies, etc.) were seen as clearly unacceptable for the newer computer platforms. [[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) is a specification which replaces the runtime interface of the legacy BIOS. Initially written for the Itanium architecture, EFI is now available for [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] platforms; the specification development is driven by The [[Unified EFI Forum]], an industry [[Special Interest Group]].  

Linux has supported EFI via the [[elilo]] and [[GNU GRUB]] boot loaders. The open source community increased their effort to develop a replacement for proprietary BIOSes and their future incarnations with an open sourced counterpart through the [[coreboot]] and [[OpenBIOS]]/[[Open Firmware]] projects. [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] provided product specifications for some chipsets, and [[Google]] is sponsoring the project. [[Motherboard]] manufacturer [[Tyan]] offers [[coreboot]] next to the standard BIOS with their [[Opteron]] line of motherboards. [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] and [[Gigabyte Technology]] have followed suit with the MSI K9ND MS-9282 and MSI K9SD MS-9185 resp. the M57SLI-S4 models.

Some BIOSes contain a &quot;SLIC&quot; (Software Licensing Information Code), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the manufacturer, for example [[Dell]]. This SLIC is inserted in the ACPI table and contains no active code. Computer manufacturers that distribute OEM versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft application software can use the SLIC to authenticate licensing to the OEM Windows Installation disk and/or system [[recovery disc]] containing Windows software. Systems having a SLIC can be preactivated with an OEM product key, and they verify an XML formatted OEM certificate against the SLIC in the BIOS as a means of self-activating (see [[System Locked Preinstallation]]). If a user performs a fresh install of Windows, they will need to have possession of both the OEM key and the digital certificate for their SLIC in order to bypass activation; in practice this is extremely unlikely and hence the only real way this can be achieved is if the user performs a restore using a pre-customised image provided by the OEM.

Recent [[Intel]] processors (P6 and P7) have reprogrammable [[microcode]]. The BIOS may contain patches to the processor code to allow errors in the initial processor code to be fixed, updating the processor microcode each time the system is powered up. Otherwise, an expensive processor swap would be required.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Mueller, ''Upgrading and repairing PCs 15th edition'', Que Publishing, 2003 ISBN 0789729741, pages 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] became an expensive fiasco for Intel that required a [[product recall]] because the original Pentium did not have patchable microcode.

==The BIOS business==
The vast majority of PC motherboard suppliers license a BIOS &quot;core&quot; and toolkit from a commercial third-party, known as an &quot;independent BIOS vendor&quot; or IBV. The motherboard manufacturer then customizes this BIOS to suit its own hardware. For this reason, updated BIOSes are normally obtained directly from the motherboard manufacturer.

Major BIOS vendors include [[American Megatrends]] (AMI), [[Insyde Software]], [[Phoenix Technologies]] and [[Byosoft]]. Former vendors include [[Award Software]] and [[Microid Research]] which were acquired by [[Phoenix Technologies]] in 1998. Phoenix has now phased out the Award Brand name. [[General Software]], which was also acquired by Phoenix in 2007, sold BIOS for Intel processor based embedded systems.

A '''Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC)''' is a [[state of matter]] of a dilute gas of weakly interacting [[boson]]s confined in an external [[potential]] and cooled to [[temperature]]s very near [[absolute zero]] ({{val|0|u=K}} or {{val|-273.15|u=°C}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;).  Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest [[quantum state]] of the external potential, at which point [[quantum]] effects become apparent on a [[macroscopic scale]]. {{Examples|date=March 2011}}

This state of matter was first predicted by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the [[quantum statistics]] of light quanta (now called [[photon]]s). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper himself from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, &quot;Einstein: The Life and Times&quot; (Avon Books, 1971) pp.408–9 ISBN 038001159X&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy years later, the first gaseous [[condensate]] was produced by [[Eric Allin Cornell|Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] in 1995 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]-[[JILA]] lab, using a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms cooled to 170 [[kelvin|nanokelvin]] (nK) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = New State of Matter Seen Near Absolute Zero|url=http://physics.nist.gov/News/Update/950724.html|publisher=NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{val|1.7|e=-7|u=K}}).

== Theory ==

The slowing of atoms by the use of cooling apparatus produces a singular quantum state known as a '''Bose condensate''' or '''Bose–Einstein condensate'''. This phenomenon was predicted in 1925 by generalizing Satyendra Nath Bose's work on the [[statistical mechanics]] of (massless) [[photon]]s to (massive) atoms. (The Einstein manuscript, once believed to be lost, was found in a library at [[Leiden University]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/Einstein_archive/ |title=Leiden University Einstein archive |publisher=Lorentz.leidenuniv.nl |date=1920-10-27 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The result of the efforts of Bose and Einstein is the concept of a [[Bose gas]], governed by [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], which describes the statistical distribution of [[identical particles]] with [[integer]] [[spin (physics)|spin]], now known as [[bosons]]. Bosonic particles, which include the photon as well as atoms such as [[helium|helium-4]], are allowed to share quantum states with each other. Einstein
demonstrated that cooling bosonic atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or &quot;condense&quot;) into the lowest accessible quantum state, resulting in a new form of matter.

This transition occurs below a critical temperature, which for a uniform [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] gas consisting of non-interacting particles with no apparent internal degrees of freedom is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T_c=\left(\frac{n}{\zeta(3/2)}\right)^{2/3}\frac{2\pi \hbar^2}{ m k_B} \approx 3.31 \ \frac{\hbar^2 n^{2/3}}{m k_B} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

=== Einstein'''s'' argument ===

Consider a collection of ''N'' noninteracting particles, which can each be in one of two quantum states, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If the two states are equal in energy, each different configuration is equally likely.

If we can tell which particle is which, there are &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt; different configurations, since each particle can be in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; independently. In almost all of the configurations, about half the particles are in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the other half in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The balance is a statistical effect: the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally.

If the particles are indistinguishable, however, there are only ''N''+1 different configurations. If there are ''K'' particles in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''N''-''K'' particles in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Whether any particular particle is in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; cannot be determined, so each value of ''K'' determines a unique quantum state for the whole system. If all these states are equally likely, there is no statistical spreading out; it is just as likely for all the particles to sit in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as for the particles to be split half and half.

Suppose now that the energy of state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is slightly greater than the energy of state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by an amount ''E''. At temperature ''T'', a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by exp(−''E''/''T''). In the distinguishable case, the particle distribution will be biased slightly towards state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the distribution will be slightly different from half and half. But in the indistinguishable case, since there is no statistical pressure toward equal numbers, the most likely outcome is that most of the particles will collapse into state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

In the distinguishable case, for large ''N'', the fraction in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be computed. It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to ''p'' = exp(−''E''/''T'') to land tails. The probability to land heads is 1/(1+''p''), which is a smooth function of ''p'', and thus of the energy.

In the indistinguishable case, each value of ''K'' is a single state, which has its own separate Boltzmann probability. So the probability distribution is exponential:

:&lt;math&gt;\,
P(K)= C e^{-KE/T} = C p^K.
&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''N'', the normalization constant ''C'' is (1−''p''). The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state, in the limit that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{n&gt;0} C n p^n=p/(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;. It does not grow when ''N'' is large, it just approaches a constant. This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles. So a collection of enough Bose particles in thermal equilibrium will mostly be in the ground state, with only a few in any excited state, no matter how small the energy difference.

Consider now a gas of particles, which can be in different momentum states labeled &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|k\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, for high temperatures and low densities, the particles will all be in different states. In this limit the gas is classical. As the density increases or the temperature decreases, the number of accessible states per particle becomes smaller, and at some point more particles will be forced into a single state than the maximum allowed for that state by statistical weighting. From this point on, any extra particle added will go into the ground state.

To calculate the transition temperature at any density, integrate over all momentum states the expression for maximum number of excited particles  ''p''/(1−''p''):

:&lt;math&gt;\,
 N = V \int {d^3k \over (2\pi)^3} {p(k)\over 1-p(k)} = V \int {d^3k \over (2\pi)^3} {1 \over e^{k^2\over 2mT}-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\,
p(k)= e^{-k^2\over 2mT}.
&lt;/math&gt;

When the integral is evaluated with the factors of ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; and {{Unicode|ℏ}} restored by dimensional analysis, it gives the critical temperature formula of the preceding section. Therefore, this integral defines the critical temperature and particle number corresponding to the conditions of negligible chemical potential.  In [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] distribution, μ is actually still nonzero for BEC'''s''; however, μ is less than the ground state energy. Except when specifically talking about the ground state, μ can consequently be approximated for most energy or momentum states as μ ≈ 0.

=== Gross–Pitaevskii equation ===
{{Main|Gross–Pitaevskii equation}}

The state of the BEC can be described by the wavefunction of the condensate &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;. For a [[Schrödinger field|system of this nature]], &lt;math&gt;|\psi(\vec{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is &lt;math&gt;N=\int d\vec{r}|\psi(\vec{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt;

Provided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using [[mean field theory]], the energy (E) associated with the state &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;E=\int
d\vec{r}\left[\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}|\nabla\psi(\vec{r})|^2+V(\vec{r})|\psi(\vec{r})|^2+\frac{1}{2}U_0|\psi(\vec{r})|^4\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Minimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Gross-Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear [[Schrödinger equation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi(\vec{r})}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V(\vec{r})+U_0|\psi(\vec{r})|^2\right)\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
{|cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is the mass of the bosons,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,V(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is the external potential,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,U_0&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is representative of the inter-particle interactions.
|}
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

The GPE provides a good description of the behavior of BEC's and is thus often applied for theoretical analysis.

== Discovery ==

In 1938, [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa|Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[John F. Allen|John Allen]] and [[Don Misener]] discovered that [[helium-4]] became a new kind of fluid, now known as a [[superfluid]], at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the [[lambda point]]). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero [[viscosity]] (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of [[quantized vortex|quantized vortices]]. It was quickly realized that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many of the properties of superfluid helium also appear in the gaseous Bose–Einstein condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). Superfluid helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that [[helium-3]], consisting of [[fermion]]s instead of [[boson]]s, also enters a [[superfluid]] phase at low temperature, which can be explained by the formation of bosonic [[Cooper pairs]] of two atoms each (see also [[fermionic condensate]]).

The first &quot;pure&quot; Bose–Einstein condensate was created by [[Eric Cornell]], [[Carl Wieman]], and co-workers at [[JILA]] on June 5, 1995. They did this by cooling a dilute vapor consisting of approximately two thousand [[rubidium|rubidium-87]] atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of [[laser cooling]] (a technique that won its inventors [[Steven Chu]], [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], and [[William D. Phillips]] the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]) and [[magnetic evaporative cooling]]. About four months later, an independent effort led by [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] created a condensate made of [[sodium|sodium-23]]. Ketterle's condensate had about a hundred times more atoms, allowing him to obtain several important results such as the observation of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two different condensates. Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle won the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their achievements.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/cornellwieman-lecture.pdf |title=Eric A. Cornell and Carl E. Wieman&amp;nbsp;— Nobel Lecture |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A group led by Randall Hulet at Rice University announced the creation of a condensate of [[lithium]] atoms only one month following the JILA work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. C. Bradley, C. A. Sackett, J. J. Tollett, and R. G. Hulet | title=Evidence of Bose-Einstein Condensation in an Atomic Gas with Attractive Interactions | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume=75 | issue=9 | pages=1687–1690 | year=1995 | pmid=10060366 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1687+Erratum:++Phys.+Rev.+Lett.+'''79''',+1170+(1997)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lithium has attractive interactions which causes the condensate to be unstable and to collapse for all but a few atoms. Hulet and co-workers showed in a subsequent experiment that the condensate could be stabilized by the quantum pressure from trap confinement for up to about 1000 atoms.

The Bose–Einstein condensation also applies to [[quasiparticles]] in solids. A [[magnon]] in an [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] carries spin 1 and thus obeys Bose–Einstein statistics. The density of magnons is controlled by an external magnetic field, which plays the role of the magnon [[chemical potential]]. This technique provides access to a wide range of boson densities from the limit of a dilute Bose gas to that of a strongly interacting Bose liquid. A magnetic ordering observed at the point of condensation is the analog of superfluidity. In 1999 Bose condensation of magnons was demonstrated in the antiferromagnet [[Thallium|Tl]][[Copper|Cu]][[Chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=T.| last= Nikuni | title=Bose–Einstein Condensation of Dilute Magnons in TlCuCl3| journal = Physical Review Letters | volume=84 | page=5868 | year=1999 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.5868 | last2=Oshikawa | first2=M. | last3=Oosawa | first3=A. | last4=Tanaka | first4=H. | pmid=10991075 | issue=25 | bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.5868N|arxiv = cond-mat/9908118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The condensation was observed at temperatures as large as 14 K. Such a high transition temperature (relative to that of atomic gases) is due to the greater density achievable with magnons and the smaller mass (roughly equal to the mass of an electron). In 2006, condensation of magnons in [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]] was even shown at room temperature,&lt;ref name=dem&gt;{{cite journal | first= S.O. |last= Demokritov| title=Bose–Einstein condensation of quasi-equilibrium magnons at room temperature under pumping| journal = Nature|volume = 443 | pages = 430–433|year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nature05117 | pmid= 17006509 | last2= Demidov | first2= VE | last3= Dzyapko | first3= O | last4= Melkov | first4= GA | last5= Serga | first5= AA | last6= Hillebrands | first6= B | last7= Slavin | first7= AN | issue= 7110|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..430D }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the authors used pumping techniques.

== Velocity-distribution data graph ==

In the image accompanying this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate out of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]: since the atoms are trapped in a particular region of space, their velocity distribution necessarily possesses a certain minimum width. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic trapping potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This [[anisotropy]] of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the thermal distribution on the left. This famous graph served as the cover-design for 1999 textbook ''Thermal Physics'' by Ralph Baierlein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fqUU71spbZYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Thermal Physics|author=Ralph Baierlein |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0521658381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vortices ==

As in many other systems, [[vortices]] can exist in BECs. These can be created, for example, by 'stirring' the condensate with lasers, or rotating the confining trap. The vortex created will be a [[quantum vortex]]. These phenomena are allowed for by the non-linear &lt;math&gt;|\psi(\vec{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt; term in the GPE. As the vortices must have quantized [[angular momentum]] the wavefunction may have the form &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})=\phi(\rho,z)e^{i\ell\theta}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho, z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are as in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]], and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the angular number.  This is particularly likely for an axially symmetric (for instance, harmonic) confining potential, which is commonly used.  The notion is easily generalized.  To determine &lt;math&gt;\phi(\rho,z)&lt;/math&gt;, the energy of &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; must be minimized, according to the constraint &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})=\phi(\rho,z)e^{i\ell\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. This is usually done computationally, however in a uniform medium the analytic form

:&lt;math&gt;\phi=\frac{nx}{\sqrt{2+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
{|cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;
| density far from the vortex,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,x = \frac{\rho}{\ell\xi},&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,\xi&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;
| healing length of the condensate.
|}
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

demonstrates the correct behavior, and is a good approximation.

A singly charged vortex (&lt;math&gt;\ell=1&lt;/math&gt;) is in the ground state, with its energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v=\pi n
\frac{\hbar^2}{m}\ln\left(1.464\frac{b}{\xi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
{|cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,b&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;
| the farthest distance from the vortex considered.
|}
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
(To obtain an energy which is well defined it is necessary to include this boundary &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.)

For multiply charged vortices (&lt;math&gt;\ell &gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) the energy is approximated by

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v\approx \ell^2\pi n
\frac{\hbar^2}{m}\ln\left(\frac{b}{\xi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is greater than that of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; singly charged vortices, indicating that these multiply charged vortices are unstable to decay. Research has, however, indicated they are metastable states, so may have relatively long lifetimes.

Closely related to the creation of vortices in BECs is the generation of so-called dark [[soliton]]s in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their nodal plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Becker C. ''et al.''|journal=Nature Physics|volume=4|year=2008|pages=496–501|doi=10.1038/nphys962|title=Oscillations and interactions of dark and dark–bright solitons in Bose–Einstein condensates|issue=6|bibcode = 2008NatPh...4..496B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractive interactions ==
The experiments led by Randall Hulet at Rice University from 1995 through 2000 showed that lithium condensates with attractive interactions could stably exist, but only up to a certain critical atom number.  Beyond this critical number, the attraction overwhelmed the zero-point energy of the harmonic confining potential, causing the condensate to collapse in a burst reminiscent of a supernova explosion where an explosion is preceded by an implosion.  By quench cooling the gas of lithium atoms, they observed the condensate to first grow, and subsequently collapse when the critical number was exceeded.

Further experimentation on attractive condensates was performed by the [[JILA]] team in 2000. Cornell, Wieman, and their coworkers originally used [[rubidium]]-87, an [[isotope]] whose atoms naturally repel each other, making a more stable condensate. The JILA team instrumentation now had better control over the condensate so experimentation was made on naturally ''attracting'' atoms of another rubidium isotope, rubidium-85 (having negative atom-atom [[scattering length]]). Through a process called [[Feshbach resonance]] involving a sweep of the magnetic field causing spin flip collisions, the JILA researchers lowered the characteristic, discrete energies at which the rubidium atoms bond into molecules, making their Rb-85 atoms repulsive and creating a stable condensate. The reversible flip from attraction to repulsion stems from quantum [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] among condensate atoms which behave as waves.

When the scientists raised the magnetic field strength still further, the condensate suddenly reverted back to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, and then exploded, expelling off about two-thirds of its 10,000 or so atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not being seen either in the cold remnant or the expanding gas cloud.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt; [[Carl Wieman]] explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose–Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should not be enough to cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean field theories have been proposed to explain it.  The atoms that seem to have disappeared almost certainly still exist in some form, just not in a form that could be accounted for in that experiment. Most likely they formed molecules consisting of two bonded rubidium atoms. The energy gained by making this transition imparts a velocity sufficient for them to leave the trap without being detected.

== Current research ==

Compared to more commonly encountered states of matter, Bose–Einstein condensates are extremely fragile. The slightest interaction with the outside world can be enough to warm them past the condensation threshold, eliminating their interesting properties and forming a normal gas. It is likely to be some time before any practical applications are developed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Nevertheless, they have proven useful in exploring a wide range of questions in fundamental physics, and the years since the initial discoveries by the JILA and MIT groups have seen an explosion in experimental and theoretical activity. Examples include experiments that have demonstrated [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between condensates due to [[wave-particle duality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Axel Gorlitz |url=http://cua.mit.edu/ketterle_group/Projects_1997/Interference/Interference_BEC.htm |title=Interference of Condensates (BEC@MIT) |publisher=Cua.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of [[superfluidity]] and quantized [[vortex|vortices]], the creation of bright matter wave solitons from Bose condensates confined to one dimension, and the [[slow light|slowing of light]] pulses to very low speeds using [[electromagnetically induced transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zachary Dutton, Naomi S.

Experimentalists have also realized &quot;optical lattices&quot;, where the interference pattern from overlapping lasers provides a periodic potential for the condensate. These have been used to explore the transition between a superfluid and a [[Mott insulator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qpt.physics.harvard.edu/qptsi.html |title=From Superfluid to Insulator: Bose-Einstein Condensate Undergoes a Quantum Phase Transition |publisher=Qpt.physics.harvard.edu |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be useful in studying Bose–Einstein condensation in fewer than three dimensions, for example the [[Tonks-Girardeau gas]].

Bose–Einstein condensates composed of a wide range of [[isotope]]s have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/18/6/1 |title=Ten of the best for BEC&amp;nbsp;— physicsworld.com |publisher=Physicsweb.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related experiments in cooling [[fermions]] rather than [[bosons]] to extremely low temperatures have created [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] gases, where the atoms do not congregate in a single state due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. To exhibit Bose–Einstein condensation, the fermions must &quot;pair up&quot; to form compound particles (e.g. [[molecules]] or [[BCS theory|Cooper pairs]]) that are bosons. The first [[molecule|molecular]] Bose–Einstein condensates were created in November 2003 by the groups of [[Rudolf Grimm]] at the [[University of Innsbruck]], [[Deborah S. Jin]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Jin quickly went on to create the first [[fermionic condensate]] composed of [[Cooper pair]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsweb.org/articles/news/8/1/14/1 |title=Fermionic condensate makes its debut&amp;nbsp;— physicsworld.com |publisher=Physicsweb.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Danish physicist [[Lene Hau|Lene Vestergaard Hau]] led a team from [[Harvard University]] which succeeded in [[Speed of light#In a medium|slowing a beam of light]] to about 17 metres per second{{Clarify|date=January 2010|reason=group velocity and not actual velocity?}}. She was able to achieve this by using a superfluid. Hau and her associates at Harvard University have since successfully made a group of condensate atoms recoil from a &quot;light pulse&quot; such that they recorded the light's phase and amplitude, which was recovered by a second nearby condensate, by what they term &quot;slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification&quot; using Bose–Einstein condensates: details of the experiment are discussed in an article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 8 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Naomi S. Ginsberg; Sean R. Garner; Lene Vestergaard Hau |title=Coherent control of optical information with matter wave dynamics |journal=Nature |volume=445 |date=8 February 2007 |pages=623–626 |doi=10.1038/nature05493 |pmid=17287804|issue=7128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in the new field of [[atomtronics]] use the properties of Bose–Einstein condensates when manipulating groups of identical cold atoms using lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/69786|title=Atomtronics may be the new electronics |journal=Science News Online|volume=157|date=12 February 2000|page=104|author=P. Weiss |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopes  ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
The effect has mainly been observed on alkaline atoms which have nuclear properties particularly suitable for working with traps. As of 2010, using ultra-low temperatures of {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; K}} or below, Bose–Einstein condensates had been obtained for a multitude of isotopes, mainly of [[alkali metal|alkaline]] and [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] atoms ([[lithium|&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li]], [[sodium|&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na]], [[potassium|&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;K]], [[potassium|&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;K]], [[rubidium|&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Rb]], &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb, [[caesium|&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]], [[chromium|&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr]], [[calcium|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca]], [[strontium|&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]], [[strontium|&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]], [[strontium|&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]],  and [[ytterbium|&lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb]]). Condensation research was finally successful even with hydrogen with the aid of special methods. In contrast, the superfluid state of the bosonic [[Helium|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] at temperatures below {{nowrap|2.17 K}} is not a good example of Bose–Einstein condensation, because the interaction between the &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He bosons is too strong. Only 8% of the atoms are in the single-particle ground state near zero temperature, rather than the 100% expected of a true Bose–Einstein condensate.

The [[spin-statistics theorem]] of [[Wolfgang Pauli]] states that half-integer spins (in units of &lt;math style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;\scriptstyle \hbar&lt;/math&gt;) lead to fermionic behaviour, e.g., the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] forbidding that more than two electrons possess the same energy, whereas integer spins lead to bosonic behaviour, e.g., condensation of identical bosonic particles in a common ground state.

The [[boson]]ic, rather than [[fermion]]ic, behaviour of some of these alkaline gases appears odd at first sight since their nuclei have half-integer total spin.  The bosonic behaviour arises from a subtle interplay of electronic and nuclear spins: at ultra-low temperatures and corresponding excitation energies, the half-integer total spin of the electronic shell and the half-integer total spin of the nucleus of the atom are coupled by a very weak [[hyperfine coupling|hyperfine interaction]].  The total spin of the atom arising from this coupling is an integer value leading to the bosonic ultra-low temperature behaviour of the atom.  The chemistry of the systems at room temperature is determined by the electronic properties, which is essentially fermionic, since at room temperature thermal excitations have typical energies much higher than the hyperfine values.

'''B''' is a programming language that was developed at [[Bell Labs]]. It is almost extinct, as it was replaced with the [[C (programming language)|C language]]. It was mostly the work of [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]], with contributions from [[Dennis Ritchie]], and first appeared circa 1969.

==History==
Ken Thompson wrote B basing it mainly on the [[BCPL]] language he had used to write Unix while in the [[Multics]] project. B was essentially the BCPL system stripped of any component that Thompson felt he could do without, in order to make it fit within the memory capacity of the minicomputers of the time. The language also included some changes made to suit Thompson's preferences (mostly along the lines of reducing the number of non-whitespace characters in a typical program).

Like BCPL and [[Forth (programming language)|FORTH]], B had only one datatype: the computer word. Most operators (e.g., +, -, *, /) treated this as an integer, but others treated it as a memory address to be [[Reference (computer science)|dereferenced]]. In many other ways it looked a lot like an early version of C. A few library functions existed, including some that vaguely resemble functions from the [[stdio.h|standard I/O library]] in C.

Early implementations were for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-7]] and [[PDP-11]] minicomputers using early [[Unix]], and [[Honeywell]] 36-bit mainframes running the operating system [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GCOS]]. The earliest PDP-7 implementations compiled to [[threaded code]], and then Ritchie wrote a compiler using [[TMG (programming language)|TMG]] which produced machine code.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multicians.org/tmg.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 a [[PDP-11]] was acquired and threaded code was used for the port. The first version of [[yacc]] was produced with this PDP-11 configuration. Ritchie took over maintenance during this period.

The typeless nature of B made sense on the Honeywell, PDP-7 and many older computers, but was a problem on the PDP-11 because it was difficult to elegantly access the character data type that the PDP-11 and most modern computers fully support. Starting in 1971 Ritchie made changes to the language while converting its compiler to produce machine code, most notably adding data typing for variables. During 1971 and 1972 B evolved into &quot;New B&quot; and then C, with the [[preprocessor]] being added in 1972 and early 1973 at the urging of [[Alan Snyder]]. The effort was sufficiently complete that during the summer of 1973 the Unix kernel for the PDP-11 was rewritten in C. During the 1972–73 period there was a need to port to Honeywell 635 and IBM 360/370 machines, so [[Mike Lesk]] wrote the &quot;portable I/O package&quot; which would become the C &quot;standard I/O&quot; routines.

B continued to see use as late as the 1990s on Honeywell mainframes, and on certain [[embedded systems]] for a variety of reasons, including limited hardware in the small systems; extensive libraries, tools, licensing cost issues; and simply being good enough for the job on others. The highly influential [[AberMUD]] was originally written in B.

B was greatly influenced by BCPL, and its name is most likely to be a contraction of BCPL.  However it is possible that its name may be based on [[Bon (programming language)|Bon]], an earlier but unrelated, and rather different, programming language that Thompson designed for use on [[Multics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Beer–Lambert law in solution.JPG|thumb|300px|An example of Beer–Lambert law: green laser light in a solution of Rhodamine 6B.  The beam intensity becomes weaker as it passes through solution]]
In [[optics]], the '''Beer–Lambert law''', also known as '''Beer's law''' or the '''Lambert–Beer law''' or the '''Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law''' relates the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[light]] to the properties of the material through which the light is traveling.

==Equations==
[[Image:Beer lambert.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of Beer–Lambert absorption of a beam of light as it travels through a [[cuvette]] of width ''ℓ''.]]

The law states that there is a logarithmic dependence between the transmission (or transmissivity), ''T'', of light through a substance and the product of the [[absorption coefficient]] of the substance, ''α'', and the distance the light travels through the material (i.e. the path length), ''ℓ''. The [[absorption coefficient]] can, in turn, be written as a product of either a [[molar absorptivity]] (extinction coefficient) of the absorber, ''ε'', and the [[concentration]] ''c'' of absorbing species in the material, or an [[absorption cross section]], ''σ'', and the (number) density ''N' of absorbers.

For liquids, these relations are usually written as:

:&lt;math&gt; T = {I\over I_{0}} = 10^{-\alpha\, \ell} = 10^{-\varepsilon\ell  c} &lt;/math&gt;

whereas for gases, and in particular among physicists and for spectroscopy and spectrophotometry, they are normally written 

:&lt;math&gt; T = {I\over I_{0}} = e^{-\alpha'\, l} = e^{-\sigma \ell N} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I'' are the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] (or [[power (physics)|power]]) of the incident light and the transmitted light, respectively; σ is cross section of light absorption by a single particle and N is the density (number per unit volume) of absorbing particles.

The [[common logarithm|base 10]] and [[natural logarithm|base ''e'']] conventions must not be confused because they give different values for the absorption coefficient: &lt;math&gt;\alpha\neq\alpha'&lt;/math&gt;. However, it is easy to convert one to the other, using &lt;math&gt;\alpha' = \alpha \ln(10)\approx 2.303\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. 

The transmission (or transmissivity) is expressed in terms of an [[absorbance]] which, for liquids, is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt; A = -\log_{10} \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

whereas, for gases, it is usually defined as 

:&lt;math&gt; A' = -\ln  \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that the [[absorbance]] becomes linear with the concentration (or number density of absorbers) according to 

:&lt;math&gt; A = \varepsilon \ell c = \alpha\ell \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; A' = \sigma \ell  N = \alpha' \ell \,&lt;/math&gt;

for the two cases, respectively.

Thus, if the path length and the [[molar absorptivity]] (or the [[absorption cross section]]) are known and the [[absorbance]] is measured, the concentration of the substance (or the number density of absorbers) can be deduced.

Although several of the expressions above often are used as Beer–Lambert law, the name should strictly speaking only be associated with the latter two. The reason is that historically, the Lambert law states that absorption is proportional to the light path length, whereas the Beer law states that absorption is proportional to the concentration of absorbing species in the material.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. J. Ingle and S. R. Crouch, ''Spectrochemical Analysis'', Prentice Hall, New Jersey (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

If the concentration is expressed as a [[mole fraction]] i.e. a dimensionless fraction, the molar absorptivity (''ε'') takes the same dimension as the absorption coefficient, i.e. [[reciprocal length]] (e.g. m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, if the concentration is expressed in [[mole (unit)|moles]] per unit [[volume]], the molar absorptivity (''ε'') is used in [[liter|L]]·mol&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;·cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, or sometimes in converted  SI  units of m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·mol&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[absorption coefficient]] ''α''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is one of many ways to describe the absorption of electromagnetic waves. For the others, and their interrelationships, see the article: [[Mathematical descriptions of opacity]]. For example, ''α''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; can be expressed in terms of the [[imaginary part]] of the [[refractive index]], ''κ'', and the [[wavelength]] of the light (in free space), ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, according to

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha' = \frac{4 \pi \kappa}{\lambda_{0}}.&lt;/math&gt; 

In molecular absorption spectrometry, the absorption cross section ''σ'' is expressed in terms of a linestrength, ''S'', and an (area-normalized) lineshape function, ''Φ''. The frequency scale in molecular spectroscopy is often in cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, wherefore the lineshape function is expressed in units of 1/cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which can look funny but is strictly correct. Since ''N'' is given as a number density in units of 1/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the linestrength is often given in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;/molecule. A typical linestrength in one of the vibrational overtone bands of smaller molecules, e.g. around 1.5 μm in CO or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;23&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, although it can be larger for species with strong transitions, e.g. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The linestrengths of various transitions can be found in large databases, e.g. HITRAN. The lineshape function often takes a value around a few 1/cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, up to around 10/cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; under low pressure conditions, when the transition is Doppler broadened, and below this under atmospheric pressure conditions, when the transition is collision broadened. It has also become commonplace to express the linestrength in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;/atm since then the concentration is given in terms of a pressure in units of atm. A typical linestrength is then often in the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;/atm. Under these conditions, the detectability of a given technique is often quoted in terms of ppm•m.  

The fact that there are two commensurate definitions of absorbance (in base 10 or e) implies that the [[absorbance]] and the [[absorption coefficient]] for the cases with gases, ''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; and ''α''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, are ln&amp;nbsp;10 (approximately 2.3) times as large as the corresponding values for liquids, i.e. ''A'' and ''α'', respectively.  Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting data that the correct form of the law is used.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly [[scattering]]. If the light is especially intense, [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] processes can also cause variances.

==Derivation==
The derivation is quite simple in concept.  There are many details, so think of this first paragraph as a conceptual overview.  Divide the absorbing sample into thin slices that are perpendicular to the beam of light.  The light that emerges from a slice is slightly less intense than the light that entered because some of the photons have run into molecules in the sample and did not make it to the other side.  For most cases where measurements of absorption are needed, a vast majority of the light entering the slice leaves without being absorbed.  Because the physical description of the problem is in terms of differences---intensity before and after light passes through the slice---we can easily write an ordinary differential equation model for absorption.  The difference in intensity due to the slice of absorbing material &lt;math&gt;dI&lt;/math&gt; is reduced; leaving the slice, it is a fraction &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of the light entering the slice &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.  The thickness of the slice is &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt;, which scales the amount of absorption (thin slice does not absorb much light but a thick slice absorbs a lot).  In symbols, &lt;math&gt;dI = \beta I dz&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;dI/dz = \beta I &lt;/math&gt;.  This conceptual overview uses &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; to describe how much light is absorbed.  All we can say about the value of this constant is that it will be different for each material.  Also, its values should be constrained between -1 and 0.  The following paragraphs cover the meaning of this constant and the whole derivation in much greater detail.

Assume that particles may be described as having an absorption cross section (i.e. area), ''σ'', perpendicular to the path of light through a solution, such that a photon of light is absorbed if it strikes the particle, and is transmitted if it does not.

Define ''z'' as an axis parallel to the direction that photons of light are moving, and ''A'' and ''dz'' as the area and thickness  (along the ''z'' axis) of a  3-dimensional slab of space through which light is passing.  
We assume that ''dz'' is sufficiently small that one particle in the slab cannot obscure another particle in the slab when viewed along the ''z'' direction. The concentration of particles in the slab is represented by ''N''.

It follows that the fraction of photons absorbed when passing through this slab is equal to the total opaque area of the particles in the slab, ''σAN&amp;nbsp;dz'', divided by the area of the slab ''A'', which yields ''σN&amp;nbsp;dz''.   Expressing the number of photons absorbed by the slab as ''dI''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;,  and the total number of photons incident on the slab as  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;,  the fraction of photons absorbed by the slab is given by

:&lt;math&gt; dI_z = - \sigma N\,I_z\,dz  .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that because there are fewer photons which pass through the slab than are incident on it, ''dI''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is actually negative (It is proportional in magnitude to the number of photons absorbed).

The solution to this simple differential equation is obtained by integrating both sides to obtain ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of ''z''

:&lt;math&gt; \ln(I_z) = - \sigma N z  +  C . \,&lt;/math&gt;

The difference of intensity for a slab of real thickness ℓ is ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''. Using the previous equation, the difference in intensity can be written as,

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(I_l) - \ln(I_0) = (- \sigma \ell N + C) - ( - \sigma 0 N + C) = - \sigma \ell  N \,&lt;/math&gt;

rearranging and exponentiating yields,

:&lt;math&gt;\ T  = \frac{I_l}{I_0} = e ^ {- \sigma \ell  N} = e ^ {- \alpha'\ell} .&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that

:&lt;math&gt; A' = - \ln\left( \frac{I_l}{I_0} \right) = \alpha' \ell = \sigma\ell  N \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; A = - \log_{10}\left( \frac{I_l}{I_0} \right) = \frac{\alpha'\ell}{2.303} = \alpha \ell = \varepsilon \ell  c. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation assumes that every absorbing particle behaves independently with respect to the light and is not affected by other particles. Error is introduced when particles are lying along the same optical path such that some particles are in the ''shadow'' of others.  This occurs in highly concentrated solutions.  In practice, when large absorption values are measured, dilution is required to achieve accurate results.  Measurements of absorption in the range of &lt;math&gt;{I_1} / {I_0} = 0.1&lt;/math&gt; to 1 are less affected by shadowing than other sources of random error.  In this range, the ODE model developed above is a good approximation; measurements of absorption in this range are linearly related to concentration.  At higher absorbances, concentrations will be underestimated due to this shadow effect unless one employs a more sophisticated model that describes the non-linear relationship between absorption and concentration.

== Prerequisites  ==
There are at least six conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for Beer’s law to be valid. These are: 
# The absorbers must act independently of each other; 
# The absorbing medium must be homogeneous in the interaction volume
# The absorbing medium must not scatter the radiation - no [[turbidity]]; 
# The incident radiation must consist of parallel rays, each traversing the same length in the absorbing medium; 
# The incident radiation should preferably be [[monochromatic]], or have at least a width that is more narrow than the absorbing transition; and
# The incident flux must not influence the atoms or molecules; it should only act as a non-invasive probe of the species under study. In particular, this implies that the light should not cause optical saturation or optical pumping, since such effects will deplete the lower level and possibly give rise to stimulated emission.
If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, there will be deviations from Beer’s law.

== Chemical analysis ==
Beer's law can be applied to the analysis of a mixture by spectrophotometry, without the need for extensive pre-processing of the sample. An example is the determination of [[bilirubin]] in blood plasma samples. The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the molar absorbance is known. Measurements are made at one wavelength that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences.The concentration is given by ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;corrected&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''ε''.

For a more complicated example, consider a mixture in solution containing two components at concentrations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The absorbance at any wavelength, λ is, for unit path length, given by

:&lt;math&gt;A(\lambda)=c_1\ \varepsilon_1(\lambda)+c_2\ \varepsilon_2(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, measurements at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns and will suffice to determine the concentrations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as long as the molar absorbances of the two components, ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]]. In practice it is better to use [[linear least squares]] to determine the two concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analysed in the same way, using a minimum of ''n'' wavelengths for a mixture containing ''n'' components.

The law is used widely in [[infra-red spectroscopy]] for analysis of [[polymer degradation]] and [[oxidation]]. The [[carbonyl group]] absorption at about 6 micrometres can be detected quite easily, and degree of oxidation of the [[polymer]] calculated.

==  Beer–Lambert law in the atmosphere ==
This law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar or stellar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The Beer–Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written

:&lt;math&gt;I = I_0\,\exp(-m(\tau_a+\tau_g+\tau_{\rm NO_2}+\tau_w+\tau_{\rm O_3}+\tau_r)),&lt;/math&gt;

where each &lt;math&gt;\tau_{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[optical depth]] whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:

*&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; refers to [[Particulate|aerosols]] (that absorb and scatter)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly mixed gases (mainly [[carbon dioxide]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;)  and molecular [[oxygen]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;) which only absorb)
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NO}_2&lt;/math&gt; is [[nitrogen dioxide]], mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only)
*&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is [[water vapour]] [[water absorption|absorption]]
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}_3&lt;/math&gt; is [[ozone]] (absorption only)
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is [[Rayleigh scattering]] from molecular [[oxygen]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;) and [[nitrogen]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N}_2&lt;/math&gt;) (responsible for the blue color of the sky).

&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the ''optical mass'' or ''[[airmass|airmass factor]]'', a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) to &lt;math&gt;1/\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the observed object's [[celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] (the angle measured from
the direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site).

This equation can be used to retrieve &lt;math&gt;\tau_{a}&lt;/math&gt;, the aerosol [[optical depth|optical thickness]],
which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of
aerosols in climate.

When the path taken by the light is through the atmosphere, the density of the absorbing gas is not constant, so the original equation must be modified as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; T = {I_{1}\over I_{0}} = e^{-\int\alpha'\, dz} = e^{-\sigma\int N dz} &lt;/math&gt;
where z is the distance along the path through the atmosphere, all other symbols are as defined above.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 0521339561 Houghton, J.T. The Physics of Atmospheres 2nd ed. Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  This is taken into account in each &lt;math&gt;\tau_{x}&lt;/math&gt; in the atmospheric equation above.

==History==
The law was discovered by [[Pierre Bouguer]] before 1729. It is often mis-attributed to [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who cited Bouguer's ''Essai d'Optique sur la Gradation de la Lumiere'' (Claude Jombert, Paris, 1729) — and even quoted from it — in his ''Photometria'' in 1760. Much later, [[August Beer]] extended the exponential absorption law in 1852 to include the concentration of solutions in the absorption coefficient.

'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in 1961 in [[Hawthorne, California]]. The group was initially composed of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], The Beach Boys signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its [[close harmony|close vocal harmonies]] and lyrics reflecting a [[Southern California]] youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot; single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that was a far cry from the simple [[surf rock]] of The Beach Boys' early years.

However, Wilson would soon lose control of the band because of mental-health and substance-abuse issues. Subsequently, although it released a number of popular albums (in various musical styles, with different line-ups) in ensuing years, the group never managed to reclaim its mid-'60s peak when The Beach Boys briefly challenged [[The Beatles]] both in terms of commercial and critical appeal. Since the 1980s, there has been much legal-wrangling among the group members over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. While The Beach Boys released their last studio album in 1996, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by a surviving member of the original quintet (Dennis and Carl Wilson died in 1983 and 1998, respectively), continue to tour.

The Beach Boys have often been called &quot;America's Band&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cherry070802.asp &quot;Still America's Band: The Beach Boys Today&quot;] Kevin M.

==History==
===Formative years===
At age 16, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl, in their family home in Hawthorne. He watched his father, [[Murry Wilson]], play piano and listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups like [[The Four Freshmen]]. One night he taught his brothers a song called &quot;Ivory Tower&quot; and how to sing the background harmonies. &quot;We practiced night after night, singing softly, hoping we wouldn't wake our Dad.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; For his 16th birthday, Brian was given a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. He would play piano and later added Carl playing the [[Rickenbacker]] guitar he got as a Christmas present.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rickenbacker 360.png|240px|thumb|right|A [[Rickenbacker 360/12|Rickenbacker 360 12-string guitar]] similar to the one used by Carl Wilson in the early sixties.]]
Soon Brian was avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]] on his KFOX radio show, a favorite station of Carl's. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, he changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. He failed to complete a twelfth-grade [[piano sonata]], but did submit an original composition, called &quot;Surfin'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]], drawing tremendous applause for their version of [[doo-wop]] group [[The Olympics (band)|The Olympics]]' &quot;[[Hully Gully (song)|Hully Gully]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate, who had already played guitar in a folk group called The Islanders. One day, on the spur of the moment, they asked a couple of football players in the school training room to learn harmony parts, but it wasn't a success—the bass singer was flat.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. It was at these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, that &quot;the Beach Boys sound&quot; began to form. Brian says: &quot;Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't [then] play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence.&quot; Love encouraged Brian to write songs and gave the fledgling band its name: The Pendletones, derived from the [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton woolen shirts]] popular at the time. In their earliest performances, the band wore the heavy wool jacket-like shirts, which were favored by surfers in the South Bay. Although [[surfing]] motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only band-member who surfed.&lt;ref name=pc20/&gt; He suggested that his brothers compose some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ofemsa&quot;&gt;Wilson, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian's to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record—&quot;[[Sloop John B]]&quot;. In Brian's absence, the two spoke with Murry, a music industry veteran of modest success. In September 1961, Murry arranged for The Pendletones to meet publishers Hite and Dorinda Morgan at Stereo Masters in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The group performed a slower ballad, &quot;[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]&quot;, but failed to impress the Morgans. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, &quot;Surfin'&quot;. Brian was taken aback—he had not finished writing the song—but Hite Morgan was interested and asked them to call back when the song was complete.&lt;ref name = &quot;ofemsa&quot;/&gt;

With help from Love, Brian finished the song and the group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones. They practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation. When they auditioned again a few days later, Hite Morgan declared: &quot;That's a smash!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In October, The Pendletones recorded twelve takes of &quot;Surfin'&quot; in the Morgans' cramped offices. A small number of singles were pressed. When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles, on the [[Candix Records]] label, they were shocked to see their band name changed to &quot;Beach Boys&quot;. Murry Wilson, now intimately involved with the band's fortunes, called the Morgans. Apparently a young promotion worker, Russ Regan, made the change to more obviously tie the group in with other surf bands of the time. The limited budget meant the labels could not be reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:The Beach Boys Ed Sulivan.png|thumb|left|260px|The Beach Boys performing on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] in September 1964]]
{{listen|filename= The Beach Boys - I Get Around.ogg|title= &quot;I Get Around&quot;|description=An excerpt from the Brian Wilson and Mike Love song &quot;I Get Around&quot;, demonstrating Mike Love's lead vocals and Carl Wilson's surf rock styled guitar solo.}}
Released November 1961, &quot;[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]&quot; was soon aired on KFWB and KDAY, two of Los Angeles' most influential radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. Murry Wilson told the boys he did not like &quot;Surfin'&quot;. However, according to Brian, &quot;he smelled money to be made and jumped on the promotional bandwagon, calling every radio station...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; By now the de-facto manager of The Beach Boys, Murry got the group's first paying gig on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], headlined by [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]]. Brian recalls how he wondered what they were doing there; &quot;five clean-cut, unworldly white boys from a conservative white suburb, in an auditorium full of black kids&quot;. Brian describes the night as an &quot;education&quot;—he knew afterwards that success was all about &quot;R&amp;B, rock and roll, and money&quot;. The boys went home with $50 apiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;WILSON53&quot;&gt;Wilson, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1962, Jardine left the band to continue his college studies.&lt;ref name=WILSON53/&gt; [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]], a thirteen-year-old neighbor and friend of Carl and Dennis who had been playing electric guitar for years with Carl, replaced him. (Jardine, at Brian's request, rejoined the band in July 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/home.aspx |title=The Beach Boys |publisher=The Beach Boys |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, The Beach Boys began wearing blue/gray-striped button-down shirts tucked into white pants as their touring &quot;uniforms&quot;, the band's signature look through to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band without consultation, Brian acknowledges that he &quot;deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... [but] also worked hard himself&quot;. He was the first to stress the importance of having a follow-up hit.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The band duly recorded four more originals, on June 13 at Western Studios, Los Angeles, including &quot;[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]&quot;, &quot;[[409 (song)|409]]&quot; and &quot;[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]&quot;. The session ended on a bitter note, however: Murry Wilson unsuccessfully suggested and then demanded that The Beach Boys record some of his own songs, saying &quot;My songs are better than yours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, on the strength of the June demo session, The Beach Boys were signed to [[Capitol Records]]. By November, their first album was ready—''[[Surfin' Safari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/r1405|title= Richie Unterberger review of Surfin' Safari|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =25 May 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle.&lt;ref name=pc20&gt;[http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19770/m1/ Show 20 - Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The early Beach Boys’ hits helped raise both the profile of the state of California and of surfing. The group also celebrated the Golden State’s obsession with [[hot-rod]] racing (&quot;[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]]&quot;, &quot;409&quot; and &quot;[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]]&quot;) and the pursuit of happiness by carefree teens in less complicated times (&quot;[[Be True to Your School]]&quot;, &quot;[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Get Around]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/hot-rod-d2780|title= Hot rod rock|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =23 April 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; has been stated as one of the earliest forms of [[hard rock]] with its series of buzzing beats.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milward, ''The Beach Boys Silver  Anniversary'', (Doubleday, 1985), ISBN 0385196504, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Murry Wilson and the close vocal harmonies of Brian's favorite groups, early inspiration came from the driving rock-and-roll sound of [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] production. Musically, their early songs are often based on those of others; for instance, &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; shares its rhythmic melody with &quot;[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]&quot;, while &quot;[[Surfin' USA]]&quot; is a slight variation of Berry's &quot;[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=pc5&gt;[http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ Show 5 - Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The rock revolution gets underway. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Beach Boys' early hits made them major pop stars in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, with sixteen hit singles in 1962–1965. However, with the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, some British groups, in particular [[The Beatles]], eclipsed their success.

===Brian Wilson's innovations and personal difficulties===
By 1964, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much to bear for Brian Wilson. In December that year, while on a flight to Houston, Brian suffered from an anxiety attack and left the tour. Shortly afterward, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. This wasn't the first time Brian had stopped touring. In 1963, when Jardine returned, Brian left the road; but when Marks quit, Brian had to return in his place. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, [[Glen Campbell]] served as Wilson's replacement in concert, until his own career success required him to leave the group. [[Bruce Johnston]] was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road and later contributing his own talents in the studio beginning with the sessions for &quot;[[California Girls]]&quot;.

[[Jan and Dean]], close friends with the band and their opening act 1963 and 1964, encouraged Brian to use [[session musician]]s in the studio. This, along with Brian's withdrawal from touring, permitted him to expand his role as a producer. Wilson also wrote &quot;[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]&quot; for the Jan &amp; Dean opening act. Their recording hit number one on the US charts in the summer of 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had &quot;given away&quot; what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper. A year later, The Beach Boys would notch their first number-one single with &quot;I Get Around.&quot;

Soon, traces of Brian Wilson's increasing studio productivity and innovation were noticeable: &quot;Drive-In&quot;, an album track from ''[[All Summer Long]]'' (1964) features bars of silence between two verses while &quot;Denny's Drums&quot;, the last track on ''[[Shut Down, Vol. II]]'' (1964), is a two-minute drum solo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.allmusic.com/album/shut-down-vol-2-r60307|title= Ritchie Unterberger review of Shut Down Vol. 2 |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =23 April 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wilson's musical efforts became more ambitious, the group relied more on nimble session players, on tracks such as &quot;I Get Around&quot; and &quot;[[When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)]]&quot;. &quot;[[Help Me, Rhonda]]&quot; became the band's second number-one single in the spring of 1965.

1965 led to greater experimentation behind the soundboard with Wilson. The album ''[[Today!]]'' featured less focus on guitars, more emphasis on keyboards and percussion, as well as volume experiments and increased lyrical maturity. Side A of the album was devoted to sunnier pop tunes, with darker [[ballads]] on the reverse side.  This pattern was also evident on some of the band's singles; songs such as &quot;[[Kiss Me, Baby]]&quot; released on the B-side to &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and &quot;[[Let Him Run Wild]]&quot; on the B-side to &quot;California Girls&quot;, each featured Brian Wilson on lead vocals, and foreshadowed the youthful angst that would later pervade Wilson's upcoming efforts.

In November 1965, the group followed up their number-three summer smash &quot;California Girls&quot; with another top 20 single, &quot;[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]&quot;. It is considered to be the band's most experimental statement thus far, using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass, and vocal tics. Perhaps too extreme an arrangement to go much higher than its modest number 20 peak, it was only the band's second single not to reach the top 10 since their 1962 breakthrough. In December they would score an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with the single &quot;[[Barbara Ann]]&quot;, which Capitol released as a single without input from any of The Beach Boys. A cover of a 1961 song by [[The Regents]], it became one of The Beach Boys most recognized hits over the years.

===The peak years and psychedelia===
{{Pquote|Yeah. I had taken a few drugs, and I had gotten into that kind of thing.

During the mid sixties, The Beach Boys left surfing behind and began to write surreal, melodramatic and revolutionary songs. Like other contemporaneous acts, such as [[The Byrds]] and [[The Yardbirds]], the group were also exploring similar musical tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palmer, Robert.|page=165|year=1995|title=Rock &amp; Roll: An Unruly History|publisher=Harmony|isbn=0-51770-050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rounds, Dwight.|page=59|year=2007|title=The Year the Music Died: 1964-1972|publisher=Bridgeway Books|isbn=1-93353-869-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;During there psychedelic period, The Beach Boys started to use unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on there groundbreaking record [[Pet Sounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.allmusic.com/album/pet-sounds-r485904| title =Richie Unterberger review of Pet Sounds| publisher = Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Tunbridge, The Song Cycle , (Cambridge University Press, 2011), ISBN 0521721075, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; A heralding album in the emerging [[psychedelic rock]] style, ''Pet Sounds'' has been championed and emulated for its experimental and revolutionary [[baroque pop| baroque]]  instrumentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated35&quot;&gt;J.

In December 1965, The Beatles released ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', an album which enthralled Brian Wilson.  Until then, each Beach Boys album (like most rock albums) contained a few &quot;filler tracks&quot; like cover songs or even stitched-together comedy bits. Wilson found ''Rubber Soul'' filled with all-original songs and, more importantly, all good ones, none of them filler. Inspired, he rushed to his wife and proclaimed, &quot;Marilyn, I'm gonna make the greatest album! The greatest rock album ever made!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Carlin, Peter Ames | title=''Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, &amp; Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson''| publisher=[[Rodale Books]] (New York)| year=2006 | isbn=13-978-1-59486-320-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen|filename= The Beach Boys - God only knows.ogg|title=&quot;God Only Knows&quot; from ''Pet Sounds'' (1966)|description=''God Only Knows'' broke new ground in many ways. It was one of the first commercial songs to use the word 'God' in its title.

The result was ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), where Wilson's growing mastery of studio recording and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements would reach a creative peak. Influenced by psychedelic drugs, Brian Wilson turned his attention inward and probe his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated35&quot;&gt;J. DeRogatis, ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukie, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), ISBN 0634055488, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Beach Boys didn't look at the problems in the world around them, unlike other psychedelic rock groups.&lt;ref&gt;J. DeRogatis, ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukee, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), ISBN 0634055488&lt;/ref&gt; The album's meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]) set a new standard for pop music.&lt;ref&gt;

Schwartz, Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew, (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2010), ISBN 188840812X, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;It remains one of the most evocative releases of the decade, with distinctive strains of lushness, melancholy, and nostalgia for youth. The tracks &quot;[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]&quot; and &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot;, showcased Wilson's growing mastery as a composer, [[orchestration|arranger]], and producer,&lt;ref name=pc20/&gt; as did &quot;[[Caroline, No]]&quot;, which was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time he was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years. The album also included two sophisticated instrumental tracks, the quiet and wistful &quot;[[Let's Go Away for Awhile]]&quot; and the brittle brassy surf of the title track, &quot;[[Pet Sounds (instrumental)|Pet Sounds]]&quot;. Despite the critical praise it received, ''Pet Sounds'' was indifferently promoted by Capitol, and failed to become the major hit Wilson had hoped it would be.&lt;ref name=pc37&gt;[http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19796/m1/ Show 37 - The Rubberization of Soul: The great pop music renaissance.

''Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, &amp; Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson'', n. 27 supra.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it only reached number 10 in the US, it was a much better seller in the UK.

Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing tracks for the album while The Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, calling it &quot;Brian's ego music&quot;, and warning the composer not to &quot;fuck with the formula&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=58 |title=– By Michael Fremer |publisher=Musicangle.com |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other group members also fretted that the band would lose its core audience if they changed their successful musical blueprint. Another likely factor in Love's antipathy to ''Pet Sounds'' was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist [[Tony Asher]] rather than with Love himself, who had co-written the lyrics for, and sung lead on, many of their early hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;tracks&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Elliott | first =Brad  | url =http://www.beachboysfanclub.com/ps-tracks.html  | title = Pet Sounds Track Notes | publisher =beachboysfanclub.com | date=August 31, 1999 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Good Vibrations''====
Seeking to expand on the advances made on ''Pet Sounds'', Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed ''Dumb Angel''. Its first fruit was &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot;, which Brian described as a &quot;pocket symphony&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated35&quot;&gt;J. DeRogatis, ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukee, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), ISBN 0634055488, p.638.&lt;/ref&gt; The song became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date and a US and UK number-one single in 1966; many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. It was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded at that time. Costing a reported $16,000, more than most rock ''albums'', sessions for the song stretched over several months in at least three major studios. According to Wilson, the electro-theremin work itself cost $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|title=Interview with Brian Wilson|publisher=theaquarian.com|accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to his work on ''Pet Sounds'', Wilson adopted a modular approach to &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;:  he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound and ambience of each facility.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Kubernik, Scott Calamar, Lou Adler, Canyon of Dreams: The Magic and the Music of Laurel Canyon, (Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), ISBN	1402765894, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, [[Hammond organ]], piano, [[tack piano]], two basses, guitars, [[electro-theremin]], [[harmonica]], and cello. The group members recall the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlin, Peter Ames 2006&quot;/&gt;

====''Smile''====
While putting the finishing touches on ''Pet Sounds,'' and just beginning work on &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, Brian Wilson met musician and songwriter [[Van Dyke Parks]]. In late 1966, Brian and Parks began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for the Beach Boys' next album, which was eventually named ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The unusual capitalization of the title, &quot;SMiLE&quot;, is an accident of Capitol Records' mid-1960s graphic design. Brian himself wrote it as &quot;Smile&quot; on his own message board.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the same techniques as on &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, recording began in August 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been the subjects of endless speculation, it is known that Wilson and Parks intended ''Smile'' to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs.
{{Listen|filename=Beach_Boys_-_Good_Vibrations.ogg|title=&quot;Good Vibrations&quot;|description=One of the Beach Boys' defining songs and there most well known psychedelic track.}}
But some of the other Beach Boys, especially Love, found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style. Another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to ''Smile'' and was particularly critical of Parks' lyrics; he has also since stated that he was deeply concerned about Wilson's escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of &quot;[[Cabinessence]]&quot;, when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, &quot;Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield.&quot; After a heated argument, Parks walked out of the session, and shortly thereafter his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end.

Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as ''Smile'' neared completion: his own mental instability, the pressure to create against fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic public response to ''Pet Sounds'', Carl Wilson's [[military draft|draft]] resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol Records. Further, Wilson's reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, [[amphetamine]]s in particular, only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. In May 1967, ''Smile'' was shelved, and over the next thirty years, the legends surrounding ''Smile'' grew until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Priore, Dominic (1997), ''Look Listen Vibrate Smile'', Last Gasp pub., collects much of the &quot;Smile&quot; legend in historical articles and reviews.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some of the tracks were salvaged and re-recorded at Brian's new home studio, albeit in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the single version of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and a re-recorded &quot;[[Heroes and Villains]]&quot;, on the 1967 LP ''[[Smiley Smile]]''. The album proved to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group, peaking at only number 41 in the US. By this time The Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and [[David Anderle]]) had created the band's own record label, [[Brother Records|Brother]]. One of the first labels to be owned by a rock group, the purpose of Brother Records was for releases by Beach Boys side projects, and an invitation for new talent. The Beach Boys became one of the first rock bands to create their own label. The output of the label, however, was limited to ''Smiley Smile'' and two resulting singles from the album; the failure of &quot;[[Gettin' Hungry]]&quot; made the band shelve the Brother label until 1970. Compounding these setbacks, the group's public image took another hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]].

Despite the cancellation of ''Smile,'' interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks—including &quot;[[Our Prayer]]&quot;, &quot;Cabinessence&quot;, &quot;[[Cool, Cool Water]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Surf's Up (Beach Boys song)|Surf's Up]]&quot;—continued to trickle out. Many were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was still expecting to complete and release ''Smile'' as late as 1972, before it became clear that Brian had been the only one who could have made sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. The full ''Smile'' project did not surface until the 2000s, when Wilson reunited with Parks to complete its writing. Subsequently, Wilson released the re-recorded ''[[Smile (Brian Wilson album)|Smile]]'' in 2004 as a solo album.

===Mid-career changes===
[[File:Carl Wilson Gibson ES-335.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Carl Wilson playing the [[Gibson ES-335]]]]
The 1967 album ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'', regarded by some as another classic, features songs written by Wilson and Love, including the hit &quot;[[Darlin' (Beach Boys song)|Darlin']]&quot; and a rendition of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s &quot;[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]&quot;. The album fared better than its predecessor in the charts, reaching number 24 in the US. The following album ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]'' (1968) was partly influenced by the group's (especially Love's) adoption of the practice of [[Transcendental Meditation]]. The title song &quot;[[Friends (The Beach Boys song)|Friends]]&quot; was their least successful single since 1962, charting at number 47. This was followed by the single &quot;[[Do It Again (Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]&quot;, a return to the formula of their early years. Moderately successful in the US at number 20, the single went to top of the UK single charts in 1968 for one week. The album, however, bombed; ''Friends'' could only peak at number 126 in the US.

As Brian's mental and physical health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished; he eventually became withdrawn and detached from the band. To fill his creative void, the other members began writing and producing songs. Carl Wilson gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' (1969) was primarily a collection of leftovers (including remnants from ''Smile''), old songs by outside writers, and several new songs by Dennis Wilson. Another flop, it still fared better than ''Friends'', reaching number 68 on the ''Billboard'' charts.

In 1969, The Beach Boys reactivated their Brother Records label and signed with [[Reprise Records]]. With the new contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album ''[[Sunflower (album)|Sunflower]]'' to critical acclaim. ''Sunflower'' is recognized as a complete group effort, with all band members contributing significant material, such as &quot;[[Add Some Music to Your Day]]&quot;, Brian's &quot;[[This Whole World]]&quot;, Dennis's &quot;[[Forever (The Beach Boys song)|Forever]]&quot; and Bruce Johnston's &quot;[[Tears in the Morning]]&quot;. However, the band experienced their worst chart performance ever, peaking at number 151, although the single &quot;[[Cottonfields]]&quot;—which appeared on European releases of ''Sunflower''—hit the top five in the UK.

After ''Sunflower'', the band hired [[Jack Rieley]] as their manager. Rieley chose a different direction for the group, emphasizing, among other things, political and social awareness. The result was ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' (1971), featuring Brian's ''Smile'' centerpiece, &quot;[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]&quot;. The song was virtually the same arrangement as Brian's 1966 version, with Carl adding vocals and overdubs. Carl's &quot;[[Long Promised Road]]&quot; and &quot;[[Feel Flows]]&quot; are also standouts on the record. Brian contributed one of his best songs,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} &quot;[['Til I Die]]&quot;, which almost did not make the album sequencing. Johnston produced the classic &quot;[[Disney Girls (1957)]]&quot;, a throwback to the easier, simpler times they remembered. Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after the record's release, reportedly because of friction with Rieley. The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, The Beach Boys added to their re-found fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]], and followed that with a famous appearance with the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[Fillmore East]] on April 27, 1971.

The addition of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[Blondie Chaplin]] in February 1972, led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. The album ''[[Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;]]'' was an uncharacteristic mix that included several songs drawn from Fataar and Chaplin's previous group, Flame, which are nearly unrecognizable as Beach Boys songs. Although it has its supporters, the album is widely considered to be one of the group's most unfocused and inconsistent. It did not make an impact on the charts.

The Beach Boys came up with an ambitious plan in developing their next project. The band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972, renting a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio. By the end of their sessions the band felt they had come up with one of their best efforts yet. Reprise, however, felt that the album was weak, and after some wrangling between the camps, the band asked Brian to come up with commercial material. This resulted in the song &quot;[[Sail On, Sailor]]&quot;, a collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, became one of the most emblematic Beach Boys songs. Reprise approved and the resulting album ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'' was released early 1973, peaking at number 37 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Brian's storytale ''Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)'', which was directly influenced by [[Randy Newman]]'s ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' LP, was included as a &quot;bonus&quot; [[extended play]] (EP). ''Holland'' proved that the band could still produce contemporary songs with wide (if not mass) appeal.

Despite record-label indifference, the band's concert audience started to grow. ''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'', a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top 30 hit and became the band's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for Reprise.

===''Endless Summer''===
In the summer of 1974, Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of The Beach Boys' pre-''Pet Sounds'' hits. ''[[Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'', helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, caught the mood of the nation and surged to the top of the ''Billboard'' album charts, a first for the band. It was the group's first multi-million selling record since &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and remained on the album chart for three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mp3.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.mp3.com/albums/1194/summary.html Endless Summer, The Beach Boys], ''mp3.com'', retrieved on January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Capitol released another compilation, ''[[Spirit of America (The Beach Boys album)|Spirit of America]]'', which also sold well. With these compilations, The Beach Boys became relevant again, propelling themselves from being the opening act for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] to headliners selling out basketball arenas. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named The Beach Boys the &quot;Band of the Year&quot; for 1974, solely for the their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier.

Manager Jack Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after ''Holland''{{'}}s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973. Blondie Chaplin also left the band in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). Ricky Fataar stayed until fall 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' [[Joe Walsh]]. Chaplin's replacement, [[James William Guercio]], started offering the group career advice that turned out to be so smart and sensible that eventually he became the band's new manager. Under Guercio, The Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit &quot;[[Wishing You Were Here]]&quot;. Beach Boy vocals were also heard on [[Elton John]]'s 1974 hit &quot;[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]&quot;.

Nostalgia had settled into The Beach Boys' hype; the group had not officially released any albums of new material since 1973's ''Holland''. While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from contemporary presentation/oldies encores to an entire show composed of mostly pre-1967 music. Performances of ''Smiley Smile'' to ''Holland'' material was phased out and replaced by their hits of 1961–66, which frustrated serious fans of the band for many years.

===Brian Wilson's return===
''[[15 Big Ones]]'' (1976) marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group in that it was the first album he produced since ''Pet Sounds''. This album included several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including &quot;[[Rock and Roll Music]]&quot; (which made number five), &quot;[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]&quot;, and &quot;[[In the Still of the Night (1956 song)|In the Still of the Night]]&quot;. Brian and Love's &quot;[[It's OK (The Beach Boys song)|It's OK]]&quot; was yet another return to their earlier &quot;summertime fun&quot; style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an [[NBC]] TV special, telecast in August 1976, simply titled &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, which was produced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]] and featured appearances by ''SNL'' cast members [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]].

For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian Wilson spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next LP ''[[Love You (album)|Love You]]'', a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more &quot;fun&quot; songs (&quot;[[Honkin' Down the Highway]]&quot;), a mature love song (&quot;[[The Night Was So Young]]&quot;)—a mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Despite its flaws, ''Love You'' is one of the more popular offerings in The Beach Boys' later oeuvre. Many sources cited the album as a return to the group's roots.

After ''Love You'', Brian's contributions began to decline over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. His appearances with the band in concert diminished. His performances became erratic, his recordings uninspired. Despite the much-publicized &quot;Brian's Back&quot; campaign in the late '70s, most critics believed the group was past its prime, and that Brian Wilson would be the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties. The Beach Boys' last release on Reprise, ''[[M.I.U. Album]]'' (1978), was recorded at [[Maharishi International University]] in Iowa at the insistence of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions to the project; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian appearing as &quot;Executive Producer&quot;. Regardless, despite a handful of interesting tracks, ''M.I.U.'' was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the album.

At the same time of the ''M.I.U. Album'' release, The Beach Boys signed with [[CBS Records]]. They received a substantial advance and reportedly agreed to a guaranteed minimum of one million dollars per album. However, CBS was not satisfied with preliminary reviews of their first product—''[[L.A. (Light Album)]]''. The band realized at this point that Brian either could not or would not write and produce the required material. As a stop-gap measure, Bruce Johnston returned to the group as both a member and a producer. The Brian and Carl song &quot;[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]&quot; became a US top 40 single. The album featured outstanding performances by both Dennis (cuts intended for his second solo effort ''[[Dennis_Wilson#Bambu|Bambu]]'') and Carl (&quot;[[Full Sail (song)|Full Sail]]&quot;). The group also enjoyed moderate success (if not indifferently received) with a disco reworking of the song &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, originally on the ''Wild Honey'' album.

In 1980, the band recorded and released ''[[Keepin' the Summer Alive]]''. Again, Johnston was in the producer's role as well as performing on the album. Brian contributed some inspired production ideas occasionally as seen in the television special the band made for the album's release. Even though Dennis Wilson was credited (his drumming is heard on the group's cover version of Chuck Berry's &quot;[[School Days (song)|School Days]]&quot;), this was the first Beach Boys album not to feature him (due to his ongoing personal problems). He was not in the ''Going Platinum'' television special and was asked not to participate in the recording. Carl Wilson had discovered a young talented drummer, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist by the name of [[Scott Mathews]] and though Mathews was signed to Capitol, Carl asked him to join the band. Mathews jumped at the chance to record with his long-time heroes but ultimately chose not to join the band because of his blossoming career as a producer and songwriter, and a dislike for touring.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

From 1980 through 1982, The Beach Boys and [[The Grass Roots]] performed Independence Day concerts at the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;July 4: Day of Music, Parades, Fireworks&quot;, ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., July 3, 1982, p.

Meanwhile, Dennis Wilson's personal problems continued to escalate, and on December 28, 1983, he drowned while diving from a friend's boat, trying to recover items he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. Despite his death, The Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act. On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington (the day's historic achievement was recorded in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]). They also appeared nine days later at the [[Live Aid]] concert. That year, they released the eponymous album ''[[The Beach Boys (album)|The Beach Boys]]'' and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as [[David Lee Roth]]'s hit version of &quot;California Girls&quot;. In 1987, they played with the [[Hip hop music|rap]] group [[The Fat Boys]], performing the song &quot;[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]&quot; and filming a video for it.

In 1988, they scored their first number-one hit single in 22 years with &quot;[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]&quot;, which was written for the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', becoming their biggest-selling hit ever. It was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Scott McKenzie]], Mike Love, and [[Terry Melcher]]. Riding on &quot;Kokomo&quot;'s steam, The Beach Boys quickly put out the album ''[[Still Cruisin']]'', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976. In 1990, the band, with the help of studio musicians, recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]''. Actor [[John Stamos]] later appeared behind the drums in the &quot;Problem Child&quot; music video and later appeared singing lead vocals on &quot;Forever&quot; (written by Dennis Wilson) on their 1992 album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]''.

Members of the band appeared on television shows such as ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', and ''[[Baywatch]]'' in the late 1980s and 1990s, as well as touring regularly. In 1995, Brian Wilson appeared in the critically acclaimed documentary ''[[I Just Wasn't Made for These Times]]'', which saw him performing for the first time with his now-adult daughters, [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and [[Carnie Wilson|Carnie]] of the group [[Wilson Phillips]]. The documentary also included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the '60s, '70s and '80s. In 1996, The Beach Boys guested with [[Status Quo]] on a re-recording of &quot;[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]&quot;, which was a British Top 30 hit.

For the Summer Tour of 1997, Carl chose to travel and perform with the band, despite his medical burdens. After years of heavy smoking, Carl Wilson succumbed to lung and brain cancer on February 6, 1998 after a long battle with the disease. Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continue to tour as the Beach Boys; Brian Wilson and Al Jardine have developed new bands. David Marks has had a steady solo career. Each of their tours remain reliable draws. (Wilson and Jardine are both still legally members of the Beach Boys organization).

On June 13, 2006, the major surviving Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks) gathered for a celebration of the 40th anniversary of ''Pet Sounds'' and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]'', in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts to all major members, with Brian Wilson accepting on behalf of his late brothers. On August 21, 2010 the Beach Boys opened for Bryan Adams at Empire Field in Vancouver, BC for the 100th year of the PNE.

===Possible 50th anniversary reunion===
In June 2010, the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' reported that Brian Wilson would join The Beach Boys for their 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mike Love talks Beach Boys’ 50th anniversary, possible Brian Wilson reunion|first=Robin|last=Leach|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jun/17/mike-love-talks-beach-boys-50th-anniversary-brian-/|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=June 21, 2010|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Love subsequently stated, &quot;At this time there are no plans for my cousin Brian to rejoin the tour...We have had some discussions of writing and possibly recording together, but nothing has been planned...I..felt the need to clarify that there are no current 'reunion' tour plans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Love Statement on 50th Anniversary

That July, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine reported that Jardine stated &quot;we’re definitely doing at least one show&quot; in 2011 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the formation of the band. The reunion would feature all the surviving sixties-era Beach Boys— Jardine himself, Wilson, Love, Johnston and possibly Marks. Jardine added that the tension between various former band-mates has been resolved. Regarding the various now-resolved lawsuits between them, he noted that &quot;Once we finished our business, all the negativity was gone.&quot; ''Rolling Stone'' reported that Wilson's manager, Jean Sievers, is &quot;unfamiliar with reunion plans&quot;, although the magazine stated &quot;a source close to Love says there have been discussions for reunion concert, but nothing is set.&quot; There was also no confirmation of a location for the concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/183831|title=Beach Boys Consider Reunion For 50th Anniversary|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Jardine joined the Beach Boys for the first time since 1999 at a tribute for Ronald Reagan on February 5, 2011. Brian Wilson was invited to join as well, though he didn't attend, as he was recording his Disney album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kluv.radio.com/2011/02/05/al-jardine-reunites-with-the-beach-boys-tonight-partially/ Al Jardine Reunites With The Beach Boys Tonight – Partially!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court battles==
Many legal difficulties developed from Brian Wilson's psychological problems. In the early 1980s, the band hired controversial therapist [[Eugene Landy]] in an attempt to help Wilson. Landy did achieve some significant improvements in Wilson's overall condition; from his own admissions about his massive drug intake, it was highly likely that Wilson would have died if Landy had not intervened. Landy successfully treated Wilson's drug dependence, and by 1988 Wilson had recovered sufficiently to record his first solo album, ''Brian Wilson''. But Landy became increasingly possessive of his star patient. After accusations that Landy was using his control over Wilson for his own benefit, the band successfully entreated the courts to separate Landy from Wilson.

In addition to the challenges over the use of the band's name and over the best way to care for Wilson, there have been three significant legal cases involving The Beach Boys in recent years. The first was Wilson's suit to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, [[Sea of Tunes]], which he had signed away to his father in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25&amp;nbsp;million for unpaid royalties.

The second lawsuit stemmed from Wilson's reclamation of his publishing rights. Soon after Wilson won his Sea of Tunes case in 1989, Love discovered Murry Wilson did not properly credit him as co-writer on dozens of popular Beach Boys songs. With Love and Brian Wilson unable to determine exactly what Mike was properly owed, Love sued Wilson in 1992 to gain credit for his co-authorship of a number of important Beach Boys songs, winning $13&amp;nbsp;million in 1994 for lost royalties. In interviews, Love revealed that on some songs he wrote most of the lyrics, on others only a line or two. Even though Love sued Wilson, both parties said in interviews that there was no malice between them; they simply couldn't come up with an agreeable settlement by themselves.

However in November 2005, Love filed yet another lawsuit against Wilson and his management. Love alleged that Wilson’s representatives and the UK publication ''[[Daily Mail|The Mail on Sunday]]'' gave the false impression to readers that their joint promotional giveaway of nearly three million copies of the ''Good Vibrations'' CD was authorized by Love and The Beach Boys. This free CD, Love alleged, includes five of Love and Wilson’s co-authored hit Beach Boys songs, and was done to promote Wilson's solo CD, ''[[Smile (Brian Wilson album)|Smile]]''. Love also claimed that ''Smile'' and ''Good Vibrations'' were marketed using The Beach Boys’ names and images without permission. The complaint sought several million dollars in damages, and also a million dollars to cover costs of advertising to correct the perceived &quot;damage to the band's reputation&quot;. Love stated at the time: &quot;Once again the people around Brian... have used him for their own financial gain without regard to his rights, or my rights, or even the rights of the estates of his deceased brothers, Carl and Dennis, and their children... Unfortunately, history repeats itself. Because of Brian’s mental issues he has always been vulnerable to manipulation. I simply want to stop the infringers and stop the deception!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;&gt;[http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article327663.ece Brian Wilson and Mike Love: More bad vibrations], ''independent.co.uk'', retrieved on January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been speculation that Love's lawsuit was an attempt to pressure Wilson into agreeing to let him continue to use the profitable Beach Boys name for his and Johnston's touring efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;/&gt; Wilson's lawyers suggested in legal filings that Love was seeking to assert as personal claims the rights of the corporate holder of The Beach Boys trademark, Brother Records International, in which Love and Wilson are both shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Love v. Mail on Sunday and Brian Wilson, U.S. District Court, Cent. Dist. CA, civil no. 2:05-7798, 2007 WL 4928035 (Westlaw citation, available by subscription).&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson’s website listed the following statement in response: &quot;The lawsuit against Brian is meritless. While he will vigorously defend himself he is deeply saddened that his cousin Mike Love has sunk to these depths for his own financial gain.&quot;

Love's 2005 lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in May 2007 as to all the defendants, including Wilson. In a series of rulings, the court rejected all of Love's claims, including the claim that ''Smile'' was a Beach Boys project as to which Love deserved compensation from Wilson directly.&lt;ref&gt;Love v. Mail On Sunday and Brian Wilson, et als., U.S. District Court, Cent. Dist. CA, civil no. 2:05-7798, docket entries 193 (opinion) and 197 (modified judgment May 29, 2007). In paragraph 1 of his original complaint, Love stated that &quot;This action arises out of an international advertising and marketing scheme organized and orchestrated by Brian Wilson and his agents to promote the release of The Beach Boys’ long-awaited Smile album, at the expense of fellow Beach Boy Mike Love and The Beach Boys corporate entity, Brother Records, Inc. (“BRI”).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The court subsequently ruled that Love had to pay the legal fees of all the defendants as well.&lt;ref&gt;Id., 2008 WL 4678714 (9th Cir. Court of Appeals, reply brief of Brian Wilson) at pp. 27–28, summarizing District Court orders (Westlaw citation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Wilson was inducted into the UK Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5338196.stm Led Zeppelin make UK Hall of Fame], ''bbc.co.uk'', retrieved on January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] ranked the Beach Boys #12 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher = Rolling Stone| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Beach Boys were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;vocal hall&quot; /&gt;

The group's 1966 releases—''Pet Sounds'' and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;—frequently rank among critics' lists of the greatest albums and singles of all time. ''Pet Sounds'' is on the greatest-albums lists ''Time'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/ | work=Time | title=The All-TIME 100 Albums}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[New Musical Express]]'', ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', and ''[[The Times]]''. The record was profoundly influential on The Beach Boys' contemporaries; [[Paul McCartney]] named it one of his favorite albums of all time (with &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot; as his all-time favorite song). McCartney has frequently said that it was the inspiration behind the seminal Beatles' album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Echoing this sentiment, Beatles producer George Martin is quoted saying, &quot;Pepper was an attempt to equal ''[[Pet Sounds]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Abbott, Kingsley | title=''The Beach Boys Pet Sounds: The Greatest Album of the Twentieth Century''| publisher=[[Helter Skelter Pub.]] (London)| year=2001 | isbn=1-9000924-30-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wilsons' Hawthorne, California house, where the Wilson brothers grew up and the group began, was demolished in 1986 to make way for [[Interstate 105 (California)|Interstate 105]], the Century Freeway.  A [[Beach Boys Historic Landmark]] (California Landmark #1041 at 3701 West 119th Street), dedicated on May 20, 2005, marks the location. The Beach Boys continue to tour; a backing band accompanies original member Mike Love and long-time member Bruce Johnston. Former member [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] and &quot;honorary Beach Boy&quot; [[John Stamos]]  make guest appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachboysband.net Beachboysband.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Beatrix Potter''' (28&amp;nbsp;July 1866&amp;nbsp;– 22&amp;nbsp;December 1943) was an English author, [[illustrator]], [[mycology|mycologist]] and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] best known for children's books featuring [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characters such as in ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' which celebrated the British landscape and rural lifestyle.

Born into a privileged household, Potter, along with her younger brother, Walter Bertram, grew up with few friends outside her large extended family. As children they had numerous pets and spent holidays in the south of England, in Scotland, and in the English [[Lake District]]. There she developed a love of the natural world which she closely observed and painted from an early age.  Her parents were artistic and interested in nature and the out of doors. While Beatrix was happily never sent off to boarding school, her education in languages, literature, science and history was broad and she was an eager student.  Although she was provided with private art lessons, Beatrix preferred to develop her own style, particularly favoring watercolor.  In her twenties, she concentrated on the study of fungi [[mycology]], of ancient artifacts [[archeology]], and of [[geology]], and achieved a measure of respect from the scientific establishment for her reproduction of fungi spores and her scientific illustrations.  In her thirties, Potter published the highly successful children’s book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' publishing it privately, and then in 1902 as a small, three-color illustrated book with [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]].  Between 1902 and 1918 she published over twenty popular children’s books.

With the proceeds from the books and a small legacy from an aunt, Potter bought [[Hill Top Farm]] in Near Sawrey, a tiny village in the English Lake District near Ambleside.  Over the next several decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913 at the age of 47 she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from Hawkshead.  Potter became a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation.  She continued to write and illustrate children's’ books for Warne after her marriage until the duties of land management and diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.  Beatrix Potter published over twenty-three books; the best are those written between 1902 and 1918.  Potter died on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, Near Sawrey, leaving almost all of her property to [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now comprises the Lake District National Park.

Potter’s books continue to sell throughout the world, in multiple languages.  Her stories have been retold in song, film, ballet and animation.

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[Image:Young Beatrix.jpg|thumb|left|Potter at fifteen years with her [[English Springer Spaniel|springer spaniel]], Spot]]
Potter's paternal ancestors were [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] from [[Glossop]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Her father, Rupert William Potter (1832–1914), son of the industrialist and [[Member of Parliament]], [[Edmund Potter]], was educated in [[Manchester]] and trained as a [[barrister]] in London. He married Helen Leech (1839–1932), the daughter of a cotton merchant, at [[Gee Cross]] on 8 August 1863. The couple settled in London, living on inherited wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, p. 10-20&lt;/ref&gt; They bought a home in Bolton Gardens [[South Kensington]], where Helen Beatrix was born on 28 July 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatrix was educated at home  by several private [[governess]]es with occasional excursions to public gardens, markets, and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. A brother, Walter Bertram, was born in 1871.

On childhood holidays in rural Scotland and the north of England, she sketched and kept small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians as pets, sometimes taking them from the wild and contributing to their deaths by disregarding their needs. Some were boiled and their skeletons reconstructed. Ruth MacDonald writes, &quot;This willingness to capture wild animals, either on paper or in a cage, is characteristic of Potter's frame of mind ... to intrude herself on nature was a part of her need to master her surroundings, to exert what little power and possession she could, given that her parents were determined to keep her powerless and impoverished.&quot;  MacDonald observes that later in life, Potter &quot;could admire nature without intruding herself upon it or destroying it. But until that point in her life where she felt herself in control, the reader of her journal and the student of her work notes this willingness to destroy, by dissection or disruption, the nature she found around her, to sacrifice it in the pursuit of her art or ownership.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;
Potter matured into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed her to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their home.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific aspirations and work on fungi===
Potter's parents discouraged higher education, but Potter longed to lead a life independent of her parents and considered mycology as career, inspired perhaps by her acquaintance with [[Charles McIntosh]], a Scottish mycologist she met while summering in [[Perthshire]]. Her uncle tried to introduce her as a student at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]] at [[Kew]], but she was rejected because she was a woman.  Potter was later one of the first to suggest that [[lichens]] were a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship between [[fungi]] and [[algae]]. As, at the time, the only way to record microscopic images was by painting them, Potter made numerous drawings of lichens and fungi.  As the result of her observations, she was widely respected throughout England as an expert [[mycology|mycologist]]. She also studied [[spore]] [[germination]] and life cycles of fungi. Potter's set of detailed watercolours of fungi, numbering some 270 completed by 1901, is in the [[Armitt Library]], [[Ambleside]].

In 1897, her paper &quot;On the Germination of Spores of Agaricineae&quot; was presented to the [[Linnean Society]] by her uncle Sir [[Henry Enfield Roscoe]], as women were barred from attending meetings. (In 1997, the Society issued a posthumous official apology to Potter for the way she had been treated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dent|first=Jackie|title=An insider's guide to Beatrix Potter|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/05/InsidersguidePotter/index.html|accessdate=13 June 2010|newspaper=cnn.com|date= 1616 GMT (0016 HKT), December 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Society]] also declined to publish at least one of her technical papers. She lectured at the [[London School of Economics]] several times.

===Literary career===
[[File:Peter Rabbit first edition 1902a.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition, 1902]]

Potter had drawn, for her own enjoyment, illustrations for [[Joel Chandler Harris|Joel Chandler Harris's]] ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories,&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Potter, Artist and Illustrator, Anne Stevenson Hobbs, Frederick Warne &amp; Co Limited 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and she was probably inspired by these as well as by the European tradition of animal fables going back to [[Aesop]].

When she was 27 and on holiday in Scotland, in a letter dated 4 September 1893 she sent a picture and story about rabbits to Noel Moore, the five-year-old son of her last governess, [[Annie Carter Moore]].  Moore was the first to recognise the literary and commercial value of Potter's work and encouraged her to publish the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lear, Linda |year=2002 |title=Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] |isbn=978-0-312-37796-0 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She borrowed back the letter in 1901, developed and expanded the tale, and made it into the book titled ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit|The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden]]''. She sent her tale to six publishers, but was rejected by all of them because of the lack of colour pictures, which were popular at the time. In September 1901, she decided to self-publish and distribute 250 copies of a renamed ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''. Later that year she finally attracted the publisher [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]]. The publishing contract was signed in June 1902 and, by the end of the year, 28,000 copies were in print. In 1903, Beatrix Potter registered her Peter Rabbit doll at the Patent Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lear&quot;/&gt;

She followed ''Peter Rabbit'' with ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' in 1903, also based on a letter to one of the Moore children. Such was the popularity of these and subsequent books that she earned an independent income.

She became secretly engaged to the publisher, [[Norman Warne]] in 1905, but her parents were set against her marrying a tradesman. This caused a breach between Beatrix and her parents.&lt;ref&gt;Lear L. Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature, Macmillan, 2008 ISBN 0312377967, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the engagement, Warne died  of [[pernicious anemia]].  Of his death she wrote in a letter to his sister, Millie, &quot;He did not live long, but he fulfilled a useful happy life. I must try to make a fresh beginning next year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterrabbit.com/ Peterrabbit.com], Frederick Warne &amp; Co Limited 2002. Retrieved February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, Potter wrote 23 small format children's books. Part of their popularity was due to the quality of her illustrations: the animal characters are full of personality, but are deeply based in natural actions.  Her artistic efforts declined around 1920 because of poor eyesight. ''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'' was published in 1930; however, the actual manuscript was one of the first to be written and much predates this publication date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Egoff, Sheila ''et al.'' (ed.)|title=Only Connect: Readings on Children's Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life: the Lake District and conservation===
[[File:Potterhome.jpg|thumb|Potter's [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top]] farm]]
In July 1905, Potter purchased [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top Farm]] in the village of [[Sawrey]] in [[Lancashire]], (now [[Cumbria]]), in the Lake District.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson07&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Beatrix Potter, Conservationist|journal=American Scientist|year=2007|volume=95|author=Thomson, Keith Stewart|pages=210–212|doi=10.1511/2007.65.376|ref=harv|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She loved the landscape, and visited the farm as often as she could, discussing the set-up with farm manager John Cannon.  She went on to buy more land in the area, a venture through which she met William Heelis, six years her junior, whom she married in 1913,&lt;ref name = &quot;NationalTrust&quot;&gt;The National Trust, [http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-places_collections/w-collections-main/w-collections-beatrix_potter/w-collections-feature_1-2.htm &quot;The Story of Beatrix Potter&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; and she went on to become a sheep breeder.&lt;ref name = &quot;NationalTrust&quot;/&gt;  Her letters of the time reflect her increasing concerns with her sheep, preservation of farmland, and World War I.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Jane Crowell Morse (ed.), Beatrix Potter's Americans: Selected Letters, Horn Book, Inc., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

When she died in 1943, In her will, Potter left almost all of her property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] &amp;ndash; {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land, cottages, and 15 farms. The legacy has helped ensure that the [[Lake District]] and the practice of [[fell farming]] remain unspoiled. Her properties now lie within the [[Lake District National Park]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NationalTrust&quot;/&gt; The Trust's 2005 [[Swindon]] headquarters are named &quot;Heelis&quot; in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New central office |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-trust/w-thecharity/w-new_central_office.htm| work=National Trust Official Website |publisher=National Trust |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilltop was opened to visitors in 1946, and displayed her original artwork there until 1985. She left the original illustrations for almost all of her books to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1996, pp. 208–11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peter Rabbit'' is owned by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]]., ''The Tailor of Gloucester'' is owned by the [[Tate Gallery]], and the ''Flopsy Bunnies'' is owned by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Judy |year=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller and Countrywoman |publisher=Frederick Warne |isbn=0-7232-4175-9|pages=208–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, Frederick Warne &amp; Co. granted [[Beswick Pottery]] of [[Longton, Staffordshire]] &quot;rights and licences to produce&quot; the Potter characters in porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Dubay 2006, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beatrix Potter Gallery]], a [[art gallery|gallery]] run by the National Trust and situated in a 17th-century [[Lake District]] [[townhouse]] (once the office of William Heelis) in [[Hawkshead]], [[Cumbria]], England, now displays her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatford&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Gatford, Hazel |year=2004 |title=Beatrix Potter: Her art and inspiration |publisher=The National Trust |isbn=1-84359-105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beatrix Potter Gallery |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-beatrixpottergallery/ |publisher=National Trust |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes  ==
Katherine Chandler expresses  her view in “Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix”  that Potter, unlike most Victorian writers of children's books, wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour. Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales, and that Potter's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty, yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the moral of the tale.  Chandler quotes literary scholar of [[modernism]] [[Humphrey Carpenter]], &quot;there is nothing in [Potter's] work that resembles the moral tale. In fact it might be argued that she is writing something pretty close to a series of immoral tales&quot;. In addition Chandler notes that Potter's economic use of prose presages modernism, comparing her writing to that of [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Chandler, Katherine | year=2007 |title= Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix |journal= Children's Literature Quarterly |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume= 32|issue=4|pages =287–307 |doi= 10.1353/chq.2007.0052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes in ''Secret Gardens The Golden Age of Children's Literature'' that Potter's work shows thematic shifts from the early work onward. ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' shows a type of Jack-the-Giant-Killer theme, in which a small creature confronts a large creature, carried out in the next few books. She then shifts to a utopian theme of nature-as-redemption, followed by a third thematic shift with social pretensions and conventions becoming primary against a background of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, 145-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and fictionalisations==
In 1936, [[Walt Disney]] wanted to make a film about Peter Rabbit, but Potter refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lear&quot;&gt;[http://www.bpotter.com/Chronology.aspx Beatrix Potter chronology on Linda Lear's website].Retrieved 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;  Her works remained printed only almost until the copyright was due to expire, decades after Potter's death.

In 1982, the [[BBC]] produced ''The Tale of Beatrix Potter''. This dramatisation of her life was written by [[John Hawkesworth (producer)|John Hawkesworth]] and directed by Bill Hayes.  It starred [[Holly Aird]] and [[Penelope Wilton]] as the young and adult Beatrix respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tale of Beatrix Potter|url=http://www.uk.imdb.com/title/tt0264081/|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, ''[[The Tales of Beatrix Potter]]'' directed by [[Reginald Mills]] was released.  Several of the ''Tales'' were set to music, with [[choreography]] by [[Frederick Ashton]] and it featured dancers from the [[Birmingham Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]], London, dancing in animal costumes to the musical score of [[John Lanchbery]] performed by the Orchestra of the [[Royal Opera House]].

In 2006, ''[[Miss Potter]]'', a [[biopic|biographical film]] starring [[Renée Zellweger]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Potter|url=http://www.uk.imdb.com/title/tt0482546/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mystery writer  [[Susan Wittig Albert]] is publishing an eight volume series featuring a fictionalised Beatrix Potter in &quot;The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot; focusing on the period of her life she lived in the Lake District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cottage Tales|url=http://www.cottagetales.com/books/index.shtml|publisher=Susan Wittig Albert|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liberal Party''' was one of the two major political parties of the [[United Kingdom]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a third party of negligible importance throughout the latter half of the 20th Century, before merging with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] in 1988 to form the present day [[Liberal Democrats]]. The party was generally considered to be on the [[centre-left]] of the political spectrum, and advocated [[classical liberalism]].

It grew out of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]] in 1859, and [[William Gladstone]] carried the party through governments in the late 19th century. The party split over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], but returned to power in 1906 through a landslide victory. During this time in government, the Liberals are credited with the so-called [[Liberal welfare reforms|Liberal Reforms]], which saw the creation of a basic [[welfare state]]. During World War I, the Liberals governed Britain through a coalition with the Conservatives, which ended in 1922. In the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] permanently replaced the Liberals as Britain's main centre-left party, and the Liberals went into decline, which culminated in them winning as few as 6 seats at general elections during the 1950s. A comeback of sorts was seen during the 1960s and 1970s, but it was not until 1981, when the Liberals allied with the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]], that the party enjoyed significant electoral success. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the alliance took 25% of the popular vote, but this only translated into 23 seats. During 1988, the Liberals formally merged with the SDP to form the Liberal Democrats, though a small splinter [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] was formed in 1989 by former members opposed to the merger.

==Ideology==
During the 19th century the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called [[classical liberalism]]: supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies such as [[free trade]] and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed '[[Gladstonian Liberalism]]' after the [[Victorian era]] Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of [[the Crown]] and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]]) and an extension of the electoral [[Suffrage|franchise]]. Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about [[liberalism]] in 1872:

[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|right|A crowd waits outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the [[1880 general elections]].]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this—that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world...It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (31 December 1872), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The political terms of &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;new&quot; Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the recent tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Greenleaf, ''The British Political Tradition. Volume II: The Ideological Heritage'' (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century the Liberals stance began to shift towards &quot;New Liberalism&quot;, what would today be called [[social liberalism]]: a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/higher/history/liberal/impact1_rev.shtml |title=Education Scotland – Higher Bitesize Revision – History – Liberal – Impact: Revision 1 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] and his Chancellor [[David Lloyd George]], whose [[Liberal reforms]] in the early 1900s created a basic [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev1.shtml |title= BBC&amp;nbsp;— GCSE Bitesize&amp;nbsp;— History &amp;#124; Modern World History &amp;#124; Britain 1905–1951 &amp;#124; The Liberal reforms 1906–1914 |accessdate= 2009-02-28 |work= GCSE Bitesize |publisher= BBC |quote= One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906–1914.

David Lloyd George adopted a programme at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] entitled ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', although by this stage the Liberals had declined to third-party status. The Liberals now (as expressed in the Liberal Yellow Book) regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] extremists.&lt;ref&gt;Liberal Industrial Inquiry, ''Britain's Industrial Future'' (London, 1928), p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and 50s, the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of [[Jo Grimond]] in the 1960s, by positioning itself as a [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] non-[[socialism|socialist]] alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libdemmanifesto.com/1964/1964-liberal-manifesto.shtml |title=1964 Liberal Party manifesto |publisher=Libdemmanifesto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:palmerston.jpg|thumb|left|Viscount Palmerston]]

The Liberal Party grew out of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], which had its origins as an [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] faction in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of The Crown and increasing the power of the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of [[democracy]] for its own sake. The great figures of reformist [[Whig (British political party)|Whiggery]] were [[Charles James Fox]] (died 1806) and his disciple and successor [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]. After decades in opposition the Whigs came to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] in 1832.

The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggery but also brought about the Whigs' demise. The admission of the middle classes to the franchise and to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] led eventually to the development of a systematic [[middle class]] liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey's retirement the party was led first by [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], a fairly traditional Whig, and then by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a renegade Irish [[Tory]] and essentially a [[conservatism|conservative]], although capable of radical gestures.

As early as 1839 Russell had adopted the name Liberal Party, but in reality the party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the [[House of Lords]] and [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] in the Commons. The leading Radicals were [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]], who represented the manufacturing towns that had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]]), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business), and above all [[free trade]]. For a century free trade was the one cause which could unite all Liberals.

In 1841 the Liberals lost office to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under Sir [[Robert Peel]], but their period in [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] was short, because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a free trade issue, and a faction known as the [[Peelite]]s (but not Peel himself, who died soon after), defected to the Liberal side. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston and the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. The leading Peelite was [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a zealous reforming [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston's second government.

The Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party, however, while it was dominated by aristocrats, and it was not until the departure of the &quot;Two Terrible Old Men&quot;, Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston's death in 1865 and Russell's retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative interlude (during which the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]] was passed by agreement between the parties), Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the [[National Liberal Federation]] in 1877.

==The Gladstonian era==
[[Image:Acgladstone2.jpg|thumb|right|William Gladstone]]

For the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. The &quot;Grand Old Man&quot;, as he became known, was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] four times and the powerful flow of his rhetoric dominated British politics even when he was out of office. His rivalry with the Conservative leader [[Benjamin Disraeli]] became legendary. Gladstone was a [[High Church]] Anglican and enjoyed the company of aristocrats, but he grew ever more progressive as he grew older: he was, as one wit put it, &quot;a Tory in all but essentials&quot;. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who had grown up as a Whig supporter under the tutelage of Melbourne, became a Conservative in reaction to Gladstone's moralising Liberalism.

Gladstone's great achievements in office were his [[Elementary Education Act 1870|reforms to education]], land reform (particularly in Ireland, where he [[Irish Land Acts|ended centuries of landlord oppression]]), the [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablishment]] of the (Anglican) [[Church of Ireland]] through the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], the introduction of democratic local government, reform allowing the [[secret ballot]] (the [[Ballot Act 1872]]) and [[Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883|removing electoral corruption]], the abolition of patronage in the civil service and the [[Cardwell Reforms|army]], and the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act]] which greatly extended the vote to almost all adult males. Gladstone's reforming tendencies were borne partly out of his visit to [[Lancashire]] during [[Lancashire Cotton Famine|The Cotton Famine]], where he was impressed by [[working class]] qualities. It was during the 1860s that Gladstone became known as 'The People's William'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title='''Access to History''', Government ''and'' Reform: Britain 1815–1918 (Second Edition), page 56–7|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements but did not resist the reality of [[imperialism]]. For example, he approved of the occupation of [[Egypt]] by British forces in 1882.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]] Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Disraeli during a sharp [[recession]]. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]], but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli's pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the [[Midlothian campaign]]. The Liberals won a large majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 election]]. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.

Among the consequences of the [[Third Reform Act]] (1884–85) was the giving of the vote to the Catholic peasants in Ireland, and the consequent creation of an [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] this party won the balance of power in the House of Commons, and demanded [[Irish Home Rule]] as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong [[Liberal Unionist]] faction led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it.

The result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 election]] at the hands of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords. Gladstone finally retired in 1894, and his ineffectual successor, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], led the party to another heavy defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]].

Another consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates, in the absence of any committed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) in to single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] and endorsement from [[trade union]]s. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard: in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer Whigs were selected as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title='''Access to History''', Government ''and'' Reform: Britain 1815–1918 (Second Edition), page 74|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Liberal zenith==
[[Image:Asquith Q 42036.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herbert Henry Asquith]]]]

The Liberals languished in opposition for a decade, while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held power. The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone's personal secretary, [[John Morley]]. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. Harcourt's resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal leaders H.H. Asquith, Edward Grey, and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the &quot;Liberal Imperialists&quot; that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's &quot;methods of barbarism&quot; in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, Arthur Balfour, pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as a new education bill and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs. Campbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[united Kingdom general election, 1906|the greatest election victory]] in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right.

Although he presided over a large majority, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was overshadowed by his ministers, most notably [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] at the Exchequer, [[Edward Grey]] at the Foreign Office, [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Burdon Haldane]] at the War Office and [[David Lloyd George]] at the Board of Trade. An ill Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died later that year. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government's radicalism. Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer, and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by [[Winston Churchill]], a recent defector from the Conservatives.

The Liberals pushed through much legislation, including the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and welfare. It was at this time that a political battle over the so-called [[People's Budget]] resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, being left once again dependent on the [[Irish nationalism|Irish Nationalists]].

As a result Asquith was forced to introduce a new [[Third Home Rule Act|third Home Rule bill]] in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, the Unionist's [[Ulster Volunteers]] led by Sir [[Edward Carson]], launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] and the threat of [[mutiny]] by army officers in Ireland in 1914 (''see [[Curragh Incident]]''). In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]], was of [[Ulster-Scots]] descent. The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914.

The war struck at the heart of everything British Liberals believed in. The party became divided over the distinctly illiberal policies that were introduced under her auspices, including conscription and the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|Defence of the Realm Act]]. Several Cabinet ministers resigned, and Asquith, the master of domestic politics, proved a poor war leader. Lloyd George and Churchill, however, were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old [[pacifism|pacifist]] Liberals out. The poor British performance in the early months of the war forced Asquith to invite the Conservatives into a coalition (on 17 May 1915). This marked the end of the last all-Liberal government. This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it to Lloyd George instead, who became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government largely made up of Conservatives. Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was split once again.

==Liberal decline==
[[Image:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Lloyd George]]]]

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]] [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], &quot;the Man Who Won the War&quot;, led his coalition into another ''[[khaki election]]'', and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]] wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates – this [[The Coalition Coupon|&quot;coupon&quot;]] as it became known was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. Asquith and most of his colleagues lost their seats. Lloyd George still claimed to be leading a Liberal government, but he was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party. In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition, citing in particular the [[Chanak Crisis]] over [[Turkey]] and Lloyd George's corrupt sale of honours amongst other grievances, and Lloyd George was forced to resign. The Conservatives came back to power under Bonar Law and then [[Stanley Baldwin]].

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 elections]] the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons, as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922 Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]] but ominously made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour – a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government, and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience, as well as offering a middle ground that could get support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense. It was a fatal error.

Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left.  [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was forced into a [[united Kingdom general election, 1924|snap election in 1924]], and although his government was defeated, he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives, while others went over to Labour. (Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]], were the sons of Liberal MPs.)

Asquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', largely written for him by the Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the &quot;[[Celtic fringe]]&quot;, where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the [[alternative vote]], but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice-versa.

==The splits over the National Government==
[[Image:Gws samuel 01.jpg|thumb|140px|Herbert Samuel]]
In 1931 MacDonald's government fell apart under the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and the Liberals agreed to join his [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], dominated by the Conservatives. Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join. Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but only a few MPs and candidates followed. Another group under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk – the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]] (officially the &quot;National Liberals&quot; after 1947) led by Simon, also known as &quot;Simonites&quot;, and the &quot;Samuelites&quot; or &quot;official Liberals&quot;, led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.

The official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to [[protectionism]]. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the [[Ottawa Conference|Ottawa Agreement]] on [[Imperial Preference]]. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]], just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as &quot;[[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|independent Liberals]]&quot;. Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as [[Clement Davies]], who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the [[World War II]] and who would lead it after the war.

==Near extinction==
Samuel had lost his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 election]] and the leadership of the party fell to [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Sir Archibald Sinclair]]. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the [[appeasement]] foreign policy of the British government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party's weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the [[Midlothian Campaign]] and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.

In 1940 they joined Churchill's wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as [[Secretary of State for Air]], the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party's lack of importance that they were not included in the [[War Cabinet]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour. By 1951 there were only six MPs; all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies. In 1957 this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent by-election was lost to the Labour Party, which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader [[Megan Lloyd George|Lady Megan Lloyd George]] as its own candidate. The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.

==Liberal revival==
Through the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, [[Bolton]] and [[Huddersfield]], local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town's two seats. [[Jo Grimond]], for example, who became Liberal leader in 1956, was MP for the remote [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the [[Orpington by-election, 1962|Orpington by-election]] of March 1962 which was won by [[Eric Reginald Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Eric Lubbock]]. There,  the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.

The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the [[European Economic Community]]. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.

The new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, [[Jeremy Thorpe]], the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although [[Emlyn Hooson]] held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon [[Clement Davies]] death in 1962, the party lost its other Welsh five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966 the [[Welsh Liberal Party]] formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure&lt;ref&gt;Russell Deacon (2011) History of the Welsh Liberal party, Welsh Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In local elections [[Liverpool]] remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the [[United Kingdom local elections, 1973|elections]] to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973. In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the [[Home Office]] if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing [[proportional representation]] and a change of Prime Minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead a minority Labour government was formed under [[Harold Wilson]] but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]] the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.

Thorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations about his private life. The party's new leader, [[David Steel]], negotiated the [[Lib-Lab pact]] with Wilson's successor as Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of [[proportional representation]] was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson [[John Pardoe]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], who were mutually antagonistic.

==Alliance with Social Democrats==
[[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|right|150px|The symbol of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats.]]
When the Labour government fell in 1979, the Conservatives under [[Margaret Thatcher]] won [[united Kingdom general election, 1979|a victory]] which served to push the Liberals back into the margins. In 1981 defectors from the moderate wing of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]] and [[Shirley Williams]], founded the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. The two parties quickly formed an alliance (which briefly topped the opinion polls before being overtaken by the Tories) and fought the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general elections]] jointly as the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]]. During 1982 and 1983, at the depths of Labour's fortunes under [[Michael Foot]], there was much talk of the Alliance becoming the dominant party of the left and even of Jenkins becoming Prime Minister. In fact, while the Alliance won over 20% of the vote each time, it was still a long way behind Labour in terms of seats and as a result was disbanded after the 1987 election, with the two parties merging the following year to form the [[Liberal Democrats|Social and Liberal Democrats]], who a year after that become the Liberal Democrats.

==Merger with Social Democrats==
{{main|Liberal Democrats (UK)}}

In 1988 the Liberals and Social Democrats merged to create what came to be called the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Over two-thirds of the members, and all the serving MPs, of the Liberal Party joined this party, led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]], and later by [[Paddy Ashdown]] (1988–99), [[Charles Kennedy]] (1999–2006), [[Sir Menzies Campbell]] (2006–07) and [[Nick Clegg]] (incumbent).

Though the merger process was traumatic and the new party suffered a few years of extremely poor poll results, it gradually found much greater electoral success than the Liberal Party had done in the post-war era. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the Liberal Democrats elected 62 MPs to the House of Commons, a far cry from the days when the Liberals had just 5 MPs and Liberalism as a political force had seemed moribund.

As was the case with the Liberal Party for most of the 20th century, the Liberal Democrats face constant questioning about which of the other two parties they are closer to, in particular about which they would support in the event of a [[hung parliament]]. The party is keen to maintain its independent identity however, and argues that the need for a modern Liberal force in British politics has never been greater.

In the 2010 General Election, the Conservative Party won more seats than any other, but not enough to form a majority government. After several days of negotiation, the Liberal Democrats agreed to join the Conservatives as part of a coalition government.

==The post-1988 Liberal Party==
{{main|Liberal Party (UK, 1989)}}
A group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats, including [[Michael Meadowcroft]] (formerly Liberal MP for Leeds West) and Paul Wiggin (who served on [[Local government in Peterborough|Peterborough City Council]] as a Liberal), continued under the old name of &quot;the Liberal Party&quot;. This was legally a new organisation (the headquarters, records, assets and debts of the old party were inherited by the Liberal Democrats), but its constitution asserts it to be the same Liberal party. The party retains minor influence in some local councils. Meadowcroft himself eventually joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007.

The '''Social Democratic Party''' (SDP) was a political party in the [[United Kingdom]] that was created on 26 March 1981 and existed until 1988. It was founded by four senior [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] 'moderates', dubbed the  'Gang of Four': [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Bill Rodgers (politician)|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]]. At the time of the SDP's creation, Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as [[President of the European Commission]], while Williams had lost her seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]]. The four left the Labour Party as a result of policy changes enacted at the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European [[Common Market]]. They also believed that Labour had become too [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and had been infiltrated at [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] level by [[Trotskyist]] factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] and Labour voters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

For the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 General Elections]], the SDP joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]]. After a ballot of members and the passing of a motion at the 1987 Portsmouth conference, the party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats]], although a minority left to form a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]] led by Dr David Owen.

==History==
===Origins===
The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the [[Campaign for Democratic Socialism]] established to support the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]]), but publicly lies in the 1979 [[Dimbleby Lecture]] given by [[Roy Jenkins]] as he neared the end of his [[President of the European Commission|presidency]] of the [[European Commission]]. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], or from a new group driven by European principles of [[social democracy]].

There were long-running claims of corruption and administrative decay within Labour at local level (the North-East of England was to become a cause célèbre),{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  and concerns that experienced and able Labour MPs could be deselected (i.e., lose the Labour Party nomination) by those wanting to put into a safe seat their friends, family or members of their own Labour faction. In some areas, the [[Militant tendency]] were held to be systematically targeting weak local party branches in safe seat areas in order to have their own candidates selected, and thus become MPs.

[[Eddie Milne]] at [[Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth]] (Northumberland) and [[Dick Taverne]] in [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] were both victims of such intrigues during the 1970s, but in both cases there was enough of a local outcry by party members – and the electorate – for them to fight and win their seats as independent candidates against the official Labour candidates.

===March 1973 Lincoln by-election===
In Taverne's case, he had been fighting efforts by the Lincoln [[Constituency Labour Party]] to deselect him largely over his support for British membership of the [[European Union|European Communities]]. In October 1972 he resigned his seat to force a [[Lincoln by-election, 1973|by-election]] in which he fought as a [[Democratic Labour]] candidate against the official party candidate. Taverne won by an unexpectedly large margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lincoln by-election&quot;&gt;John Ramsden and Richard Jay, &quot;Lincoln: Background to Taverne's Triumph&quot; in &quot;By-elections in British Politics&quot;, Macmillan, 1973, pp. 264-315.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the short lived [[Campaign for Social Democracy]] (CFSD) thereafter, and wrote a book about events surrounding the by-election called ''The Future of the Left – Lincoln and After'' (1972). But the CFSD failed to gain nationwide support, and Taverne lost the seat at the October 1974 General Election. Some independent Social Democrats contested the October 1974 and 1979 General Elections, but none were elected.

Taverne's Lincoln by-election campaign was also helped to a lesser degree by problems with the Conservative candidate, [[Monday Club]] chairman [[Jonathan Guinness]]. His suggestion during the by-election that murderers should have razor blades left in their cells so they could decently commit suicide resulted in him being nicknamed &quot;Old Razor Blades&quot; during the campaign. This, combined with considerable Conservative grassroots disquiet over the Club's links to the [[British National Front|National Front]], persuaded some Conservative voters to switch to Taverne in protest as much as tactically to ensure Labour suffered an embarrassing loss. (Guinness had been elected as Chairman specifically to eradicate such links.)

==The Manifesto Group and the split from Labour==
Many original members of the future Social Democratic Party had been members of the [[Manifesto Group]] within the Labour Party. This group opposed what they saw as a leftward shift in Labour policy, the increasing prominence within the party of [[Tony Benn]], and the involvement of trade unions in choosing the leader of the Labour Party. They argued that a new type of political force was needed to challenge the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Further, they opposed the creation of an [[electoral college]] to elect the leader of the Party, who had previously been elected by members of the Parliamentary Labour Party – in particular, the arrangement of block voting by constituency parties and trade unions, with the total votes of a constituency party or trade union being given to a candidate based on a first-past-the-post within that CLP or union, or changed at the discretion of delegates (similar to primary elections in the United States). They were also vehemently opposed to unilateral nuclear disarmament, an increasingly popular policy amongst members of the party.

The final straw for many in the Manifesto Group was the behaviour of former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] at a meeting with them during the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1980|Labour leadership campaign]] to replace [[James Callaghan]]. He bluntly told those assembled to vote for him and answered their questions uninformatively. At the end, one asked him why they should vote for him, and Healey answered &quot;You have nowhere else to go&quot; (to stop the left-winger [[Michael Foot]] from winning). Healey's arrogance convinced many that their days as members of the Labour Party were now over. [[Ivor Crewe]] and [[Anthony King (professor)|Anthony King]] found five defectors who claimed to have voted for Foot in order to saddle Labour with an unelectable leader and make life easier in their new party. One defector, [[Michael Thomas (politician)|Mike Thomas]], said he was tempted to send a telegraph to Healey reading &quot;Have found somewhere else to go&quot;.

Newspapers of the period reported that the announcement of the new party came as a complete shock to MPs from all sides of the Commons, including members of the Manifesto Group, as the 'Gang of Four' had kept their preparations a closely guarded secret. One notable Manifesto Group exception was its secretary, future Defence Secretary [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]], who was the only officer to remain. The story got around that he had refused to join the new party because he feared he would not be able to keep his [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]] seat at a general election; local [[Scottish National Party]] supporters nicknamed him &quot;Chicken George&quot;.

===Creation of the SDP===
The founding members or 'Gang of Four' were [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]], all leading figures within the Labour Party, and all 'moderates'. They announced the new party at a press conference, after outlining their policies in what became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]].

Democratic, Democratic Labour, New Labour and Radical were all mentioned as possible names for the new party, but eventually Social Democratic was settled on because the 'Gang of Four' consciously wanted to mould the philosophy and ideology of the new party on the Social Democracy practised on mainland Europe.

The opening statement of principles contained in the preamble of the party's constitution stated that &quot;The SDP exists to create and defend an open, classless and more equal society which rejects prejudices based upon sex, race, colour or religion&quot;. The constitution set out the establishment of a &quot;Council for Social Democracy&quot; (CSD) which was, in effect, the party's standing conference. Each area party was entitled to elect delegates to the CSD. A number of internal groups flourished within the new party, the most notable of which was the Tawney Society (mirroring the function of the Fabian Society within the Labour Party).

Twenty-eight Labour MPs eventually joined the new party, along with one member of the Conservative Party, [[Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler]]. Williams and Jenkins were not at the time MPs, but were elected to the Commons in by-elections at [[Crosby by-election, 1981|Crosby]] and [[Glasgow Hillhead by-election, 1982|Glasgow Hillhead]] respectively.  Much of the party's initial membership came from the [[Social Democratic Alliance (UK)|Social Democratic Alliance]].  The party also received a boost with the recruitment of former student leaders from outside the Labour Party. These included former Communist Party of Great Britain member [[Sue Slipman]] as well as Conservative party members including [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Adair Turner]], [[Anna Soubry]] and [[Tom Hayhoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Times; Guardian; Daily Telegraph; Sun; Daily Mail; Daily Express; Mirror 12th - 14th August 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the SDP was seen as being largely a breakaway from the right wing of the Labour Party, an internal party survey found that 60% of its members had not belonged to a political party before, with 25% being drawn from Labour, 10% from the Conservatives and 5% from the Liberals.

The party enjoyed a considerable honeymoon period with the press, who made much mileage out of their quirk for proffering [[claret]] at their functions. Claret is an &quot;agreeable&quot; wine, and a metaphor for the party's harmonious internal relations compared to those of the strife-torn Labour Party of the period.

The policies of the SDP emphasised a middle position between perceived extremes of [[Thatcherism]] and the Labour Party. Its constitution argued for &quot;the fostering of a strong public sector and a strong private sector without frequent frontier changes&quot;. The SDP favoured some [[Thatcherite]] reforms during the 1980s, such as legislation aimed at reforming the trade unions (although the parliamentary SDP actually split three ways on Norman Tebbit's 1982 Inudustrial Relations bill, most voting for, some against, and others abstaining), but took a more welfarist position than the Conservative Party, being more sceptical of Conservative welfare reforms (particularly regarding the Health Service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/tim_hames/article532682.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=At last it can be told David Owen was Tony Blairs secret political father | date=13 June 2005 | accessdate=7 April 2010 | first=Tim | last=Hames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the party's first electoral contest, Jenkins narrowly failed to win a [[Warrington by-election, 1981|by-election at Warrington]] in July 1981, describing it as his &quot;first defeat, but by far (his) greatest victory&quot;. In the [[Glasgow Hillhead by-election, 1982|Glasgow Hillhead by-election]] in March 1982, another candidate named Roy Jenkins was nominated by Labour Party activists to contest the seat in order to confuse voters and split his potential vote. SDP polling agents were given special dispensation by the Returning Officer to have placards outside of polling stations to state which one on the ballot papers was the 'real Roy'. Ultimately, the SDP's Jenkins was elected.

A [[Social Democratic Party (UK) leadership election, 1982|leadership election]] was held later in the year, Jenkins beating Owen in the ballot to become the first party leader. Later in the year, Shirley Williams defeated Bill Rogers in the ballot to become SDP president.

===The Alliance===
[[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|right|The symbol of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats.]]
The SDP formed the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] late in 1981, under the joint leadership of Roy Jenkins (SDP) and Liberal leader [[David Steel]]. The Liberal Party, and in particular its leader, [[David Steel]], had applauded the formation of the SDP from the sidelines from the very start. Senior Liberal MP for [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] [[Cyril Smith]] caused some embarrassment, however, by publicly stating that the SDP &quot;should be strangled at birth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/quotations/quotations.php?auth_id=357 |title=Home |publisher=Total Politics |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an era of public disillusionment with the two main parties  – Labour and the Conservatives – and widescale unemployment, the Alliance achieved considerable success in parliamentary by-elections. At one point in late 1981, the party had an opinion poll rating of over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm | work=BBC News | title=SDP: Breaking the mould | date=25 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1981, David Steel was able to address the Liberal Party conference with the phrase &quot;Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3185313.stm | work=BBC News | title=Conference season's greatest hits | date=10 September 2003 | accessdate=7 April 2010 | first=Ollie | last=Stone-Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1982, after public disagreements over who could fight which seats in the forthcoming election, the poll rating dipped, but the party remained ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives. However, following the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]] on April 2, 1982, the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] soared from third to first place in the public opinion polls. The standing of the Alliance and Labour declined. By this stage, however, the Alliance already 30 MP's in parliament - virtually all of them defectors from Labour, joined by just the one Tory MP.

Labour lost [[Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey]], one of their ten safest seats, in a [[Bermondsey by-election, 1983|by-election in February 1983]] to Liberal candidate [[Simon Hughes]]: the sitting Labour MP [[Bob Mellish, Baron Mellish|Robert Mellish]] resigned to work for the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] but, being opposed to the selection by his left-wing [[Constituency Labour Party]] of [[Peter Tatchell]], supported the former leader of [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark council]] John O'Grady as &quot;Real Bermondsey Labour&quot; giving an impression of Labour division and infighting.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the SDP/Liberal Alliance won more than 25% of the national vote, close behind Labour's 28%, but well behind the 44% secured by the Conservatives. However, because of the British &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; electoral system, only 23 Alliance MPs were elected, six of whom were members of the SDP. The party's leader, Roy Jenkins, managed to hold his seat at [[Glasgow Hillhead]], but SDP President Shirley Williams was defeated at Crosby (which she had won in a by-election in November 1981) as a result of unfavourable boundary changes.

The MP for Plymouth Devonport, Dr David Owen (who had been a Labour government minister under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] between 1974 and 1979), took over as SDP leader after the 1983 General Election. He was more sceptical about close relations with the Liberals than his predecessor Roy Jenkins, and favoured retaining the party's distinct identity. Owen's influence ensured that proposals for a merger between the two parties were shelved after a lengthy debate at the SDP's 1983 Conference.

During the 1983-87 parliament some SDP members started to become unsettled at what appeared to be the increasingly right wing course taken by SDP leader David Owen. This resulted in some members launching the Limehouse Group in an attempt to keep the party on the left of centre course that was first propounded in the [[Limehouse Declaration]].

Two more SDP MPs were elected in [[by-election]]s during the 1983-87 parliament, but in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], the Alliance's share of the vote fell to 23%, and the SDP's parliamentary party was reduced from eight members to five. Roy Jenkins was amongst those who lost their seats. [[Mike Hancock (UK politician)|Mike Hancock]] had won a [[Portsmouth South by-election, 1984|by-election at Portsmouth South in 1984]] from the Conservatives which was lost in 1987, but [[Rosie Barnes]], who had won the bitterly contested [[Greenwich by-election, 1987|Greenwich by-election]] in February 1987 from Labour managed to hold on in the June General Election.

From the outset, the formation of the Alliance had raised questions as to whether it would lead to a merged party, or the two parties were destined to compete with each other. This in turn led to grassroots tensions in some areas between Liberal and SDP branches that impaired their ability to mount joint campaigns successfully. Such cross-party feuding was part of the reason for Jenkins losing his Hillhead seat to Labour candidate [[George Galloway]] in 1987.

Liberal pride was damaged by the sustained lampooning of the Alliance by ITV's ''[[Spitting Image]]'' puppet comedy programme portraying Steel as the craven lickspittle of Owen.  One ''Spitting Image'' sketch had a Machiavellian Owen proposing to a simpering Steel that the parties merged under a new name: &quot;and for our side we'll take 'Social Democratic', and from your side, we'll take ‘Party'&quot;, to which a hesitant Steel agreed.

===Merger, disestablishment and splits===
After the disappointment of 1987, Steel proposed a formal merger of the two parties.  Jenkins and Steel had believed this to be eventually inevitable after the party failed to break through at the 1983 election.  The proposal, also supported by Williams and Rodgers, was fiercely opposed by Owen, who argued that such a merger would not be accepted by the electorate, and would not reverse their declining share of the vote.  Jenkins denied that a merger had been his original intent.

But the majority of the SDP's membership (along with those of the Liberals) voted in favour of the union. Owen resigned as leader and was replaced by [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]]. Steel and Maclennan headed the new &quot;Social and Liberal Democrat Party&quot; from 3 March 1988. An interim working name for the party, the &quot;Democrats&quot;, was adopted by conference on 26 September 1988. This proved to be unpopular, and the party was re-named the [[Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989, as had been originally proposed at the September 1988 conference by the party's Tiverton branch.

Most SDP members, including SDP MP and future Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]], joined Maclennan in the merged party, but Owen created a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]], along with two other MPs, [[John Cartwright (UK politician)|John Cartwright]] and [[Rosie Barnes]]. There was also a continuing [[Liberal Party (modern)|Liberal Party]], led by [[Michael Meadowcroft]] and David Morrish, mainly based on Liverpool and West Country Liberals who feared a dilution by the former SDP members of the Liberal tradition within the merged party.

Some members simply dropped out of politics altogether out of disillusionment when the time came to renew their membership subscriptions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} After a series of highly publicised expulsions of [[Militant tendency]] members, the Labour Party led by [[Neil Kinnock]] benefited in the opinion polls from the feuding within the former Alliance. The Liberal Democrats also lost to the continuing SDP its one major backer, [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury]].

The subsequent election of a new Liberal leader, [[Paddy Ashdown]], revived the new party's fortunes in time, and turned it into the most successful &quot;third party&quot; electorally in British politics since the days of Lloyd George. Under David Owen, the [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|SDP continued]] from 1988 to 1990, and [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1990)|subsequently]], but without Owen's involvement.

==Aftermath==
Most members of the SDP who joined the Liberal Democrats have remained in that party. There have been a few exceptions to this, with [[Roger Liddle]] and [[Polly Toynbee]] among those who former Labour Party members of the SDP who  returned to Labour ranks subsequently.  Some Owenites joined the Conservative Party, with one, [[Daniel Finkelstein|Danny Finkelstein]], becoming a close aide of both [[John Major]] and [[William Hague]].

But most important of all, the Social Democratic Party strengthened the political credibility of the Liberals. The national status of Roy Jenkins (former Chancellor and Home Secretary) and David Owen (former Foreign Secretary who had been widely tipped as a future Labour Prime Minister) helped the Liberals become something more than a source of shock by-election results and a party for those living in rural areas such as the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Cornwall]]. The SDP also helped the Liberals attract attention from the media for their policies after a long period when the only media interest in the party resulted from the trial of former Liberal leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]].

The '''Bank of England''' (formally the '''Governor and Company of the Bank of England''') is (despite its name) the [[central bank]] of the whole of the [[United Kingdom]] and is the model on which most modern central banks have been based.  It was established in 1694 to act as the [[Kingdom of England|English]] Government's banker, and to this day it still acts as the banker for [[Her Majesty's Government|HM Government]]. The Bank was privately owned and operated from its foundation in 1694. It was subordinated to the Treasury after 1931 in making policy and was nationalised in 1946.

In 1997 it became an independent public organisation, wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the Government, with independence in setting monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_3806000/3806313.stm BBC On This Day | 6 | 1997: Brown sets Bank of England free], Retrieved on 13 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/index.htm Bank of England | About the Bank], Retrieved on 13 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/parliament/index.htm Bank of England: Relationship with Parliament]. Bank of England. Retrieved on 21 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in [[England and Wales]], although not in [[Bank of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee]] has devolved responsibility for managing the [[monetary policy]] of the country. The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee &quot;if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances&quot; but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980011_en_3#pt2-pb4-l1g19 |title=Act of Parliament gives devolved responsibility to the MPC with reserve powers for the Treasury |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank's headquarters has been located in London's main financial district, the [[City of London]], on [[Threadneedle Street]], since 1734.  It is sometimes known by the metonym ''The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street'' or simply ''The Old Lady''.  The current [[Governor of the Bank of England]] is [[Mervyn King (economist)|Mervyn King]], who took over on 30 June 2003 from [[Edward George|Sir Edward George]].  As well as the London offices, the Bank of England also has secondary offices on King Street in [[Leeds]].

==History==
[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|left|The sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694)]]

England's crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]], became the catalyst to England rebuilding itself as a global power.  England had no choice but to build a powerful navy if it was to regain global power. As there were no public funds available, in 1694 a private institution, the Bank of England, was set up to supply money to the King. £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the Navy.

As a side-effect, the huge industrial effort needed started to transform the economy, from iron works making nails to agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the Royal Navy.  This helped the new United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– [[Acts of Union 1707|England and Scotland were formally united in 1707]]&amp;nbsp;– to become prosperous and powerful.  Together with the power of the navy, this made Britain the dominant world power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://66.102.9.132/search?q=cache:http://www.bbc.co.uk.news-channel.org/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2010/wk2/feature_sea.shtml |title=BBC: Empire of the Seas programme |publisher=66.102.9.132 |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the bank was devised by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], in 1694, to the plan which had been proposed by [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] three years before, but had not been acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;id=EkUTaZofJYEC&amp;dq=British+Parliamentary+reports+on+international+finance&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kHxssmPNow&amp;sig=UyopnsiJSHwk152davCIyQAMVdw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA25,M1 |title=Committee of Finance and Industry 1931 (Macmillan Report) description of the founding of Bank of England  |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}} &quot;Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. '&amp;#39;'Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State'&amp;#39;'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a loan of £1.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as '''The Governor and Company of the Bank of England''' with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes.  The [[Royal Charter]] was granted on 27 July through the passage of the Tonnage Act of 1694.&lt;ref&gt;H. Roseveare, /The Financial Revolution 1660-1760/ (1991, Longman), pp.34&lt;/ref&gt; Public finances were in so dire a condition at the time that the terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a service charge of £4000 per annum for the management of the loan. The first governor was Sir [[John Houblon]], who is depicted in the £50 note issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.

[[File:The Old Lady of Threadneedle St.png|thumb|right|Satirical cartoon protesting against the introduction of paper money, by [[James Gillray]], 1797. The &quot;Old Lady of Threadneedle St&quot; (the Bank personified) is ravished by [[William Pitt the Younger]].]]

The Bank's original home was in Walbrook in the City of London, where during the building's reconstruction in 1954 archaeologists found the remains of a Roman [[Temple of Mithras, London|temple to Mithras]] (Mithras was&amp;nbsp;– rather fittingly&amp;nbsp;– worshipped as being the God of Contracts); the Mithraeum ruins are perhaps the most famous of all twentieth-century Roman discoveries in the City of London and can now be viewed by the public.

===18th century===
In 1734 the Bank of England moved to its current location on Threadneedle Street, and thereafter slowly acquired neighbouring land to create the edifice seen today. Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s rebuilding of the Bank of England, demolishing most of Sir [[John Soane]]'s earlier building was described by architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as &quot;the greatest architectural crime, in the City of London, of the twentieth century&quot;.

When the idea and reality of the [[National Debt]] came about during the 18th century this was also managed by the bank. By the [[charter]] renewal in 1781 it was also the bankers' bank&amp;nbsp;– keeping enough gold to pay its notes on demand until 26 February 1797 when [[French Revolution|war]] had so diminished [[gold reserves]] that the government prohibited the Bank from paying out in gold. This prohibition lasted until 1821.

===19th century===
The 1844 [[Bank Charter Act]] tied the issue of notes to the gold reserves and gave the bank sole rights with regard to the issue of banknotes. Private banks which had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued. A few English banks continued to issue their own notes until the last of them was taken over in the 1930s. The Scottish and Northern Irish private banks still have that right.

===20th century===
Britain remained on the [[gold standard]] until 1931 when the gold and foreign exchange reserves were transferred to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. But their management was still handled by the Bank. In 1997 the bank was given responsibility for interest rate policy.

During the governorship of [[Montagu Norman]], which lasted from 1920 to 1944, the Bank made deliberate efforts to move away from [[commercial bank]]ing and become a central bank. In 1946, shortly after the end of Norman's tenure, the bank was nationalised by the Labour government.

[[Image:City1.jpg|thumb|left|The main Bank of England façade, c. 1980.]]

After 1945 the Bank pursued the multiple goals of Keynesian economics, especially &quot;easy money&quot; and low interest rates to support aggregate demand. It tried to keep a fixed exchange rate, and attempted to deal with inflation and sterling weakness by credit and exchange controls.&lt;ref&gt;John Fforde, ''The Role of the Bank of England, 1941-1958'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the Bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called [[Bank Of England Nominees Limited (BOEN)]], a private limited company, with 2 of its 100 £1 shares issued. According to its Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association, its objectives are:- “To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them....” Bank of England Nominees Limited was granted an exemption by Edmund Dell, Secretary of State for Trade, from the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976 , because, “it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders.” The Bank of England is also protected by its Royal Charter status, and the Official Secrets Act.

[[Image:2POUND1994.jpg|thumb|right|Tercentenary of the Bank of England, commemorated on a 1994 [[British two pound coin]].]]

On 6 May 1997, following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] which brought a Labour government to power for the first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Gordon Brown]], that the Bank of England would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the [[Bank of England Act 1998]] (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee]] was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's stated [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Monetary Policy Dates Since 1990 |publisher=Bank of England |accessdate=20 September 2007 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070629143630/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target has now changed to 2% since the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the treasury's inflation index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remit of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England and the New Inflation Target |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=20 September 2007 |date=10 December 2003 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.

The handing over of monetary policy to the Bank of England had featured as a key plank of the [[Liberal Democrats]]' economic policy since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Liberal Democrat election manifesto, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; A Conservative MP [[Nicholas Budgen]] had also proposed this as a [[Private Member's Bill]] in 1996, but the bill failed as it had neither the support of the government nor that of the opposition.

===21st century===
More recently, in 2007 the Bank of England, in its role as lender of last resort, helped support [[Northern Rock]], a specialist mortgage lender that suddenly became unable to rely on wholesale market borrowing to finance its lending operation following the 2007 [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. The role of supporting [[Northern Rock]], and other UK banks caught up in the late 2000s financial crisis, is now performed by [[UK Financial Investments Limited]], set up by the UK Government. The Bank of England of course still remains lender of last resort in the case of any further unexpected shock to the UK financial system.

==Functions of the Bank==
The Bank of England performs all the functions of a central bank. The most important of these is supposed to be maintaining price stability and supporting the economic policies of the British Government, thus promoting economic growth. There are two main areas which are tackled by the Bank to ensure it carries out these functions efficiently:
[[Image:Bank of England.jpg|right|thumb|Bank House, the Bank of England offices on King Street in [[Leeds]].]]

;Monetary stability
:Stable prices and confidence in the [[currency]] are the two main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by making sure price increases meet the Government's [[inflation]] target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy.
;Financial stability
:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.
The Bank works together with several other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:
* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy.
* The [[Financial Services Authority]], an independent body that regulates the financial services industry.
* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.
The 1997 [[Memorandum of Understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank.

The Bank of England acts as the Government's banker, and as such it maintains the Government's [[Consolidated Fund]] account. It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.

The Bank of England has a [[monopoly]] on the issue of [[banknotes]] in England and Wales. Scottish and [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one to one with deposits in the Bank of England, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its bank note printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997 the [[Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred to the new [[UK Debt Management Office]] in 1998, which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds (known as [[gilts]]) from the Bank at the end of 2004.

The Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking industry, although this responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998.

In order to help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public. It maintains a free museum and runs the [[Target Two Point Zero]] competition for A-level students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Bank of England: Education|accessdate=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank has operated, since January 2009, an Asset Purchase Facility (APF) to buy &quot;high-quality assets financed by the   issue of Treasury bills and the [[UK Debt Management Office|DMO]]'s cash management operations&quot; and thereby improve liquidity in the credit markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;APF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Asset Purchase Facility|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has, since March 2009, also provided the mechanism by which the Bank's policy of [[quantitative easing]] (QE) is achieved, under the auspices of the MPC. Along with the managing the £200&amp;nbsp;billion of QE funds, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are  undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England  Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).&lt;ref name=&quot;APF&quot;/&gt;

{{Ref improve section|date=March 2009}}
The Bank of England has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were &quot;White Notes&quot;, printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between £5 and £1000. The Bank issued notes for ten [[shilling]]s and one pound for the first time on 22 November 1928 when the Bank took over responsibility for these denominations from the Treasury which had issued notes of these denominations three days after the declaration of [[World War I|war in 1914]] in order to remove gold [[coin]]s from circulation.

During the Second World War the German [[Operation Bernhard]] attempted to counterfeit various denominations between £5 and £50 producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original plan was to parachute the money on the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe&amp;nbsp;– although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.

In 2006, a sum in excess of £53&amp;nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm Record £53m stolen in depot raid], BBC, 27 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bakelite''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|eɪ|k|ɨ|l|aɪ|t}} {{USdict|bāk&amp;prime;(ə)līt}}), or '''polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride''', is an early [[plastic]]. It is a [[thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] [[phenol formaldehyde resin]], formed from an [[elimination reaction]] of [[phenol]] with [[formaldehyde]], usually with a [[wood flour]] [[filler]]. It was developed in 1907–1909 by [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] chemist [[Leo Baekeland]].

One of the first [[plastics]] made from synthetic components (although phenol can be extracted from biological sources), Bakelite was used for its electrically [[nonconductor|nonconductive]] and heat-resistant properties in radio and telephone casings and electrical [[insulators]], and also in such diverse products as [[kitchenware]], [[jewellery]], pipe stems, and children's [[toy]]s. In 1993 Bakelite was designated a [[ACS National Historical Chemical Landmarks|National Historical Chemical Landmark]] by  the [[American Chemical Society]] in recognition of its significance as the world's first synthetic plastic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=924&amp;content_id=WPCP_007586&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=d51cb5fc-66c0-4fb1-82c6-6c8660810203  ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark], The Bakelizer (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[retro]]&quot; appeal of old Bakelite products and labor intensive manufacturing has made them quite collectible in recent years.

==History==
Dr. Baekeland had originally set out to find a replacement for [[shellac]] (made from the excretion of lac beetles). Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were polymers, and Baekeland investigated the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde. He first produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called &quot;[[Novolak]]&quot; that never became a market success, then turned to developing a binder for [[asbestos]] which, at that time, was moulded with rubber. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]], he found he could produce his dreamed-of hard mouldable plastic: bakelite.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Amato | first = Ivan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Leo Baekeland | work = Time 100 | publisher = [[TIME]] | date = 29 March 1999 | url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/baekeland.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his invention at a meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] on February 5, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Chemical Substance | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 6, 1909 | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CEFDA1439E733A25755C0A9649C946897D6CF | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bakelite Corporation was formed in 1922 (after patent litigation favorable to Baekeland) from a merger of three companies: the General Bakelite Company, which Baekeland had founded in 1910, the Condensite Company founded by J.W. Aylesworth, and the Redmanol Chemical Products Company founded by L.V. Redman.&lt;ref name=aice&gt;{{cite book | last = American Institute of Chemical Engineers Staff | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Twenty-Five Years of Chemical Engineering Progress | publisher = Ayer Publishing | year = 1977 | location = | pages = 216 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0836901495}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bakelite Limited was formed in 1926 from the amalgamation of three suppliers of phenol formaldehyde materials: the Damard Lacquer Company Limited of [[Birmingham]]; Mouldensite Limited of Darley Dale and Redmanol Chemical Products Company of [[London]]. Around 1928 a new factory opened in [[Tyseley]], Birmingham, England (subsequently demolished in 1998). In 1939 the company was acquired by the [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide and Carbon Corp]]oration.

==Properties==
[[Phenolic resin|Phenolics]] are seldom used in general consumer products today due to the cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature. An exception to this overall decline is their use in small precision-shaped components where their specific properties are required, such as molded disc brake cylinders, saucepan handles, electrical plugs and switches and parts for electrical irons. Today, Bakelite is manufactured and produced in sheet, rod and tube form for hundreds of industrial applications in the [[electronics]], [[power generation]] and [[aerospace]] industries, and under a variety of commercial brand names, including Garolite. 
     
[[Image:RotorBakelite-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bakelite [[distributor]] rotor.]]

Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or glass cloth impregnated with synthetic resin. These layers of laminations are usually of cellulose [[paper]], [[cotton]] fabrics, [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic yarn]] fabrics, [[Glass (fiber)|glass fabrics]] or unwoven fabrics. When heat and pressure are applied to the layers, a chemical reaction ([[polymerization]]) transforms the layers into a high-pressure [[Thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] industrial laminated plastic. When rubbed, original Bakelite has a telltale odor. 

Bakelite Phenolic is produced in dozens of commercial grades and with various additives to meet diverse mechanical, electrical and thermal requirements. Some common types include:
*PAPER REINFORCED PHENOLIC NEMA XX per MIL-I-24768 PBG Normal electrical applications, moderate mechanical strength, continuous [[operating temperature]] of 250°F.
*CANVAS REINFORCED PHENOLIC NEMA C per MIL-I-24768 TYPE FBM NEMA CE per MIL-I-24768 TYPE FBG Good mechanical and impact strength with continuous operating temperature of 250°F.
*LINEN REINFORCED PHENOLIC NEMA L per MIL-I-24768 TYPE FBI NEMA LE per MIL-I-24768 TYPE FEI Good mechanical and electrical strength. Recommended for intricate high strength parts. Continuous operating temperature 250°F.
*NYLON REINFORCED PHENOLIC NEMA N-1 per MIL-I-24768 TYPE NPG Superior electrical properties under humid conditions, fungus resistant, continuous operating temperature of 160°F.

==Applications and usage==
[[Image:Bakelite radio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bakelite radio at Bakelite museum.]]
Although no longer extensively used as an industrial manufacturing material, Bakelite was used in myriad applications including [[saxophone]] mouthpieces, [[whistle]]s, [[Brownie (camera)|cameras]], [[Rickenbacker|solid-body electric guitars]], rotary-dial [[telephone]]s, early [[machine gun]]s, and appliance casings. The thermosetting plastic was at one point considered for the manufacture of [[penny (U.S. coin)|coins]], due to a shortage of traditional manufacturing material. In 1943, Bakelite and other non-metal materials were tested for usage as a [[Cent (United States coin)|penny]] in the United States before the [[United States Mint|Mint]] settled on [[1943 steel cent|zinc coated steel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uspatterns.com/p2073.html J2051/P2073] USPatterns.com. Accessed July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]''. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/31/080331fa_fact_owen Penny Dreadful]. David Owen. March 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakelite was used widely from the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s for jewelry.  Huge quantities of beads, bangles and earrings were produced by the Catalin Company which introduced 15 new colours in 1927, and created marbled and translucent plastics.  The jewelry of this era is now highly collectable.  It was no longer made after the second world war due to expensive production costs.  Jewelry boxes, desk sets, clocks, radios, kitchenware such as canisters and tableware were also made of Bakelite during the 1930s.  

The foremost usage of Bakelite today is as a substitute for [[porcelain]] and other opaque ceramics in applications where fine detail is unimportant (other thermoset resins can capture detail more finely when molded) and durability over traditional ceramic compounds is desired. As such, a main continuing use for Bakelite is in the area of board and tabletop games. Devices such as [[billiard ball]]s, [[domino]]es, [[Mahjongg]] tiles and other gaming tilesets, and movers/pieces for games like [[chess]], [[checkers]], and [[backgammon]] are constructed of Bakelite for the look, durability, fine polish, weight, and sound of the resulting pieces. [[Dice]] are sometimes made of Bakelite for weight and sound, but the majority are made of a thermoplastic such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]].
Bakelite is used to make the presentation boxes of [[Breitling]] watches and sometimes as a substitute for metal [[Magazine (firearms)|firearm magazines]]. Bakelite is also used in the mounting of metal samples in [[metallography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/StructuresMaterials/ASG/MetLab/mounting.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenolic resins have been commonly used in ablative heat shields.  Soviet heatshields for ICBM warheads and spacecraft reentry consisted of asbestos textolite impregnated with Bakelite.&lt;ref&gt;Roads to Space: an oral history of the Soviet space program&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakelite was used to make Kalashnikov rifle magazines, in particular the [[AK-74]], and Soviet military firearm grips.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Image:Painted Pony Bean.JPG|thumb|275px|&quot;Painted Pony&quot; dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)]]

'''Bean''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|iː|n}}) is a common name for large plant [[seed]]s of several [[genus|genera]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Fabaceae]] (alternately Leguminosae) used for human food or [[animal feed]].

The whole young pods of bean plants, if picked before the pods ripen and dry, are very tender and may be eaten cooked or raw.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Thus the term &quot;[[green bean]]s&quot; means &quot;green&quot; in the sense of unripe (many are in fact not green in color). In some cases the beans inside the pods of green beans are too small to comprise a significant part of the cooked fruit.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;bean&quot; originally referred to the seed of the [[Vicia faba|broad bean]], but was later expanded to include members of the genus ''[[Phaseolus]]'', such as the [[common bean]] and the [[runner bean]], and the related genus ''[[Vigna]]''. The term is now applied in a general way to many other related plants such as [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[chickpea]]s (garbanzos), [[vetch]]es, and [[lupin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=no reference for addition}} 

&quot;Bean&quot; can be used as a near-synonym of &quot;[[Pulse (legume)|pulse]]&quot;, an edible [[legume]], though the term &quot;pulses&quot; is usually reserved for leguminous crops harvested for their dry grain and usually excludes crops mainly used for [[oil]] extraction (like soybeans and peanuts) or those used exclusively for [[sowing]] purposes (such as [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]]). Leguminous crops harvested green for food, such as [[snap pea]]s, [[snow pea]]s, and so on, are classified as vegetable crops.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=no reference for addition}} 

In English usage, the word &quot;beans&quot; is also sometimes used to mean the seeds or pods of plants that are not in the family Leguminosae, but which bear a superficial resemblance to true beans, for example [[coffee bean]]s, [[castor bean]]s and [[cocoa beans]] (which resemble bean seeds), and [[vanilla bean]]s (which resemble the pods).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=no reference for addition}}

==History==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}

Beans are one of the longest-cultivated plants. [[Broad beans]], with seeds the size of the small fingernail, were gathered in their wild state in [[Afghanistan]] and the Himalayan foothills.&lt;ref&gt;L. Kaplan, &quot;Legumes in the History of Human Nutrition&quot; ''The World of Soy'', 2008:27ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In a form improved from naturally occurring types, they were already being grown in Thailand since the early seventh millennium BC, predating ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Chester F. Gorman, &quot;Hoabinhian: a pebble-tool complex with early plant associations in Southeast Asia&quot;, ''Science'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; They were deposited with the dead in [[ancient Egypt]]. Not until the second millennium BC did cultivated, large-seeded broad beans appear in the Aegean, Iberia and transalpine Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'' 2000:114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (late 8th century) is a passing mention of beans and [[chickpea]]s cast on the threshing floor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And as in some great threshing-floor go leaping From a broad pan the black-skinned beans or peas&quot; (''Iliad'' xiii, 589).&lt;/ref&gt; 
The oldest-known domesticated beans in the Americas were found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], an archaeological site in [[Peru]], and dated to around the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Chazan p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Beans were an important source of [[Protein in nutrition|protein]] throughout Old and New World history, and still are today. There are over 4,000 [[cultivar]]s of bean on record in the United States alone.

Most of the kinds commonly eaten fresh come from the Americas, being first seen by a European when [[Christopher Columbus]], during his exploration, of what may have been the [[Bahamas]], found them being grown in fields. Five kinds of ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans were domesticated&lt;ref&gt;Domestication, besides involving selection for larger seed size, also involved selection for pods that did not curl and open when ripe, scattering the beans they contained (Kaplan 2008:30)..&lt;/ref&gt; by pre-Columbian peoples: common beans (''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'') grown from Chile to the northern part of what is now the United States, and lima and sieva beans (''[[Phaseolus lunatus]]''), as well as the less widely distributed teparies (''[[Phaseolus acutifolius]]''), scarlet runner beans (''[[Phaseolus coccineus]]'') and polyanthus beans (''[[Phaseolus polyanthus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 2008:30f).&lt;/ref&gt; One especially famous use of beans by pre-Columbian people as far north as the Atlantic seaboard is the &quot;[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]&quot; method of [[companion plant]] cultivation:

:On the east coast of what would come to be called the United States, some tribes would grow [[maize]] (corn), beans, and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] intermingled together, a system which had originated in Mexico. The corn would not be planted in rows as it is today, but in a checkerboard/hex fashion across a field, separate patches of one to four stalks each.

:Beans would be planted around the base of the developing stalks, and would vine their way up as the stalks grew. All American beans at that time were vine plants, &quot;bush beans&quot; having only been bred more recently. The cornstalks would work as a [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] for the beans, and the beans would provide much-needed [[nitrogen]] for the corn.

:Squash would then be planted in the spaces between the patches of corn in the field. They would be provided slight shelter from the sun by the corn, and would deter many animals from attacking the corn and beans, because their coarse, hairy vines and broad, stiff leaves are difficult or uncomfortable for animals like deer and raccoons to walk through, crows to land on, et cetera.

Dry beans come from both Old World varieties of broad beans (fava beans) and New World varieties (kidney, black, cranberry, pinto, navy/haricot).

==Toxins==
Some kinds of raw beans and especially red and [[kidney beans]], contain a harmful toxin (the [[lectin]] [[phytohaemagglutinin]]) that must be destroyed by cooking. A recommended method is to boil the beans for at least ten minutes; undercooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2009-07-11 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm |title=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook:  Phytohaemagglutinin  |work= [[Bad Bug Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cooking beans in a [[slow cooker]], because of the lower temperatures often used, may not destroy toxins even though the beans do not smell or taste 'bad'&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; (though this should not be a problem if the food reaches boiling and stays there for some time).

[[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] is used in some parts of Africa to improve the nutritional value of beans by removing toxins. Inexpensive fermentation improves the nutritional impact of flour from dry beans and improves digestibility, according to research co-authored by Emire Shimelis, from the Food Engineering Program at Addis Ababa University. Beans are a major source of dietary protein in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;Summary: [http://www.scidev.net/fr/climate-change-and-energy/tsunami/news/actualit-s-d-afrique-sub-saharienne-en-bref-du-25-.html Fermentation 'improves nutritional value of beans'] (Sub Saharan Africa page, Science and Development Network website).

==Nutrition==
[[Beans]] have significant amounts of fiber and [[soluble fiber]], with one cup of cooked beans providing between nine to 13&amp;nbsp;grams of fiber.&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes/NU00410 Mixed Bean Salad] (information and recipe) from [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes The Mayo Clinic Healthy Recipes]. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Soluble fiber can help lower blood [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt; Beans are also high in [[protein]], [[complex carbohydrates]], [[folate]], and [[iron]].&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

==Flatulence==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}

Many edible beans, including broad beans and soybeans, contain [[oligosaccharides]] (particularly [[raffinose]] and [[stachyose]]), a type of sugar molecule also found in [[cabbage]]. An anti-oligosaccharide [[enzyme]] is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by [[bacteria]] in the large intestine. This digestion process produces [[flatulence]]-causing gases as a byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Harold McGee | title = Food and Cooking | page = 486 | quote = Many legumes, especially soy, navy and lima beans, cause a sudden increase in bacterial activity and gas production a few hours after they're consumed. This is because they contain large amounts of carbohydrates that human digestive enzymes can't convert into absorbable sugars. These carbohydrates therefore leave the upper intestine unchanged and enter the lower reaches, where our resident bacterial population does the job we are unable to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Peter Barham | title = The Science of Cooking | page = 14 | quote = we do not possess any enzymes that are capable of breaking down larger sugars, such as raffinose etc. These 3, 4 and 5 ring sugars are made by plants especially as part of the energy storage system in seeds and beans. If we ingest these sugars we can't break them down in the intestines, rather they travel down into the colon where various bacteria digest them - and in the process produce copious amounts of carbon dioxide gas}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of bean digestion is the basis for the children's rhyme &quot;[[Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit]]&quot;.

Some species of [[mold]] produce alpha-galactosidase, an anti-oligosaccharide enzyme, which humans can take to facilitate digestion of oligosaccharides in the small intestine. This enzyme, currently sold in the United States under the brand-name [[Beano (dietary supplement)|Beano]], can be added to food or consumed separately. In many cuisines beans are cooked along with natural [[carminative]]s such as [[anise]] seeds, [[coriander]] seeds and [[cumin]].

Other strategies include soaking beans in water for several hours before mixing them with other ingredients to remove the offending sugars. Sometimes [[vinegar]] is added, but only after the beans are cooked as vinegar interferes with the beans' softening.

Fermented beans will usually not produce most of the intestinal problems that unfermented beans will, since yeast can consume the offending sugars.

==Production==
The world leader in production of dry bean is Brazil, followed by India and then China. In Europe, the most important producer is Germany.

The '''breast''' is the upper [[ventral]] region of the [[torso]] of a [[primate]], in left and right sides, which in a [[female]] contains the [[mammary gland]] that secretes [[milk]] used to feed [[infant]]s. Both [[men]] and [[women]] develop breasts from the same [[embryology|embryological]] tissues. However, at [[puberty]], female [[sex hormone]]s, mainly [[estrogen]], promote breast development which does not occur in men due to the higher level of [[testosterone]]. As a result, women's breasts become far more prominent than those of men.

== Etymology ==
Breast comes from Old English '''Brēost''' meaning &quot;breast, bosom; mind, thought, disposition,&quot; from [[Proto-Germanic]] '''Breustam''' &quot;Breast&quot; (Formed through etymological reconstruction), from the Proto-Indo-European base '''Bhreus-''' meaning &quot;To swell, sprout&quot; (Reconstructed through etymological reconstruction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/PokornyMaster-X.html Indo-European Lexicon: Pokorny Master PIE Etyma]. Utexas.edu. Retrieved on 2011-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling conforms to the Scottish and northern English dialectal pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=breast Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Breast.svg|thumb|Breast schematic diagram &lt;br&gt;(adult human female cross section) &lt;br&gt;Legend: &lt;br&gt;1. [[Chest wall]] &lt;br&gt;2. [[Pectoralis muscle]]s &lt;br&gt;3. [[Lobules]] &lt;br&gt;4. [[Nipple]] &lt;br&gt;5. [[Areola]] &lt;br&gt;6. [[Lactiferous duct|Duct]] &lt;br&gt;7. [[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] &lt;br&gt;8. [[Human skin|Skin]]]]

Anatomically, breasts are modified [[sweat gland|sudoriferous (sweat) glands]] which produce [[milk]] in [[women]], and in some rare cases, in men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tortora, Gerard J.&quot;&gt;''Introduction to the Human Body, fifth ed.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.: New York, 2001. '''560'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Each breast has one [[nipple]] surrounded by the [[areola]]. The color of the areola varies from pink to dark brown and has several [[sebaceous gland]]s. In women, the larger [[mammary gland]]s within the breast produce the milk. They are distributed throughout the breast, with two-thirds of the tissue found within 30&amp;nbsp;mm of the base of the nipple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsay&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ramsay DT, Kent JC, Hartmann RA, Hartmann PE |title=Anatomy of the lactating human breast redefined with ultrasound imaging |journal=J. Anat. |volume=206 |issue=6 |pages=525–34 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15960763 |pmc=1571528 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00417.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are drained to the nipple by between 4 and 18 ''lactiferous ducts'', where each duct has its own opening. The network formed by these ducts is complex, like the tangled roots of a tree. It is not always arranged radially, and branches close to the nipple. The ducts near the nipple do not act as milk reservoirs; Ramsay '' et al.'' have shown that conventionally described ''lactiferous sinuses'' do not, in fact, exist. Instead, most milk is actually in the back of the breast, and when suckling occurs, the smooth muscles of the gland push more milk forward.

The remainder of the breast is composed of [[connective tissue]] ([[collagen]] and [[elastin]]), [[adipose tissue]] (fat), and [[Cooper's ligaments]]. The ratio of glands to adipose tissues rises from 1:1 in nonlactating women to 2:1 in lactating women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsay&quot;/&gt;

The breasts sit over the [[pectoralis major]] muscle and usually extend from the level of the 2nd rib to the level of the 6th rib anteriorly. The superior lateral quadrant of the breast extends diagonally upwards towards the [[axillae]] and is known as the [[tail of Spence]]. A thin layer of [[mammary tissue]] extends from the [[clavicle]] above to the seventh or eighth ribs below and from the midline to the edge of the [[latissimus dorsi]] posteriorly. (For further explanation, see [[anatomical terms of location]].)

The [[artery|arterial]] [[Circulatory system|blood supply]] to the breasts is derived from the [[internal thoracic artery]] (formerly called the ''internal mammary artery''), [[lateral thoracic artery]], [[thoracoacromial artery]], and posterior intercostal arteries. The [[vein|venous]] drainage of the breast is mainly to the [[axillary vein]], but there is some drainage to the [[internal thoracic vein]] and the intercostal veins. Both sexes have a large concentration of [[blood vessel]]s and nerves in their nipples. The nipples of both women and men can become erect in response to sexual stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/Handouts/female_function_dysfunction.html McKinley Health Center – Female Sexual Function/Dysfunction – University of Illinois]. Mckinley.uiuc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; to touch, and to cold.

The breast is [[Peripheral nervous system|innervated]] by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth through sixth intercostal [[nerve]]s. The nipple is supplied by the T4 [[dermatomic area|dermatome]].

=== Lymphatic drainage ===
About 75% of [[lymph]] from the breast travels to the [[Wiktionary:ipsilateral|ipsilateral]] axillary [[lymph node]]s. The rest travels to parasternal nodes, to the other breast, or abdominal lymph nodes. The axillary nodes include the pectoral, subscapular, and humeral groups of lymph nodes. These drain to the central [[axillary lymph nodes]], then to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is particularly relevant to [[oncology]], since [[breast cancer]] is a common cancer and [[cancer]] cells can break away from a [[tumour]] and spread to other parts of the body through the lymph system by [[metastasis]].

=== Shape and support ===
[[File:Weibliche brust en.jpg|thumb|left|Relatively round breasts which protrude almost horizontally.]]


There is considerable variation in a the volume, shape, size and spacing of a woman's breasts.&lt;ref name=jelovsek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdxcyber.com/nbreast3.htm |title=Breast Asymmetry—When Does it Need Treatment? |first=Frederick R. |last=Jelovsek |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They vary in size, density, shape, [[Ptosis (breasts)|sag]] and position on a woman's chest, and their external appearance is not predictive of their internal anatomy or potential for [[lactation|nursing]]. The three major determinants of breast appearance are size, shape of the individual breast and the position of the breast and nipple when standing in an upright position.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;  Normal life events that produce hormonal changes can alter the size and shape of a woman's breasts. These include the [[menstrual cycle]]&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wood K, Cameron M, Fitzgerald K |title=Breast Size, Bra Fit and Thoracic Pain in Young Women: A Correlational Study |journal=Chiropractic &amp; Osteopathy |volume=16 |issue= |page=1 |year=2008 |pmid=18339205 |pmc=2275741|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[menopause]], or medical conditions including [[virginal breast hypertrophy]]. Women can experience unusual or unexpectedly rapid growth in breast size during to [[pregnancy]] or after birth.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;
The natural shape of a woman's breasts is primarily dependent on the support provided by the [[Cooper's ligaments]] and the underlying chest on which they rest (the base). Cooper's ligaments, also known as the suspensory ligaments of Cooper, suspend the breasts from the clavicle and the clavi-pectoral fascia. As their fibers run around and through the breast, these ligaments support the breasts in its position on the chest wall and maintain their normal shape. The breast is also attached at its base to the chest wall by the deep fascia over the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoral muscles]]. In a small number of women, the frontal ducts ([[ampullae]]) in the breasts are not flush with the surrounding breast tissue, which causes the sinus area to visibly bulge outward.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Some breasts are high and rounded, and protrude almost horizontally from the chest wall. Such &quot;high&quot; breasts are common for girls and women in early stages of development. The protruding or high breasts are anchored to the chest at the base, and the weight is distributed evenly over the area of the base of the approximately dome- or cone-shaped breasts. In the &quot;low&quot; breast, a proportion of the breasts' weight is actually supported by the chest against which the lower breast surface comes to rest, as well as the deep anchorage at the base. The weight is thus distributed over a larger area, which has the effect of reducing the strain. In both males and females, the [[thoracic cavity]] slopes progressively outwards from the thoracic inlet (at the top of the [[Human breastbone|breastbone]]) above to the lowest ribs which mark its lower boundary, allowing it to support the breasts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The [[inframammary fold]] (or line, or crease) is an anatomic structure created by adherence between elements in the skin and underlying connective tissue&lt;ref name=&quot;Boutros_S&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boutros S, Kattash M, Wienfeld A, Yuksel E, Baer S, Shenaq S |title=The intradermal anatomy of the inframammary fold |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1030–3 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9734420 |doi= 10.1097/00006534-199809040-00017|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=102&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents the inferior extent of breast anatomy. Some teenagers may develop breasts whose skin comes into contact with the chest below the fold at an early age, and some women may never develop such breasts; both situations are perfectly normal.

=== Sagging===

The relationship of the nipple position to the [[inframammary fold]] is described as [[ptosis (breasts)|ptosis]], a term also applied to other body parts. It generally refers to drooping or sagging. Due to the natural weight of breasts, relaxation of support structures,{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}, and most of all aging, the nipple-areola complex and breast tissue may eventually hang below the fold, and in some cases depending on their size the breasts may extend as far as, or even beyond, the navel. The length from the nipple to the sternal notch (central, upper border) in the youthful breast averages 21&amp;nbsp;cm and is a common [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] figure used to assess both breast symmetry and ptosis. Lengthening of both this measurement and the distance between the nipple and the fold are both characteristic of advancing grades of ptosis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The end of the breast, which includes the nipple, may either be flat (a 180° angle) or angled (angles lower than 180°). Breast ends are rarely angled sharper than 60°. Angling of the end of the breast is caused in part by the ligaments that suspend it, such that the breast ends often have a more obtuse angle when a woman is lying on her back. Breasts exist in a range of ratios between length and base diameter, usually ranging from ½ to 1.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== Asymmetry ===


Up to 90 per cent of women's breasts are asymmetrical in size or position to some degree.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;&lt;ref name=jelovsek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdxcyber.com/nbreast3.htm |title=Breast Asymmetry—When Does it Need Treatment? |first=Frederick R. |last=Jelovsek |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gayne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menstrual-cycle.info/137-Breast-asymmetry.html |title=Breast Asymmetry | first=Gayane |last= Dolyan M.D. |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 25% of women's breasts display a persistent, visible breast asymmetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgh.harvard.edu/children/adolescenthealth/articles/aa_breast_development.aspx |title=Breast Development |publisher= Massachusetts Hospital for Children| accessdate=2010-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as differing in size by at least one cup size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4embarrassingillnesses.com/conditions/asymmetric-breasts/ |title=Asymmetric Breasts |accessdate=6-2-2010 |publisher=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embarrassingissues.co.uk/AsymmetricBreasts.html |title=Asymmetric Breasts |accessdate=6-2-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about 5%&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt; to 10%&lt;ref name=losken/&gt; women, their breasts are severely different, with the left breast being larger in 62% of cases.&lt;ref name=losken&gt;{{cite journal |author=Losken A, Fishman I, Denson DD, Moyer HR, Carlson GW |title=An objective evaluation of breast symmetry and shape differences using 3-dimensional images |journal=Annals  of Plastic Surgery |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=571–5 |year=2005 |month=December|pmid=16327452 |doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000185459.49434.5f}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these women, the asymmetry is sufficiently different that a surgeon would consider corrective surgery. Most surgeons will only perform an augmentation procedure to treat asymmetry if the woman's breasts differ by at least one cup size.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt; The asymmetry may be reflected in the size of the breast, the positioning of the nipple on the breast, the angle of the breast, and the position or relative height of the [[inframammary fold]] where the breast begins on the woman's chest.

Why some women's breasts are asymmetrical is not well understood, although genetics are believed to be partly responsible. During puberty, the hormone [[estrogen|oestrogen]] triggers the breast tissue growth, usually beginning about two years after the girl's first [[menstrual  cycle|menstrual period]]. Breast tissue continually grows for up to four years, during which there are naturally occurring size differences. Most women gain their final breast shape and size at about age 21.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;

=== Development ===
[[File:Gynecomastia 001.jpg|thumb|left|Male with severe [[gynecomastia]]]]
In both men and women, there is [[prenatal development]] where the basic structure of the breasts is formed.

Girls substantially develop breasts during [[puberty]], as a result of changing [[sex hormone]]s, chiefly [[estrogen]], which also has been demonstrated to cause the development of woman-like, enlarged breasts in men, a condition called [[gynecomastia]]. The onset of this secondary (postnatal) breast development is called [[thelarche]]. In all other animals, breast development happens during the female's first pregnancy, rather than during puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, the breasts may be significantly different in size, or one breast may fail to develop entirely.

A large number of medical conditions are known to cause abnormal development of the breasts during puberty. [[Virginal breast hypertrophy]] is a condition which involves excessive growth of the breasts, and in some cases the continued growth beyond the usual pubescent age. Breast [[hypoplasia]] is a condition where one or both breasts fail to develop.

=== Changes ===
[[File:Schwangerschaftsstreifen.JPG|thumb|right|Breast with visible stretchmarks.]]

As breasts are mostly composed of adipose tissue, their size can change over time. This occurs for a number of reasons, most obviously when a girl grows during [[puberty]] and when a woman becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. The breast size may also change if she gains (or loses) [[human weight|weight]] for any other reason. Any rapid increase in size of the breasts can result in the appearance of [[stretchmarks]].

It is typical for a number of other changes to occur during pregnancy: in addition to becoming larger, the breasts generally become firmer, mainly due to [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] of the mammary gland in response to the [[hormone]] [[prolactin]]. The size of the nipples may increase noticeably and their pigmentation may become darker. These changes may continue during [[breastfeeding]]. The breasts generally revert to approximately their previous size after pregnancy, although there may be some increased sagging and stretchmarks.

The size of a woman's breasts may fluctuate during the [[menstrual cycle]], particularly with [[premenstrual water retention]]. An increase in breast size is a common [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] of use of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]].

Breasts sag if the [[Cooper's ligaments|ligaments]] become elongated, a natural process that can occur over time and is also influenced by the breast bouncing while exercising (see [[Sports bra]]). Breasts can decrease in size at menopause if [[estrogen]] levels decline.

== Function ==
=== Breastfeeding ===
[[File:breastfeeding infant.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An infant breastfeeding]]
{{Main|Breastfeeding}}
The primary function of [[mammary gland]]s is to nurture young by producing [[breast milk]]. The production of milk is called [[lactation]]. (While the mammary glands that produce milk are present in the male, they normally remain undeveloped.) The orb-like shape of breasts may help limit heat loss, as a fairly high temperature is required for the production of milk. Alternatively, one theory states that the shape of the human breast evolved in order to prevent infants from suffocating while feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bentley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Gillian R.|year=2001|title=The Evolution of the Human Breast|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=32|issue=38|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1033|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since human infants have a small jaw (not protruding, like other primates), the infant's nose might be blocked if the mother's chest was too flat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt; According to this theory, as the human jaw receded, the breasts became larger to compensate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;

Milk production unrelated to pregnancy can also occur. This condition, called [[galactorrhea]], may be an [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]] of some medicinal drugs (such as some antipsychotic medications), extreme physical stress or endocrine disorders. If it occurs in men it is called [[male lactation]], and is often classified as a pathological symptom due to its strong correlation to pituitary disorders. Newborn babies are often capable of lactation because they receive the hormones [[prolactin]] and [[oxytocin]] via the mother's bloodstream, filtered through the [[placenta]]. This neonatal liquid is known colloquially as [[witch's milk]].

=== Other suggested functions ===
[[Zoologists]] point out that no female mammal other than the human has breasts of comparable size, relative to the rest of the body, when not lactating and that humans are the only [[primate]] that has permanently protuberant breasts.

Some zoologists (notably [[Desmond Morris]]) believe that the shape of female breasts evolved as a frontal counterpart to that of the [[buttocks]], the reason being that while other primates mate in the [[doggy-style|rear-entry]] position, humans, because of their upright posture, are more likely to successfully [[copulate]] by mating face to face, the so-called [[missionary position]]. Morris suggested in 1967 that a secondary sexual characteristic on a woman's chest would have encouraged this in more primitive incarnations of the human race, and a face-on encounter may have helped found a relationship between partners beyond merely a sexual one.&lt;ref name=&quot;NakedApe&quot;&gt;Morris (1967), pp. 64–68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory has since been generally disregarded due to the discovery that other primates, such as [[orangutan]]s, routinely mate in the face-to-face position even though the females do not have prominent breasts.

The female [[gelada]] monkey in [[estrus]] presents swollen breasts to signal her reproductive status to the males.

== History ==
[[File:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|right|A &quot;[[Snake Goddess]]&quot; statuette of ancient [[Minoan Civilization]], c. 1600&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
In European pre-historic societies, sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common. A typical example is the so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]], one of many [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000&amp;nbsp;BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] were represented as pillars studded with breasts. [[Isis]], an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling [[pharaohs]], thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god [[Hapy]] who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the [[Nile]]. Female breasts were also prominent in the [[Minoan civilization]] in the form of the famous [[Snake Goddess]] statuettes. In [[Ancient Greece]] there were several cults worshipping the &quot;Kourotrophos&quot;, the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]]. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Yalom (1998) pp. 9–16; see Eva Keuls (1993), ''Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens'' for a detailed study of male-dominant rule in ancient Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like [[Athena]], the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern [[pin up]]s by historian Marilyn Yalom.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom (1998), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred &quot;usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander (1993), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular legend at the time was of the [[Amazons]], a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.

===The breast as an anthropomorphic geographic feature===
{{Main|Breast shaped hill}}

[[File:Looking up the north west slopes to the summit of Maiden Pap. - geograph.org.uk - 388491.jpg|thumb|Looking up the north west slopes to the summit of one of the [[Maiden Paps]], [[Caithness]], [[Scotland]].]]
There are mountains or mountain formations in the world named after the human female breast. Mostly they are so named because of their shape and for being connected with local ancestral veneration of the breast as a [[symbol of fertility]] and well-being. In Asia there was a mountain, known as &quot;Breast Mountain&quot; with a cave in which [[Buddhist monk]] [[Bodhidharma]] (Da Mo) spent a long time in [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usashaolintemple.org/chanbuddhism-history/ The Story of Bodhidharma]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other mountains where the central theme of the name is the human female breast are: [[Mount Elgon]] on the [[Uganda]]-[[Kenya]] border, [[Lochnagar|Beinn Chìochan]] in [[Scotland]], the &quot;Bundok ng Susong Dalaga&quot; (Maiden's breast mountains) in [[Talim Island]], Philippines, the twin hills known as the [[Paps of Anu]] (''Dá Chích Anann'' or the breasts of [[Anann|Anu]]), near [[Killarney]] in [[Ireland]], the 2,086 m high ''Tetica de Bacares'' or &quot;La Tetica&quot; in the [[Sierra de Los Filabres]], [[Spain]], and [[Khao Nom Sao]] in [[Thailand]], [[Cerro Las Tetas]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Aphrodite|Breasts of Aphrodite]] in Mykonos, among many others.

== Cultural aspects ==
=== Symbolism ===
In [[Saint symbology|Christian iconography]], some works of art depict women with their breasts in their hands or on a platter, signifying that they died as a martyr by having their breasts severed; one example of this is [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha of Sicily]]. In [[Silappatikaram]], [[Kannagi]] tears off her left breast and flings it on [[Madurai]], cursing it, causing a devastating fire.

=== Sexual aspects ===
{{See also|Mammary intercourse|Breast fetishism}}

In some cultures breasts play a role in [[human sexual activity]]. Breasts and especially the nipple are one of a woman's [[erogenous zones]]. They are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings; and it is common to press or massage them with hands or [[Oral stimulation of nipples|orally]] before or during sexual activity. Some women can achieve [[breast orgasm]]s. In the [[History of India|ancient Indian]] work the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', light scratching of the breasts with nails and biting with teeth are considered erotic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/index.htm Sir Richard Burton's English translation of Kama Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt; On [[sexual arousal]] breast size increases, [[vein|venous]] patterns across the breasts become more visible, and nipples harden.  Compared to other primates, human breasts are proportionately large throughout adult females' lives. Some writers have suggested that they may have evolved as a visual signal of sexual maturity and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many people regard the female human body, of which breasts are an important aspect, to be [[aesthetic]]ally pleasing, as well as [[erotic]]. Research conducted at the [[Victoria University of Wellington]] showed that breasts are often the first thing men look at, and for a longer time than other body parts.&lt;ref name=dailytelegraph&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/scientific-proof-that-men-look-at-womens-breasts-first-and-their-face-is-almost-last/story-e6frf00i-1225770286482 Scientific proof that men look at women's breasts first and their face is almost last ] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The writers of the study had initially speculated that the reason for this is due to [[endocrinology]] with larger breasts indicating higher levels of [[estrogen]] and a sign of greater fertility,&lt;ref name=dailytelegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3682657.stm Hourglass figure fertility link – ''BBC  News'']&lt;/ref&gt; but the researchers said that &quot;Men may be looking more often at the breasts because they are simply aesthetically pleasing, regardless of the size.&quot;&lt;ref name=dailytelegraph /&gt;

Many people regard bare female breasts to be [[erotic]], and they can elicit heightened [[sexual desire]]s in some men in some cultures. Some people show a [[sexual interest]] in female [[breasts]] distinct from that of the person, which may be regarded as a [[breast fetish]].&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2003). Encyclopaedia of Murder and Violent Crime. Sage Publications Inc. ISBN 076192437X&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clothing ===
[[File:Namibie Himba 0716a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Himba]] woman wearing traditional clothing in northern [[Namibia]], where the social norm is for women to be bare-breasted.]]
{{See also|Toplessness|Cleavage (breasts)|Modesty|Nudism|Exhibitionism}}

Since the breasts are flexible, their shape may be affected by clothing, and [[foundation garment]]s in particular. A [[brassiere]] (bra) may be worn to give additional support and to alter the shape of the breasts. There is some debate over whether such support is desirable. A long term clinical study showed that women with large breasts can suffer [[myalgia]], or shoulder pain as a result of bra straps,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ryan EL |title=Pectoral girdle myalgia in women: a 5-year study in a clinical setting |journal=Clin J Pain |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=298–303 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11153784 |doi= 10.1097/00002508-200012000-00004|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0749-8047&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a well fitting bra should support most of the breasts' weight with proper sized cups and back band rather than on the shoulders.

The [[social norm]] of most cultures is for breasts to be covered in public, though the extent of expected coverage varies with context. Some religions afford the breast a special status, either in formal teachings or in symbolism. [[Islam]] forbids public exposure of the female breasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cover_Chest&quot;&gt;“They shall cover their chests” or “they should draw their khimar (veils) over their bosoms”, depending on the translation, [[Quran]] (24:31). [http://www.submission.org/suras/sura24.html Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures associate breasts primarily with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in terms of [[modesty]] and [[decency]]. Other cultures view female [[toplessness]] as acceptable, and in some countries the [[social norm]] is for women to be bare breasted, such as the [[Himba]] in northern [[Namibia]]. In some African cultures, for example, the thigh is regarded as highly sexualised and never exposed in public, but breast exposure is not [[taboo]]. Opinion on the exposure of breasts often depends on the place and context, and in some [[Western world|Western societies]] exposure of breasts on a beach may be acceptable, but not, for example, in town centres. In some areas the prohibition against the display of a woman's breasts only applies to the exposure of [[nipple]]s.

Some women in some areas and cultures object to breasts being regarded as sexual objects and approach the issue of exposure of breast in public as one of [[sexual equality]]. In the United States, the [[topfreedom|topfree equality movement]] seeks to redress this imbalance. This movement won a decision in 1992 in the [[New York (state)|New York]] State Court of Appeals—''People v Santorelli'', where the court ruled that the state's indecent exposure laws do not ban women from being bare breasted. A similar movement succeeded in most parts of Canada in the 1990s. In Australia and much of [[Europe]] it is acceptable for women and teenage girls to sunbathe topless on some public beaches and swimming pools, but these are generally the only public areas where exposing breasts is acceptable.

When [[History of breastfeeding#Breastfeeding in public|breastfeeding a baby in public]], legal and social rules regarding [[indecent exposure]] and [[dress code]]s, as well as inhibitions of the woman, tend to be relaxed. Numerous laws around the world have made public breastfeeding legal and disallow companies from prohibiting it in the workplace. Yet the public reaction at the sight of breastfeeding can make the situation uncomfortable for those involved.

[[File:Dr. Placik Breast Reduction.jpg|thumb|right|Bilateral breast reduction]]
Many women regard breasts as an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html secondary sex characteristics]&lt;/ref&gt; and a factor in the [[sexual attractiveness]] of a woman. Many women identify their [[femininity]] and [[Self-concept|sense of self]] with their breasts. When a woman considers her breasts deficient in some respect, she may have surgical procedures performed on them to, for example, enhance [[symmetry]] or to increase or reduce their size. Some women have [[plastic surgery]] on their breast for [[cosmetic surgery|cosmetic]] or [[reconstructive surgery|reconstructive reasons]].

After [[mastectomy]] (the surgical removal of a breast, usually to treat [[breast cancer]]) some women undergo [[breast reconstruction]], either with [[breast implants]] or autologous tissue transfer, using fat and tissues from the abdomen ([[TRAM flap]]) or back (latissiumus muscle flap).

[[Breast reduction]] surgery is a common procedure which involves removing excess breast tissue, fat, and skin with repositioning of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). Cosmetic procedures include breast lifts ([[mastopexy]]), [[breast augmentation]] with implants, and procedures that combine both elements. Implants containing either [[silicone]] gel or [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] are available for augmentation and reconstructive surgeries. Surgery can repair [[inverted nipple]]s by releasing ductal tissues which are tethering. Breast lift with or without reduction can be part of upper body lift after massive weight loss body contouring.

Any surgery of the breast carries with it the potential for interfering with future breastfeeding,&lt;ref name=&quot;Neifert&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Neifert | first=M | authorlink = | coauthors=DeMarzo S, Seacat J, Young D, Leff M, Orleans M | title=The influence of breast surgery, breast appearance and pregnancy-induced changes on lactation sufficiency as measured by infant weight gain | journal=Birth | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=31–38 | year=1990 | pmid=2288566 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1990.tb00007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LLLsurgery&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=FAQ on Previous Breast Surgery and Breastfeeding | publisher=La Leche League International | date=2006-08-29 | url=http://www.lalecheleague.org/FAQ/surgery.html | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DianaWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=West | first=Diana | title=Breastfeeding After Breast Surgery | publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association | url =http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/surgery.html | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing alterations in nipple sensation, and difficulty in interpreting [[mammography]] (xrays of the breast).

== Health ==
=== Breast health factors ===

Factors that appear to be implicated in decreasing the risk of, or early diagnosis of breast cancer are regular breast examinations by health care professionals, regular [[mammograms]], [[Breast self examination|self examination of breasts]], healthy diet, and exercise to decrease excess body fat.  Healthy diet appears to reduce the risk of breast cancer, and includes limiting dietary fat, eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of nutrients, and dietary fibre such as are found in fruits and vegetables, and restricting intake of alcohol to a maximum of two drinks per day or less.&lt;ref&gt;Mctiernan, Anne, M.D., Ph.D., Gralow, Julie.M.D., Talbot, Lisa, MPH.

'''Baghdad''' ({{lang-ar|بغداد}}, ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|Baġdād}}'', {{IPA-ar|bæɣˈdæːd|IPA}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Iraq]], as well as the coterminous [[Baghdad Governorate]]. The population of Baghdad in 2011 is approximately 5,216,040, it is the largest city in Iraq,&lt;ref name=population&gt;Estimates of total population differ substantially. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] gives a 2001 population of 4,950,000, the [[Lancet surveys of casualties of the Iraq War|2006 Lancet Report]] states a population of 6,554,126 in 2004.

Located along the [[Tigris|Tigris River]], the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the [[Islamic World]]. This in addition to housing several key academic institutions (e.g. [[House of Wisdom]]) garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the &quot;Center of Learning&quot;. Throughout the [[High Middle Ages]], Baghdad was considered to be the largest city in the world with an estimated population of 1,200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_throughout_history#cite_note-27 |title= List of largest cities throughout history |publisher=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was largely [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed]] at the hands of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]) in 1938, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of [[Arabic culture]].

In contemporary times the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage, most recently due to the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led invasion of Iraq]] in 2003 and the subsequent [[War in Iraq|state of war]] that lasted until 2010. The city is a frequent subject to [[Insurgency in Iraq|insurgency activities]] and [[Terrorism in Iraq|terrorist attacks]].

== Toponym ==
There have been several rival proposals as to the specific etymology of the name Baghdad. The most reliable and most widely accepted among these is that the name is a [[Middle Persian]] &lt;ref&gt;http://admin.iraqupdates.net/p_articles.php/article/35631&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackanthem.com/News/Fact_Sheets/Baghdad_Iraq10693.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://persiangulfstudies.com/en/index.asp?P=NEWS2&amp;Nu=45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://islam.about.com/cs/history/a/aa040703a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranica.com/articles/baghdad-iranian-connection-1-pr-Mongol&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=rezD7rvuf9YC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;dq=%22Baghdad+name+middle+persian%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eJ22Td_1OZSL4gaA_LTQDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=i-4WhilzYkQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Baghdad+godgiven%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ep62TfPrM4i74QaMwsncDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; compound of Bag &quot;god&quot; + dād &quot;given&quot;, translating to &quot;God-given&quot; or &quot;God's gift&quot;, whence [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] Baɣdād.  This in turn can be traced to Old Persian.
.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strange pg 10&quot;&gt;Guy Le Strange, &quot;Baghdad During the Abbasid Caliphate from Contemporary Arabic and Persian&quot;, pg 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A less probable guess has been [[Persian language|Persian]] compound '''Bağ''' &quot;garden&quot; + '''dād''' &quot;fair&quot;, translating to &quot;The fair Garden&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |title=ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟ |publisher=Seenjeem.maktoob.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |title=ما معنى (بغداد)؟ - تمت الإجابة عنه - Google إجابات |publisher=Egabat.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another leading proposal is that the name comes from Middle Persian Bāgh-dād &quot;The Given Garden&quot;. The name is pre-Islamic and the origins are unclear, but it is related to previous settlements, which did not have any political or commercial power, making it a virtually new foundation in the time of the [[Abbasids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |title=ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟ |publisher=Seenjeem.maktoob.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Egabat.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |title=ما معنى (بغداد)؟ - تمت الإجابة عنه - Google إجابات |publisher=Egabat.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of Baghdad importance increased rapidly by the time it was founded by the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Mansur]], who chose the name Madinat al-Salaam or &quot;City of Peace&quot; for his new foundation.  This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name. By the 11th century, &quot;Baghdad&quot; had become almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Baghdad}}

=== Origins ===
In 762, Baghdad was established as a city by [[Al-Mansur|Abu Ja'far Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mansur]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Ghareeb, Beth Dougherty. ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq''. Scarecrow Press, 2004. p. 154. ISBN 9780810843301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foundation ====
On 30 July 762 the [[caliph]] [[Al Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city and it was built under the supervision of the [[Barmakids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Times History of the World |publisher=Times Books |location=London |year=2000 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the [[Abbasids]]. Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying, &quot;This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wiet |first=Gastron |title=Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate |location= |publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Press |year=1971 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's growth was helped by its location, which gave it control over strategic and trading routes, along the Tigris. A reason why Baghdad provided an excellent location was the abundance of water and the dry climate. Water exists on both north and south ends of the city gates, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time.

[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|upright|Zumurrud Khaton tomb in Baghdad (built in 1202 AD), photo of 1932.]]
Baghdad eclipsed [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the [[Sassanid empire|Persian Empire]], which was located some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [[Salman Pak]], just to the south of Greater Baghdad. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [[Seleucia]], the first capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Seleucia]] had  earlier replaced the city of [[Babylon]].

In its early years the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the [[Qur'an]], when it refers to [[Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Four years before Baghdad's foundation, in 758, Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city. July was chosen as the starting time because two astronomers, [[Naubakht Ahvaz]] and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion, [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.

The bricks used to make the city were {{convert|18|in|mm}} on all four sides. [[Abu Hanifa]] was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for the use of both human consumption and the manufacturing of the bricks. Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city, and marble steps led down to the river's edge.

The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about 19&amp;nbsp;km (12 miles) in diameter. The city was designed as a circle about 2&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, leading it to be known as the &quot;Round City&quot;. The original design shows as single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the center of the city lay the [[mosque]], as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional [[Persia]]n [[Sasanian]] [[urban planning|urban design]]. The Sasanian city of [[Firouzabad|Gur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], built 500 years before Baghdad,  is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.

==== The surrounding walls ====

The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], Khurasan, and [[Damascus]]; named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations.&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The distance between these gates was a little less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44&amp;nbsp;m thick at the base and about 12&amp;nbsp;m  thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30&amp;nbsp;m  high, which included [[merlon]]s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [[embrasures]]. This wall was surrounded by another  wall with a thickness of 50&amp;nbsp;m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by solid [[glacis]], whichut of bricks and [[quicklime]]. Beyond the outer wall was a water filled moat.&lt;ref&gt;Weit, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Golden Gate Palace ====
[[Image:AbassidQasr Baghdad Iraq.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Example alt text |Qasr-Al-Khalifa or Abbasid Palace in [[Samarra]] was built in 221 [[Hijri year|AH]] (AD 836) and is one of the most famous Islamic palaces in the world.]]
In the middle of Baghdad, in the central square was the Golden Gate Palace. The Palace was the residence of the caliph and his family. In the central part of the building was a green dome that was 39&amp;nbsp;m high. Surrounding the palace was an [[esplanade]], a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph [[Al-Mansur]] the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.&lt;ref&gt;Wiet, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The roundness points to the fact that it was based on [[Abbassi architecture|Arab]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Cite book|title=Islam Art and Architecture|first=Markus|last=Hattstein|coauthors=Peter Delius|year=2000|page=96|isbn=3-8290-2558-0|publisher=Könemann|location=Cologne}}
* ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', [[Columbia University]], p.413.&lt;/ref&gt; The two designers who were hired by [[al-Mansur]] to plan the city's design were [[Naubakht]], a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], a Jew from [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Science and Engineering|first=Donald R.|last=Hill|year=1994|page=10|isbn=0-7486-0457-X|publisher=Edinburgh Univ. Press|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Abbasids and the round city ====
[[File:Baghdad 150 to 300 AH.gif|300px|thumb|The city of Baghdad between 767 and 912 AD]]
The Abbasid Caliphate was based on their being the descendants of the uncle of [[Muhammad]] and being part of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They used [[Shi'a]] resentment, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]ian movement, and appeals to the ambitions and traditions of the newly conquered [[Persian people|Persian]] aristocracy to overthrow the [[Umayyads]].&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
The Abbasids sought to combine the hegemony of the [[Arabic]] tribes with the imperial, court, ceremonial, and administrative structures of the Persians. The Abbasids considered themselves the inheritors of two traditions: the Arabian-Islamic (bearers of the mantle of Muhammad) and the Persian (successors to the [[Sassanid]] monarchs).&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

These two things are evident from the construction, which is modeled after Persian structures and the need of Mansur to place the capital in a place that was representative of Arab-Islamic identity by building the [[House of Wisdom]], where ancient texts were translated from their original language, such as Greek, to Arabic. Mansur is credited with the &quot;[[Translation Movement]]&quot; for this.  Further, Baghdad is also near the ancient Sassanid imperial seat of [[Ctesiphon]] on the Tigris River.

=== A centre of learning (8th to 13th centuries) ===
{{See|Islamic Golden Age}}
Within a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of [[learning]] and [[commerce]]. The [[House of Wisdom]] was an establishment dedicated to the translation of [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Middle Persian]] and [[Syriac]] works. Scholars headed to Baghdad from all over the [[Abbasid]] empire, facilitating the introduction of Greek and [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indian science]] into the Arabic and Islamic world at that time. Baghdad was likely the [[Historical urban community sizes|largest city in the world]] from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it was tied by [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;Matt T. Rosenberg, [http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm ''Largest Cities Through History''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' tales are set in Baghdad during this period.

==== The end of the Abbasids in Baghdad ====
[[File:Baghdad old Abbasid Minaret.jpg|thumb|upright|Suq al-Ghazel (The Yarn Bazaar) Minaret in Baghdad, [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]). This is the oldest [[minaret]] in Baghdad. It belonged to [[the Caliph Mosque]] built by Caliph Muktafi 901–907 AD.]]
By the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2 million&lt;ref name=Modelski&gt;[[George Modelski]], ''World Cities: –3000 to 2000'', Washington, D.C.: FAROS 2000, 2003. ISBN 978-0967623016. See also [http://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/ Evolutionary World Politics Homepage].&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=International dictionary of historic places, Volume 4: Middle East and Africa|last=Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin|first=K. A. Berney, Paul E. Schellinger|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|page=116|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the [[Caliphate]], including relocations of the capital to [[Samarra]] (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the [[Iran]]ian [[Buwayhid]]s (945–1055) and [[Seljuk Turks]] (1055–1135).

The [[Seljuks]] were a clan of the [[Oghuz Turks]] from the Siberian steppes that converted to the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the [[Ghaznavids]], taking over their land and in 1055, [[Tughril Beg]], the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the [[Buyids]] dynasty of Shiites that ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as [[Sultans]] in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime) Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the [[Fatimids]] under the Turkish general [[Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri]], an adherent of the [[Ismailis]] along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. ''The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid ''[[da'i]]&lt;i&gt; [[al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi]]'' had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking [[Mawṣil]], [[Wasit, Iraq|Wāsit]] and [[Kufa]]. Soonafter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary, Farhad 1990&quot;&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1058, a Shi'i ''[[adhān]]'' (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a ''[[khutba]]'' (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary, Farhad 1990&quot;/&gt; Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1258, Baghdad was captured by the [[Mongols]] led by [[Hulegu]], a grandson of [[Chingiz Khan]] ([[Genghis Khan]]) during the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities], George Modelski&lt;/ref&gt; Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]], and destroyed large sections of the city. The [[canal]]s and [[dyke (construction)|dykes]] forming the city's [[irrigation]] system were also destroyed. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate, a blow from which the [[Islamic]] civilization never fully recovered.

At this point Baghdad was ruled by the [[Il-Khanids]], the [[Mongol]] emperors of [[Iran]]. In 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by [[Timur]] (&quot;Tamerlane&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Frazier, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/25/050425fa_fact4?currentPage=5 Annals of history: Invaders: Destroying Baghdad], [[The New Yorker]] 25 April 2005. p.5&lt;/ref&gt; When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav042806.shtml New Book Looks at Old-Style Central Asian Despotism], EurasiaNet Civil Society, Elizabeth Kiem, April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It became a provincial capital controlled by the [[Jalayirid]] (1400–1411), [[Black Sheep Turkmen|Kara Koyunlu]] (1411–1469), [[White Sheep Turkmen|Ak Koyunlu]] (1469–1508), and the Iranian [[Safavid]] (1508–1534) dynasties.

=== Ottoman era (16th to 19th centuries) ===

In 1534, Baghdad was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad fell into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Safavid Turks, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)|Between 1623 and 1638]], it returned briefly to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands.

[[Cambridge University Press]]. p.651. ISBN 0521574552&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under a [[Mamluk rule in Iraq|Mamluk]] government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by [[Ali Ridha Pasha]] in 1831. From 1851-1852 and from 1861–1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by [[Mehmed Namık Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Cetinsaya, Gokhan. ''Ottoman Administration of Iraq, 1890-1908''. London and New York: Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nuttall Encyclopedia]] reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000. Aside from ethnically Arab Iraqis, the city was also home to a substantial ancient [[Iraqi Jews|Jewish]] community, which comprised over a quarter of the city's population (this proportion would grow in later years){{fact|date=April 2011}}.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Baghdad LOC 13186.jpg|thumb|Baghdad in 1932]]

Baghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1917, when captured by the British during World War I. From 1920, Baghdad became the capital of the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and, after 1932, Baghdad was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. Iraq was given formal independence in 1932 and increased autonomy in 1946. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950 of which 140,000 (nearly a quarter) were [[Iraqi Jews|Jewish]]. In the 1920s, Baghdad was 40 percent Jewish. Jews made up the largest single community in the city and controlled up to 95 per cent of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1427687/The-terror-behind-Iraqs-Jewish-exodus.html The terror behind Iraq's Jewish exodus], ''Daily Telegraph'', 28 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad was also home to many prominent Jewish figures, such as [[Sassoon Eskell]].

On 1 April 1941 members of the &quot;Golden Square&quot; and [[Rashid Ali]] staged [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|a coup in Baghdad]]. Rashid Ali installed a pro-[[Nazi Germany|German]] and pro-[[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] government to replace the pro-British government of [[Regent]] [['Abd al-Ilah|Abdul Ilah]]. On 31 May, after the resulting [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] and after Rashid Ali and his government had fled, the Mayor of Baghdad surrendered to British and Commonwealth forces. After the collapse, a [[pogrom]] ([[Farhud]]) took place against the Jewish population of Bagdhad, where around 175 Jews had been killed, one thousand injured, and 900 Jewish homes were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gilbert]].

On 14 July 1958, members of the [[Iraqi Army]] under [[Abdul Karim Kassem]] [[14 July Revolution|staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq]]. King [[Faisal II]], former Prime Minister [[Nuri al-Said]], former Regent [[Prince]] Abdul Ilah, members of the royal family, and others were brutally killed during the coup. Many of the victim's bodies were then dragged through the streets of Baghdad.

During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the [[price of petroleum]], Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. However, the [[Iran–Iraq War]] of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted by [[Saddam Hussein]] to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad.

In 1991 and 2003, the [[Gulf War]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] caused [[Damage to Baghdad during the 2003 Iraq War|significant damage]] to Baghdad's [[transportation]], [[Electricity generation|power]], and sanitary infrastructure as the US-led coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults in the city in the two wars.

== Main sights ==
[[File:Baghdadmuseum.png|right|thumb|The [[National Museum of Iraq]] in central Baghdad]]
Points of interest include the [[National Museum of Iraq]] whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed when it was set alight by the library staff and looters before and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The Al Kadhimain Shrine in the northwest of Baghdad (in [[al-Kāżimiyyah]]) is one of the most important Shi'ite religious sites in Iraq. It was finished in 1515 and the 7th ([[Musa ibn Jafar al-Kathim]]) and the 9th [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]] ([[Muhammad al-Taqi|Mohammed Al-Jawad]]) were buried there. One of the oldest buildings is the 12th century or 13th century [[Abbasid Palace]]. The palace is part of the central historical area of the city and close to other historically important buildings such as the Saray Building and Al-Mustansiriyah School (From the Abbasid Period). [[Baghdad International Airport]] (BIAP) is Iraq's largest airport located 16&amp;nbsp;km from Baghdad's central business district. It is the home of Iraq's national airline, [[Iraqi Airways]].

=== Baghdad Zoo ===
{{Main|Baghdad Zoo}}

The [[Baghdad Zoo]] was the largest zoo in the Middle East. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food or water.&lt;!--

The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the [[River Tigris]]. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called '[[Risafa]]' and the Western half known as '[[Karkh]]'. The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of [[alluvium|alluvial]] origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river.

Baghdad has a hot [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') and is, in terms of maximum temperatures, one of the hottest cities in the world. In the summer from June to August, the average maximum temperature is as high as {{convert|44|°C|°F|abbr=on}} accompanied by blazing sunshine: rainfall is almost completely unknown at this time of year. Temperatures exceeding {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in the shade are by no means unheard of,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and even at night temperatures in summer are seldom below {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Because the [[humidity]] is very low (usually under 10%) due to Baghdad's distance from the marshy [[Persian Gulf]], [[dust storm]]s from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.

Winters boast mild to warm days and variable nights. From December to February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|15.5|to|18.5|C|F}}, though highs above {{convert|70|F|C}} are not unheard of.  Low temperatures can be chilly: the average January low is {{convert|3.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}} but lows below freezing only occur a couple of times per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Annual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November to March, averages around {{convert|120|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, but has been as high as {{convert|575|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and as low as {{convert|23|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. On January 11, 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) – Jan 11, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5huPkYk4bGVvo1Sa1tWeH-tgENiFw |title=Afp.google.com, First snow for 100 years falls on Baghdad |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative divisions ==
{{See also|Administrative districts in Baghdad|Baghdad government}}

[[File:Bagdad-sat.JPG|thumb|right|Baghdad as seen by [[Spot Satellite]]]]
The city of Baghdad has 89 official neighbourhoods within 9 districts. These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centres for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods, elected by neighbourhood caucuses.

The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings. Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them.

Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.

The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighbourhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council.

The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February, 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected.

This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome but Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighbourhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people.

The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://images.usatoday.com/news/graphics/troop_surge/flash.swf | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Reconstruction of Iraq|Iraqi reconstruction]] efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, like architect and urban designer [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]]'s [[Reconstruction of Iraq#The Proposed Baghdad Baghdad is mizz Renaissance Plan|Baghdad Renaissance Plan]] and the [[Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center]] have also been made.

There are also plans to build a giant [[Ferris wheel]] akin to the [[London Eye]]. Iraq's Tourism Board also is seeking investors to develop a &quot;romantic&quot; island on the River Tigris in Baghdad that was once a popular honeymoon spot for newlywed Iraqis. The project would include a six-star hotel, spa, an 18-hole golf course and a country club. In addition, the go-ahead has been given to build numerous architecturally unique skyscrapers along the Tigris that would develop the city's financial centre in Kadhehemiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=3:48 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26425911/ |title=Baghdad plans to build giant Ferris wheel |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project not only addresses the urgent need for new residential units in Baghdad but also acts as a real symbol of progress in the war torn city, as Baghdad has not seen projects of this scale for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baghdadgov.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178:baghdad-investment-createing-of-1824-housing-units-in-baghdad&amp;catid=25:the-project&amp;Itemid=95 |title=Baghdad Investment: Creating (1824) housing units in Baghdad. |work=Baghdad Governorate Website |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baghdad has always played an important role in [[Arab cultural]] life and has been the home of noted writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous [[Arab]] poets and singers such as [[Nizar Qabbani]], [[Umm Kulthum]],[[Fairuz]], [[Salah Al-Hamdani]], [[Ilham al-Madfai]] and others wrote beautiful poems and sang for Baghdad.  

The [[Baghdad Arabic|dialect of Arabic spoken in Baghdad today]] differs from that of other large urban centres in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Verseegh, ''The Arabic Language''). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sacks of the late [[Middle Ages]].

=== Institutions ===

Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include:
* [[Iraqi National Orchestra]]– Rehearsals and performances were briefly interrupted during the [[Iraq War|Second Gulf War]], but have since returned to normal.
* [[National Theatre of Iraq]]– The theatre was looted during the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], but efforts are underway to restore the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm Five women confront a new Iraq | csmonitor.com]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s when UN [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of [[comedy|comedies]] and [[drama]]tic productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0102-04.htm |title=In Baghdad, Art Thrives As War Hovers |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2003-01-02 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include the [[College or university school of music|Academy of Music]], [[Institute of Fine Arts]] and the [[Music and Ballet school Baghdad]]. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and relics of [[ancient civilization]]s; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.

During the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|2003 occupation of Iraq]], [[AFN Iraq]] (&quot;Freedom Radio&quot;) broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called &quot;Dijlah&quot; (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the [[Jamia]] neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/03/africa/ME-GEN-Iraq-Media-Attacked.php |title=Gunmen storm independent radio station in latest attack against media in Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport ==
Baghdad is home to some of the most successful [[association football|football]] (soccer) teams in Iraq, the biggest being [[Al Quwa Al Jawiya]] (Airforce club), [[Al Zawra]], [[Al Shurta]] (Police) and [[Al Talaba]] (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is [[Al Shaab Stadium]] which was opened in 1966. Another, but much larger stadium, is still in the opening stages of construction.

The city has also had a strong tradition of horseracing ever since World War I, known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''[[Biology]]''' is the study of [[living organisms]]. It is concerned with the characteristics, [[biological classification|classification]], and [[behavior]]s of [[organism]]s, how [[species]] come into [[existence]], and the interactions they have with each other and with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Biology encompasses a broad spectrum of academic fields that are often viewed as independent disciplines. However, together they address [[phenomenon|phenomena]] related to living organisms (biological phenomena) over a wide range of scales, from [[biophysics]] to [[ecology]]. All concepts in biology are subject to the same laws that other branches of science obey, such as the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[conservation of energy]].

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to biology:

{{refimprove|date=September 2009}}

The '''British thermal unit''' (symbol '''BTU''' or '''Btu''') is a traditional unit of [[energy]] equal to about 1,055.05585 [[joule]]s. It is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat {{convert|1|lb|kg|3}} of water from {{convert|39|°F|1}} to {{convert|40|°F|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/British-thermal-unit-Btu.html&lt;/ref&gt; The unit is most often used in the [[Electrical power industry|power]], [[steam]] generation, [[heating]] and [[air conditioning]] industries. In scientific contexts the BTU has largely been replaced by the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of energy, the [[joule]], though it may be used as a measure of agricultural energy production (BTU/kg). It is still used unofficially in [[Metric system|metric]] English-speaking countries (such as [[Canada]]), and remains the standard unit of classification for air conditioning units manufactured and sold in many non-English-speaking metric countries.

In [[North America]], the term &quot;BTU&quot; is used to describe the heat value (energy content) of fuels, and also to describe the [[Power (physics)|power]] of heating and cooling systems, such as furnaces, stoves, barbecue grills, and air conditioners. When used as a unit of power, BTU ''per hour'' (BTU/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just &quot;BTU&quot;.{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}

The unit '''MBTU''' was defined as one thousand BTU, presumably from the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral system]] where &quot;M&quot; stands for one thousand (1,000). This is easily confused with the SI [[Mega-|mega (M)]] prefix, which multiplies by a factor of one million (1,000,000). To avoid confusion many companies and engineers use '''MMBTU''' to represent one million BTU. Alternatively a ''[[therm]]'' is used representing 100,000 or 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTU, and a ''[[quad (energy)|quad]]'' as 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTU.

==Definitions==
A BTU is defined as amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one {{Convert|1|lb|kg|3}} of liquid water by {{convert|1|F-change}} at a constant pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]. As is the case with the [[calorie]], several different definitions of the BTU exist, which are based on different water temperatures and therefore vary by up to 0.5%:
A BTU can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden match&lt;ref&gt;Energy and the Environment.  Ristinen, Robert A.  c.2006, pg 13&lt;/ref&gt; or as the amount of energy it would take to lift a one-pound weight to a height of {{Convert|778|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Energy and the Environment. Ristinen, Robert A. c.2006, pg14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversions==
One BTU is approximately:

* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilo[[joule]]s)
* 0.293071 W·h ([[watt hour]]s)
* 252 to 253&amp;nbsp;cal ([[calorie]]s, or &quot;little calories&quot;)
* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, &quot;large calories,&quot; or &quot;food calories&quot;)
* 25&amp;nbsp;031 to 25&amp;nbsp;160&amp;nbsp;ft·pdl ([[foot-poundal]])
* 778 to 782&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf ([[foot-pound|foot-pounds-force]])

Other conversions:
* In [[natural gas]], by convention 1&amp;nbsp;MMBtu (1 million BTU, sometimes written &quot;mmBTU&quot;) = 1.054615&amp;nbsp;GJ. Conversely, 1 gigajoule is equivalent to 26.8&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas at defined temperature and pressure. So, 1&amp;nbsp;MMBtu = 28.263682&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas at defined temperature and pressure.
* 1 standard cubic foot of natural gas yields ≈ 1030&amp;nbsp;BTU (between 1010&amp;nbsp;BTU and 1070&amp;nbsp;BTU, depending on quality, when burned)

==Associated units==
The BTU per hour (BTU/h) is the unit of power most commonly associated with the BTU. The term is sometimes shortened to BTU hour (BTU.h) but both have the same meaning.

* 1 [[watt]] is approximately 3.41214&amp;nbsp;BTU/h&lt;ref&gt;[http://knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2554&amp;VerticalID=0 2009 ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals (I-P Edition)]. (pp: 38.2). [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]], Inc&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1000&amp;nbsp;BTU/h is approximately 293.071&amp;nbsp;W
* 1 [[horsepower]] is approximately 2,544&amp;nbsp;BTU/h
* 1 &quot;[[ton]] of cooling,&quot; a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is 12,000&amp;nbsp;BTU/h. It is the amount of power needed to melt one [[short ton]] of ice in 24 hours, and is approximately 3.51&amp;nbsp;kW.
* 1 ''[[therm]]'' is defined in the United States and European Union as 100,000&amp;nbsp;BTU—but the U.S. uses the BTU&lt;sub&gt;59&amp;nbsp;°F&lt;/sub&gt; whilst the EU uses the BTU&lt;sub&gt;IT&lt;/sub&gt;.
* 1 ''[[quad (energy)]]'' (short for [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]] BTU) is defined as 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTU, which is about one exajoule (1.055 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J).  Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads/year in 2005. One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts.

The BTU should not be confused with the [[Board of Trade Unit]] (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy (1&amp;nbsp;kW·h, or about 3412&amp;nbsp;BTU).

The BTU is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in BTU required to generate 1 kWh of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500 BTU/kWh, an efficiency of 32-33%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf Electric Generation Efficiency, NPC Global Oil &amp; Gas Study, 18 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bugatti Automobiles [[Société par actions simplifiée|S.A.S.]]''' is a French car brand founded in [[Molsheim]], [[France]] (Germany at that time) as a [[automotive industry|manufacturer]] of [[high performance vehicle|high performance automobiles]] by Italian-born [[Ettore Bugatti]].

The original company is legendary for producing some of the most exclusive cars in the world, as well as some of the fastest. The original Bugatti brand failed with the coming of [[World War II]], like many high-end marques of the time. The death of Ettore's son [[Jean Bugatti|Jean]] was also a contributory factor. The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in the 1960s. Today the name is owned by [[Volkswagen Group]], who have revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive [[sports car]]s.

==Under Ettore Bugatti==
Founder [[Ettore Bugatti]] was born in [[Milan]], Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in the town of [[Molsheim]] located in the [[Alsace]]. The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic way in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), was an important [[Art Nouveau]] furniture and jewelry designer). The company also enjoyed great success in early [[Grand Prix motor racing]], winning the first ever [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. The company's success culminated with driver [[Jean-Pierre Wimille]] winning the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] twice (in 1937 with [[Robert Benoist]] and 1939 with [[Pierre Veyron]]).

===Design===
Bugatti's cars were as much works of art as they were mechanical creations. [[Engine block]]s were [[hand scraper|hand scraped]] to ensure that the surfaces were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured [[Guilloché]] (engine turned) finishes on them, and safety wires threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the [[axle]]s as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed though a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor Bentley's cars as &quot;the world's fastest lorries&quot; for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, &quot;weight was the enemy&quot;.

==Models==
Only a few examples of each of Ettore Bugatti's vehicles were ever produced, the most famous being the [[Bugatti Type 35|Type 35 Grand Prix]] cars, the &quot;[[Bugatti Royale|Royale]]&quot;, the [[Bugatti Type 57|Type 57 &quot;Atlantic&quot;]] and the [[Bugatti Type 55|Type 55]] sports car.

On 2 January 2009, it was revealed that a rare 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante had been found in the garage of a deceased surgeon in England. Only 17 of this model were made, all by hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/02/1937-bugatti-atalante-sup_n_154743.html 1937 Bugatti Atalante Supercar, One of 17, Found in English Garage, Associated Press, January 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2009, a 1925 Bugatti Brescia Type 22 which had lain at the bottom of [[Lake Maggiore]] on the border of Switzerland and Italy for 75 years has been lifted out of the water. The Mullin Museum in [[Oxnard, California]] bought it at auction for $351,343 at Bonham's Retromobile sale in Paris in 2010.

Throughout the production run of approximately 7,900 cars (of which about 2,000 still exist), each Bugatti model was designated with the prefix T for Type, which referred to the chassis and drive train.

During the war Bugatti worked at [[Levallois]] in northwestern suburbs of Paris, on several new projects, including the ''Type 73'' road car, ''Type 73C'' single seater racing car (5 built), and the ''Type 75''. After [[World War II]], a 375&amp;nbsp;cc supercharged car was canceled when Ettore died.

==Racing success==
Bugatti cars were extremely successful in racing, with many thousands of victories in just a few decades. The little [[Bugatti Type 10]] swept the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 [[Bugatti Type 35]] is probably the most successful racing car of all time, with over 2,000 wins. Bugattis swept to victory in the [[Targa Florio]] for five years straight from 1925 through 1929. [[Louis Chiron]] held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the 21st century Bugatti company remembered him with a [[Bugatti Chiron|concept car]] named in his honour. But it was the final racing success at [[24 hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] that is most remembered—[[Jean-Pierre Wimille]] and [[Pierre Veyron]] won the 1939 race with just one car and meagre resources.

==Aviation==
===The Bugatti 100P===
In the 1930s, Ettore Bugatti got involved in the creation of a racer [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]], hoping to beat the Germans in the [[Deutsch de la Meurthe prize]]. This would be the [[Bugatti Model 100|Bugatti 100P]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airventuremuseum.org/collection/aircraft/Bugatti%20Model%20100%20Racer.asp#TopOfPage|title=Bugatti Model 100 at the EAA Museum|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bugattiaircraft.com/plane.htm |title=Bugatti Aircraft Association - 100P Airplane |publisher=Bugattiaircraft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which never flew. It was designed by Belgian engineer [[Louis de Monge]] who had already applied Bugatti Brescia engines in his &quot;Type 7.5&quot; lifting body.

== Railways ==
Ettore Bugatti also designed a successful motorised railcar, the ''[[Autorail]]'' ([[:fr:Autorail Bugatti|Autorail Bugatti]]). 

==The end==
His son, [[Jean Bugatti]], was killed on 11 August 1939 at the age of 30, while testing a [[Bugatti Type 57#Type 57S Tank|Type 57 tank-bodied race car]] near the [[Molsheim]] factory. Subsequently the company's fortunes began to decline. World War II ruined the factory in Molsheim, and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois in [[Paris]] and designed a series of new cars. Ettore Bugatti died on 21 August 1947.

The company attempted a comeback under Roland Bugatti in the mid-1950s with the [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[Bugatti Type 251|Type 251]] race car. Designed with help from famed [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ferrari]], and [[Maserati]] designer [[Gioacchino Colombo]], the car failed to perform to expectations, and the company's attempts at automobile production were halted.

In the 1960s, [[Virgil Exner]] designed a Bugatti as part of his &quot;[[Exner Revival Cars|Revival Cars]]&quot; project. A show version of this car was actually built by [[Ghia]] using the last [[Bugatti Type 101]] chassis, and was shown at the 1965 [[Turin Motor Show]]. Finance was not forthcoming, and Exner then turned his attention to a revival of [[Stutz]].

Bugatti continued manufacturing airplane parts and was sold to [[Hispano-Suiza]] (another auto maker turned aircraft supplier) in 1963. [[Snecma]] took over in 1968, later acquiring [[Messier]]. The two were merged into Messier-Bugatti in 1977.

==Bugatti brand used afterwards==
===Bugatti Automobili SpA===
[[File:2007-06-15 18 Bugatti EB 110 (bearb - kl).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bugatti EB110]] (1996)]]
Italian entrepreneur [[Romano Artioli]] acquired the famous Bugatti name in 1987, and established '''Bugatti Automobili SpA'''. The new company built a factory designed by the architect Giampaolo Benedini in [[Campogalliano]], Italy, a town near [[Modena]], home to other performance-car manufacturers [[De Tomaso]], [[Ferrari]], [[Pagani]] and [[Maserati]].

By 1989 the plans for the new Bugatti revival were presented by Paolo Stanzani and [[Marcello Gandini]], famous designers of the [[Lamborghini Miura]] and [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]]. The first completed car was labelled the [[Bugatti EB110]] GT, advertised as the most technically advanced sports car ever produced.

From 1992 through 1994 famed racing car designer [[Mauro Forghieri]] was technical director.

On 27 August 1993, through his holding company, ACBN Holdings S.A. of [[Luxembourg]], Romano Artioli purchased the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] car company from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]. The acquisition brought together two of the greatest historical names in automotive racing, and plans were made for listing the company's shares on international stock exchanges. Bugatti also presented in 1993 the prototype of a large saloon called the EB112.

By the time the EB110 came to market the North American and European economies were in recession, and operations ceased in September 1995. A model specific to the United States market called the &quot;Bugatti America&quot; was in the preparatory stages when the company closed. Bugatti's liquidators sold Lotus to [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]] of Malaysia.

In 1997 German manufacturer [[Dauer Racing]] bought the EB110 license and remaining parts stock to Bugatti in order to produce five more EB110 SS units, although they were greatly refined by Dauer. The factory was later sold to a furniture-making company, which also collapsed before they were able to move in, leaving the building unoccupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Copyright. Est February 2003. |url=http://www.trade-247.com/80.html |title=Bugatti on TradeTwentyfourSeven website |publisher=Trade-247.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous Bugatti EB110 owner was racing driver [[Michael Schumacher]], seven-time [[Formula One World Champion]], who bought the EB110 in 1994 while racing for the Benetton team. In 2003 Schumacher sold the car&amp;mdash;which had been repaired after a severe crash the year he bought it&amp;mdash;to Modena Motorsport, a Ferrari service and race preparation garage in Germany.

===Bugatti Automobiles===
[[File:Bugatti veyron in Tokyo.jpg|thumb|[[Bugatti Veyron 16.4|Veyron 16.4]].]]
{{main|Bugatti Automobiles}}
[[Volkswagen AG]] purchased the rights to produce cars under the Bugatti marque in 1998. They commissioned [[ItalDesign]] to produce the [[Bugatti EB118]] concept, a touring [[sedan (automobile)|saloon (sedan)]], which featured a {{convert|408|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, and the first [[W engine|W-configuration]] [[W16 engine|16-cylinder engine]] in any passenger vehicle, at the [[Paris Auto Show]].

In 1999, the [[Bugatti EB 218]] concept was introduced at the [[Geneva Auto Show]]; later that year the [[Bugatti 18/3 Chiron]] was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA). At the [[Tokyo Motor Show]], the EB 218 reappeared, and the [[Bugatti Veyron|Bugatti EB 16.4 Veyron]] was presented as the first incarnation of what was to be a production road car.

[[File:Smallpox01.jpg|thumb|350px|Illustration of the Black Death from the [[Toggenburg]] Bible (1411)]]
The '''Black Death''' was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in [[History of the world|human history]], peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350. It is widely thought to have been an outbreak of [[plague (disease)|plague]] caused by the bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', an argument supported by recent forensic research, although this view has been challenged by a number of scholars. Thought to have started in [[China]], it travelled along the [[Silk Road]] and had reached the [[Crimea]] by 1346. From there, probably carried by [[Oriental rat flea]]s residing on the [[black rat]]s that were regular passengers on [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]], it spread throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and Europe. 

The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% – 60% of Europe's population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the [[World population|world's population]] from an estimated 450&amp;nbsp;million to between 350 and 375&amp;nbsp;million in 1400. This has been seen as having created a series of religious, social and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of [[European history]]. It took 150&amp;nbsp;years for Europe's population to recover. The plague returned at various times, killing more people, until it left Europe in the 19th century.

==Overview==
[[File:Holbein-death.png|thumb|Inspired by Black Death, ''[[The Dance of Death]]'' is an allegory on the universality of death and a common painting motif in late medieval period.]]
There have been three major outbreaks of plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] in the 6th and 7th centuries is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of [[bubonic plague]]. From historical descriptions, as much as 40% of the population of [[Constantinople]] died from the plague. Modern estimates suggest half of Europe's population was wiped out before the plague disappeared in the 700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/plague-article.html |title=Plague, Plague Information, Black Death Facts, News, Photos{{–}} National Geographic |publisher=Science.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 750, major epidemic diseases did not appear again in Europe until the Black Death of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Hays (2005). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history]''&quot;. p.23. ISBN 1851096582&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third Pandemic]] hit China in the 1890s and devastated India but was confined to limited outbreaks in the west.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Nicholas Wade]] |coauthors= |title=Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html |quote=|work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 31, 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague is thought to have returned at intervals with varying [[virulence]] and mortality until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/dangerous-diseases-epidemics/bubonic-plague.html |title=Epidemics of the Past: Bubonic Plague—Infoplease.com |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its return in 1603, for example, the plague killed 38,000&amp;nbsp;Londoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Plague |title=Plague{{–}} LoveToKnow 1911 |publisher=1911encyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 17th-century outbreaks were the [[Italian Plague of 1629–1631]], and the [[Great Plague of Seville]] (1647–1652), the [[Great Plague of London]] (1665–1666),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urbanrim.org.uk/plague%20list.htm |title=A list of National epidemics of plague in England 1348-1665 |publisher=Urbanrim.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Plague of Vienna]] (1679). There is some controversy over the identity of the disease, but in its virulent form, after the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] in 1720–1722,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyond.fr/history/plague.html |title=Plague History Provence, - by Provence Beyond |publisher=Beyond.fr |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Great Plague of 1738]] (which hit Eastern Europe), and the [[Russian plague of 1770-1772]], it seems to have gradually disappeared from Europe. By the early 19th century, the threat of plague had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The [[First cholera pandemic|Asiatic cholera]] was the first of several [[cholera]] pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html Cholera's seven pandemics]&quot;.

The 14th century eruption of the Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe's population, irrevocably changing the social structure. It was, arguably, a serious blow to the [[Catholic Church]], and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as [[Antisemitism|Jews]], foreigners, [[beggar]]s, and [[Leprosy|lepers]]. The uncertainty of daily survival has been seen as creating a general mood of morbidity, influencing people to &quot;live for the moment&quot;, as illustrated by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/decameronintro.html Boccaccio: The Decameron, &quot;Introduction&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people called the catastrophe of the 14th century either the &quot;Great Pestilence&quot;' or the &quot;Great Plague&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers contemporary to the plague referred to the event as the &quot;Great Mortality&quot;. Swedish and Danish chronicles of the 16th century described the events as &quot;black&quot; for the first time, not to describe the late-stage sign of the disease, in which the sufferer's skin would blacken due to subepidermal hemorrhages ([[purpura]]), and the extremities would darken with gangrene ([[acral necrosis]]), as the term is more likely to refer to black in the sense of glum, lugubrious, or dreadful as to denote the terribleness and gloom of the events.&lt;ref&gt;S. Barry and N. Gualde, &quot;The Biggest Epidemic of History&quot; (La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire), ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°310, (2006), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The German physician and medical writer [[Justus Hecker]] suggested that a mistranslation of the Latin ''atra mors'' (terrible, or black, death) had occurred in Scandinavia when he described the catastrophe in 1832&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt; in his publication ''&quot;Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert&quot;''. The work was translated into English the following year, and under the influence of the [[cholera]] epidemic of that time, ''&quot;The Black Death in the 14th century&quot;'' gained widespread attention which coined the term ''Schwarzer Tod'' and ''Black Death'' in the German and English speaking worlds, respectively.

==Migration==

===Populations in crisis===
In Europe, the [[Medieval Warm Period]] ended sometime towards the end of the 13th century, bringing the &quot;[[Little Ice Age]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;World Regions in Global Context Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and harsher winters with reduced harvests. In Northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy [[plough]] and the [[Crop rotation|three-field system]] were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they were in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] because the north had poor, clay-like soil.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt; Food shortages and rapidly inflating prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay and consequently livestock, were all in short supply. Their scarcity resulted in [[malnutrition]], which increases susceptibility to infections due to weakened immunity. In the autumn of 1314, heavy rains began to fall, which were the start of several years of cold and wet winters.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt; The already weak harvests of the north suffered and the seven-year famine ensued. In the years 1315 to 1317 a catastrophic [[List of famines|famine]], known as the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]], struck much of [[North-West Europe|North West Europe]]. It was arguably the worst in European history, perhaps reducing the population by more than 10%.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt;

The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', is [[enzootic]] (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground [[rodent]]s, including [[marmots]],  in various areas including [[Central Asia]], Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|1998|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nestorian graves dating to 1338-9 near [[Lake Issyk Kul]] in [[Kyrgizstan]] have inscriptions referring to plague and recent investigations by the Russian archeologist Chwolson show a high incidence rate and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which they could easily have spread to China and India.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, medical geneticists confirmed that the plague came from China.&lt;ref name=china/&gt; In China, the 13th century [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with plague arriving soon after. The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho, &quot;An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China&quot;, in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | first = George C.  | last = Kohn  | title = [http://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present]  | publisher = Infobase Publishing  | year = 2008  | page = 31  | isbn = 0816069352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease  may have traveled along the Silk Road with [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies and traders or it could have come via ship.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8102278/Black-Death-may-have-originated-in-China.html|title=Black Death may have originated in China |publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=1 Nov 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1346 reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: &quot;India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hecker|1859|p=21}} cited by Ziegler, p15&lt;/ref&gt;

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] to infect the inhabitants. The [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders fled, taking the plague by ship into [[Sicily]] and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625094232/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |title=Channel 4{{–}} History{{–}} The Black Death |publisher=Channel4.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.

===European outbreak===
There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. It reached Sicily in October 1347 carried by twelve Genoese galleys.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) ''Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere Vol 1, p.562, cited in {{Ziegler|1998|p=40}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where it rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from Caffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348 but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref&gt;
De Smet, Vol II, ''Breve Chronicon'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Italy]] the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[England]] by June 1348, then turned and spread east through [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] from 1348 to 1350.  It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at [[Askøy]], then proceeded to spread to [[Bjørgvin]] (modern [[Bergen]]) but never reached Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=Iceland's 1100 years: the history of a marginal society|author=Gunnar Karlsson|year=2000|publisher=London:C. Hurst|page=111|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4eRLXJpf2EoC}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it spread to north-western [[Russia]] in 1351. The plague spared some parts of Europe, including the [[Piast Poland#The Kingdom of Later Piasts (1295–1370)|Kingdom of Poland]] and isolated parts of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].

===Middle Eastern outbreak===
The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the [[pandemic]], leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease also entered the region from southern Russia. By autumn 1347, the plague reached [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]], probably through the port's trade with [[Constantinople]], and ports on the [[Black Sea]]. During 1347, the disease traveled eastward to [[Gaza]], and north along the eastern coast to cities in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine]], including [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Sidon]], [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], and [[Aleppo]]. In 1348–49, the disease reached [[Antioch]]. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.

[[Mecca]] became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of [[Mawsil]] (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351, Yemen experienced an outbreak of the plague. This coincided with the return of King Mujahid of [[Yemen]] from imprisonment in [[Cairo]]. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt.
==Symptoms==
[[File:Plague victims blessed by priest.jpg|thumb|A scene showing [[monk]]s, disfigured by the plague, being blessed by a [[priest]]. England, 1360–75]]

Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of [[bubo]]es (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/&gt; [[Boccacio]]'s description is graphic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg...From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite|author=Giovanni Boccacio|title=Decameron|year=1351/3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ziegler comments that the only medical detail that is questionable is the infallibility of approaching death, as if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|1998|p=18,19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died within two to seven days after infection. David Herlihy identifies another potential sign of the plague: freckle-like spots and rashes&lt;ref&gt;D. Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1997) p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; which could be the result of flea-bites. 

Some accounts, like that of Louis Heyligen, a musician in Avignon who died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease which infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/&gt; and which is identified with [[pneumonic plague]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It is said that the plague takes three forms. In the first people suffer an infection of the lungs, which leads to breathing difficulties. Whoever has this corruption or contamination to any extent cannot escape but will die within two days. Another form...in which boils erupt under the armpits,...a third form in which people of both sexes are attacked in the groin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==Causes==
{{Main|Theories of the Black Death}}
Medical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages and the most authoritative account at the time came from the Medical Faculty in Paris in a report to the King of France, which blamed the heavens&amp;mdash;a conjunction of three planets in 1345, which caused a &quot;great pestilence in the air&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horrox|1994|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of &quot;plague tracts&quot; which sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad ''air'' became the most widely accepted theory. It's important to realise that the word ''plague'' had no special significance at this time. But the recurrence of outbreaks during the middle ages gave it a unique reputation and the name has become the medical term.

The importance of hygiene was only recognised in the nineteenth century and until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human fleas and ticks abounding. Any transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One benefit of the black death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in [[Dubrovnik]] in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.
===Plague===
[[File:Yersinia pestis fluorescent.jpeg|thumb|right|''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' seen at 200x magnification. This bacterium, carried and spread by fleas, is generally thought to have been the cause of millions of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avma.org/public_health/biosecurity/plague_bgnd.asp  |title=Plague Backgrounder |publisher=Avma.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080516012329/http://www.avma.org/public_health/biosecurity/plague_bgnd.asp |archivedate = 2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the [[plague (disease)|plague]] theory, which attributes the outbreak to the pathogen responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was [[Alexandre Yersin]], after whom the pathogen was named ''Yersinia pestis''.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005&gt;G. Christakos, ''Interdisciplinary Public Health Reasoning and Epidemic Modelling: the Case of Black Death'' (シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社, 2005), ISBN 3-540-25794-2, pp. 110-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by [[Paul-Louis Simond]] and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose [[midgut]]s had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [[Vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents—one resistant to the disease, who act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second who lack resistance. When the second population die, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; 

The historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]], who had written about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|author=Francis Gasquet|title=The Great Pestilence AD 1348 to 1349: Now Commonly Known As the Black Death|year=1893|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CORQjhbgW9QC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that &quot;it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague&quot; was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the [[Justinian plague]] that was prevalent in the Roman Empire from 541 to 700 AD.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

The modern [[bubonic plague]] has a [[mortality rate]] of thirty to seventy-five percent and symptoms including [[fever]] of 38–41 °[[Celsius|C]] (101–105 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]), [[headache]]s, painful aching joints, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], and a general feeling of [[malaise]]. If untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80% die within eight days.&lt;ref&gt;R. Totaro, ''Suffering in Paradise: The Bubonic Plague in English Literature from More to Milton'' (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonic plague]] has [[mortality rate]] of ninety to ninety-five percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged [[sputum]]. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. [[Septicemic plague]] is the least common of the three forms, with a [[mortality rate]] close to one hundred percent. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), ISBN 0-313-32492-1, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative explanations===
This interpretation was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to directly challenge the bubonic plague theory, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; Supporters of the bubonic plague theory point to the similarity of symptoms, the existence of an established population of [[black rat]]s (''Rattus rattus'') in Europe before the 14th century, the facilitation of the propagation of the disease through the transport of flea-infested goods such as wheat and the discovery of ''Y. pestis'' [[DNA]] in the teeth of bodies from the period in southern French cities.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance and that the DNA testing may be flawed and have not been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; Other arguments include: the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in Northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than modern Bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by between 5 and 15 years, differs from modern Bubonic plague, which often becomes endemic for decades, flaring up on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]
A variety of alternatives to the ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of [[anthrax]] and [[Norman Cantor|N. F. Cantor]] (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as ''hemorrhagic'' plague similar to [[Ebola]]. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; Many scholars arguing for the ''Y. pestis'' as the major agent of the pandemic, suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including [[typhus]], [[smallpox]] and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of &quot;blood poisoning&quot;) and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9&gt;J. P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), ISBN 0-313-32492-1, pp. 21-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
===DNA Evidence===
However, in October 2010 the open-access scientific journal ''PloS Pathogens'' published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of ''Yersinia pestis'' in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt &amp; Raoult in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Their surveys tested for DNA and protein signatures specific for ''Y. pestis'' in human skeletons from widely distributed mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany
[[File:1349 burning of Jews-European chronicle on Black Death.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Burning of [[Jewish people|Jews]] during the Black Death epidemic, 1349]]

:&quot;...ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.&quot;&lt;ref name=Haensch2010/&gt;

The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related [[clade]]s (genetic branches) of the ''Y. pestis'' genome associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains Orientalis and Medievalis, suggesting that the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate that the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed  that the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying that Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in AD 1349 and suggesting that a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities or another site.&lt;ref name=Haensch2010&gt;[http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001134 Stephanie Haensch et al, &quot;Distinct Clones of ''Yersinia pestis'' Caused the Black Death&quot;, ''PloS Pathogens'', 7 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Burning Jews.jpg|thumb|right|A scene showing Jews being burned alive during the period of Black Death, [[Liber Chronicarum]].]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45% to 50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as  Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75% to 80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], (2007) ISBN 978-1-59803-345-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recurrence===
An epidemic of plague dies out after a few months because it has no host in which the bacteria can survive. However that does not mean that there isn't somewhere some surviving infection, in a rodent or flea, that acts as a reservoir so that sooner or later it breaks out again.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Thetriumphofdeath.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' (c.1562) reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed the plague which devastated medieval Europe]]
The Black Death had a profound impact on art and literature throughout the generation that experienced it. Much of the most useful manifestations of the Black Death in literature, to historians, comes from the accounts of its chroniclers. Some of these chroniclers were famous writers, philosophers and rulers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]]. Their writings, however, did not reach the majority of the European population. Petrarch's work was read mainly by wealthy nobles and merchants of Italian [[city-state]]s. He wrote hundreds of letters and vernacular poetry, and passed on to later generations a revised interpretation of [[courtly love]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; There was one [[troubadour]], writing in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, who was active in 1348. [[Peire Lunel de Montech]] composed the sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' &quot;Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens&quot; during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]].

{{quote|How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ships hold and covered with a little earth.|Giovanni Boccaccio&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insecta-inspecta.com/fleas/bdeath/Quotes.html Quotes from the Plague]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biotechnology''' is a field of applied [[biology]] that involves the use of living organisms and bioprocesses in [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[medicine]] and other fields requiring bioproducts. Biotechnology also utilizes these products for manufacturing purpose. Modern use of similar terms includes [[genetic engineering]] as well as [[cell culture|cell-]] and [[tissue culture]] technologies. The concept encompasses a wide range of procedures (and [[history]]) for modifying living organisms according to human purposes — going back to domestication of animals, cultivation of plants, and &quot;improvements&quot; to these through breeding programs that employ [[artificial selection]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]. By comparison to biotechnology, [[bioengineering]] is generally thought of as a related field with its emphasis more on higher systems approaches (not necessarily altering or using biological materials ''directly'') for interfacing with and utilizing living things. The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] defines biotechnology as:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/convention.shtml The Convention on Biological Diversity] (Article 2. Use of Terms).&quot; ''[[United Nations]].'' 1992. Retrieved on February 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;Any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use.&quot;}}

In other term &quot;Application of scientific and technical advances in life science to develop commercial products&quot; is biotechnology.

Biotechnology draws on the pure biological sciences ([[genetics]], [[microbiology]], [[animal cell culture]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[embryology]], [[cell biology]]) and in many instances is also dependent on knowledge and methods from outside the sphere of biology ([[chemical engineering]], [[bioprocess engineering]], [[information technology]], [[biorobotics]]). Conversely, modern biological sciences (including even concepts such as [[molecular ecology]]) are intimately entwined and dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly thought of as the [[life sciences]] industry.

==History==
[[Image:16thCenturyBrewer.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|left|[[Brewing]] was an early application of biotechnology]]

{{Main|History of Biotechnology}}

Biotechnology is not limited to medical/health applications (''unlike'' Biomedical Engineering, which includes much biotechnology). Although not normally thought of as biotechnology, [[agriculture]] clearly fits the broad definition of &quot;''using a biotechnological system to make products''&quot; such that the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise. Agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The processes and methods of agriculture have been refined by other mechanical and biological sciences since its inception. Through early biotechnology, farmers were able to select the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. Other uses of biotechnology were required as the crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain. Specific organisms and organism by-products were used to [[fertilize]], [[nitrogen fixation|restore nitrogen]], and [[pesticide|control pests]]. Throughout the use of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and [[plant breeding|breeding]] them with other plants—one of the first forms of biotechnology. Cultures such as those in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], and [[India]] developed the process of [[brewing]] [[beer]]. It is still done by the same basic method of using malted grains (containing enzymes) to convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer. In this process the carbohydrates in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol. Ancient Indians also used the juices of the plant [[Ephedra vulgaris]] and used to call it [[Soma]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Later other cultures produced the process of [[Lactic acid fermentation]] which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until Pasteur’s work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.

For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.&lt;ref name=Thieman&gt;{{cite book |author=Thieman, W.J.; Palladino, M.A. |title=Introduction to Biotechnology |publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings |year=2008 |isbn=0321491459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of [[microbiology]] and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, [[Chaim Weizmann]] first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing [[corn starch]] using ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]],'' to produce [[acetone]], which the [[United Kingdom]] desperately needed to manufacture [[explosive]]s during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Springham_biotechnology&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Springham, D.; Springham, G.; Moses, V.; Cape, R.E. |title=Biotechnology: The Science and the Business |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9GY5DCr6LD4C |date=24 August 1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9789057024078 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the mold [[Penicillium]]. His work led to the purification of the antibiotic by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley [[penicillin]]. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.&lt;ref name=Thieman/&gt;

The field of modern biotechnology is thought to have largely begun on June 16, 1980, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[microorganism]] could be [[patent]]ed in the case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiamondvChakrabarty&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=447&amp;invol=303 Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). No. 79-139].&quot; ''[[United States Supreme Court]].'' June 16, 1980. Retrieved on May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for [[General Electric]], had developed a bacterium (derived from the ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' genus) capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.

Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008. Another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide, as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=115 IBISWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] estimating [[ethanol]] usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm productivity, biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-3/ The Recession List — Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl... (ith anincreasing share accounted for by ...)], bio-medicine.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:99341.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[rose]] plant that began as cells grown in a tissue culture]]

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non food (industrial) uses of crops and other products (e.g. [[biodegradable plastic]]s, [[vegetable oil]], [[biofuel]]s), and environmental uses.

For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of [[organism]]s for the manufacture of organic products (examples include [[beer]] and [[milk]] products). Another example is using naturally present [[bacteria]] by the mining industry in [[bioleaching]]. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities ([[bioremediation]]), and also to produce [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].

A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology; for example:
* '''[[Bioinformatics]]''' is an interdisciplinary field which addresses biological problems using computational techniques, and makes the rapid organization and analysis of biological data possible. The field may also be referred to as ''computational biology'', and can be defined as, &quot;conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and then applying informatics techniques to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large scale.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gerstein&quot;&gt;Gerstein, M. &quot;[http://www.primate.or.kr/bioinformatics/Course/Yale/intro.pdf Bioinformatics Introduction].&quot; ''[[Yale University]].'' Retrieved on May 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioinformatics plays a key role in various areas, such as [[functional genomics]], [[structural genomics]], and [[proteomics]], and forms a key component in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector.
* '''[[Blue biotechnology]]''' is a term that has been used to describe the marine and aquatic applications of biotechnology, but its use is relatively rare.
* '''[[Green biotechnology]]''' is biotechnology applied to [[agricultural]] processes. An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via [[micropropagation]]. Another example is the designing of [[transgenic plant]]s to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional industrial agriculture. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express a [[pesticide]], thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be [[Transgenic maize|Bt corn]]. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly is a topic of considerable debate.
* '''[[biopharmaceutical|Red biotechnology]]''' is applied to [[medical]] processes. Some examples are the designing of organisms to produce [[antibiotic]]s, and the engineering of genetic cures through [[genetic manipulation]].
* '''[[White biotechnology]]''', also known as industrial biotechnology, is biotechnology applied to [[Industry|industrial]] processes. An example is the designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical. Another example is the using of [[enzymes]] as industrial [[catalyst]]s to either produce valuable chemicals or destroy hazardous/polluting chemicals. White biotechnology tends to consume less in resources than traditional processes used to produce industrial goods.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The investment and economic output of all of these types of applied biotechnologies is termed as '''[[bioeconomy]]'''.

===Medicine===
In medicine, modern biotechnology finds promising applications in such areas as
* [[drug]] production
* [[pharmacogenomics]]
* [[gene therapy]]
* genetic testing (or genetic screening): techniques in molecular biology detect genetic diseases. To test the developing fetus for [[Down syndrome]], [[Amniocentesis]] and [[chorionic villus sampling]] can be used.&lt;ref name=Thieman/&gt;

====Pharmacogenomics====
[[Image:Microarray2.gif|right|thumbnail|250px|[[DNA Microarray]] chip – Some can do as many as a million blood tests at once ]]
{{Main|Pharmacogenomics}}
Pharmacogenomics is the study of how the genetic inheritance of an individual affects his/her body’s response to drugs. It is a coined word derived from the words “[[pharmacology]]” and “genomics”. It is hence the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics. The vision of pharmacogenomics is to be able to design and produce drugs that are adapted to each person’s genetic makeup.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOE&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Energy Human Genome Program, supra note 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacogenomics results in the following benefits:&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOE&quot;/&gt;
# Development of tailor-made medicines. Using pharmacogenomics, pharmaceutical companies can create drugs based on the [[protein]]s, enzymes and [[RNA]] molecules that are associated with specific genes and diseases. These tailor-made drugs promise not only to maximize therapeutic effects but also to decrease damage to nearby healthy cells.
# More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages. Knowing a patient’s genetics will enable doctors to determine how well his/ her body can process and metabolize a medicine. This will maximize the value of the medicine and decrease the likelihood of overdose.
# Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process. The discovery of potential therapies will be made easier using genome targets. Genes have been associated with numerous diseases and disorders. With modern biotechnology, these genes can be used as targets for the development of effective new therapies, which could significantly shorten the drug discovery process.
# Better vaccines. Safer vaccines can be designed and produced by organisms transformed by means of genetic engineering. These vaccines will elicit the immune response without the attendant risks of infection. They will be inexpensive, stable, easy to store, and capable of being engineered to carry several strains of pathogen at once.

====Pharmaceutical products====
[[Image:InsulinHexamer.jpg|250px|thumb|Computer-generated image of insulin hexamers highlighting the threefold [[symmetry]], the [[zinc]] ions holding it together, and the [[histidine]] residues involved in zinc binding.]]

Most traditional pharmaceutical drugs are relatively simple molecules that have been found primarily through trial and error to treat the symptoms of a disease or illness. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} [[Biopharmaceutical]]s are large biological molecules known as [[proteins]] and these usually target the underlying mechanisms and pathways of a malady (but not always, as is the case with using [[insulin]] to treat [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]], as that treatment merely addresses the symptoms of the disease, not the underlying cause which is [[autoimmunity]]); it is a relatively young industry. They can deal with targets in humans that may not be accessible with traditional medicines. A patient typically is dosed with a small molecule ''via'' a tablet while a large molecule is typically injected.

Small molecules are manufactured by chemistry but larger molecules are created by living cells such as those found in the human body: for example, bacteria cells, yeast cells, animal or plant cells.

Modern biotechnology is often associated with the use of genetically altered [[microorganism]]s such as ''[[E. coli]]'' or [[yeast]] for the production of substances like synthetic [[insulin]] or [[antibiotics]]. It can also refer to [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic animals]] or [[transgenic plant]]s, such as [[Bt corn]]. Genetically altered mammalian cells, such as [[Chinese Hamster Ovary cell|Chinese Hamster Ovary]] (CHO) cells, are also used to manufacture certain pharmaceuticals. Another promising new biotechnology application is the development of [[plant-made pharmaceuticals]].

Biotechnology is also commonly associated with landmark breakthroughs in new medical therapies to treat [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[cancers]], [[arthritis]], [[haemophilia]], [[bone fractures]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[cardiovascular]] disorders. The biotechnology industry has also been instrumental in developing molecular diagnostic devices that can be used to define the target patient population for a given biopharmaceutical. [[Herceptin]], for example, was the first drug approved for use with a matching diagnostic test and is used to treat breast cancer in women whose cancer cells express the protein [[HER2]].

Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 [[Genentech]] developed synthetic humanized [[insulin]] by joining its gene with a [[plasmid]] vector inserted into the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of [[abattoir]] animals (cattle and/or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bains, W. |title=Genetic Engineering For Almost Everybody: What Does It Do? What Will It Do? |publisher=Penguin |year=1987 |isbn=0140135014 |page=99 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2003 study undertaken by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) on the access to and availability of insulin in its member countries, synthetic 'human' insulin is considerably more expensive in most countries where both synthetic 'human' and animal insulin are commercially available: e.g. within European countries the average price of synthetic 'human' insulin was twice as high as the price of pork insulin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatlas.idf.org/ IDF 2003; &quot;Diabetes Atlas,: 2nd ed.&quot;; International Diabetes Federation, Brussels], eatlas.idf.org&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in its position statement, the IDF writes that &quot;there is no overwhelming evidence to prefer one species of insulin over another&quot; and &quot;[modern, highly purified] animal insulins remain a perfectly acceptable alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idf.org/home/index.cfm?node=1385 IDF March 2005; &quot;Position Statement.&quot; International Diabetes Federation, Brussels.] idf.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern biotechnology has evolved, making it possible to produce more easily and relatively cheaply [[human growth hormone]], [[clotting factor]]s for [[hemophiliac]]s, [[fertility drug]]s, [[erythropoietin]] and other drugs.&lt;ref name=USIS&gt;U.S. Department of State International Information Programs, “Frequently Asked Questions About Biotechnology”, USIS Online; available from [http://usinfo.state.gov/ei/economic_issues/biotechnology/biotech_faq.html USinfo.state.gov], accessed 13 September 2007. Cf. {{cite journal |author=Feldbaum, C. |title=Some History Should Be Repeated |journal=Science |volume=295 |page=975 |date=February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most drugs today are based on about 500 molecular targets. Genomic knowledge of the genes involved in diseases, disease pathways, and drug-response sites are expected to lead to the discovery of thousands more new targets.&lt;ref name=USIS/&gt;

====Genetic testing====
[[Image:Gel electrophoresis 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Gel electrophoresis]]]]
[[Genetic testing]] involves the direct examination of the [[DNA]] molecule itself. A scientist scans a patient’s DNA sample for mutated sequences.

There are two major types of gene tests. In the first type, a researcher may design short pieces of DNA (“probes”) whose sequences are complementary to the mutated sequences. These probes will seek their complement among the base pairs of an individual’s genome. If the mutated sequence is present in the patient’s genome, the probe will bind to it and flag the mutation. In the second type, a researcher may conduct the gene test by comparing the sequence of DNA bases in a patient’s gene to disease in healthy individuals or their progeny.

Genetic testing is now used for:
* Carrier screening, or the identification of unaffected individuals who carry one copy of a gene for a disease that requires two copies for the disease to manifest;
* Confirmational diagnosis of symptomatic individuals;
* Determining sex;
* Forensic/identity testing;
* Newborn screening;
* Prenatal diagnostic screening;
* Presymptomatic testing for estimating the risk of developing adult-onset cancers;
* Presymptomatic testing for predicting adult-onset disorders.

Some genetic tests are already available, although most of them are used in developed countries. The tests currently available can detect mutations associated with rare genetic disorders like [[cystic fibrosis]], [[sickle cell anemia]], and [[Huntington’s disease]]. Recently, tests have been developed to detect mutation for a handful of more complex conditions such as breast, ovarian, and colon cancers. However, gene tests may not detect every mutation associated with a particular condition because many are as yet undiscovered, and the ones they do detect may present different risks to different people and populations.&lt;ref name=USIS/&gt;

=====Controversial questions=====
[[Image:E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is routinely genetically engineered.]]
The absence of privacy and anti-discrimination legal protections in most countries can lead to discrimination in employment or insurance or other use of personal genetic information. This raises questions such as whether genetic privacy is different from medical privacy.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer and U.S. National Institutes of Health-Department of Energy Working Group on the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) have issued several recommendations to prevent workplace and insurance discrimination. The highlights of these recommendations, which may be taken into account in developing legislation to prevent genetic discrimination, may be found at [http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/ elsi/legislat.html ORNL.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reproductive issues. These include the use of genetic information in reproductive decision-making and the possibility of genetically altering reproductive cells that may be passed on to future generations. For example, germline therapy changes the genetic make-up of an individual’s descendants. Thus, any error in technology or judgment may have far-reaching consequences (though the same can also happen through natural reproduction). Ethical issues like [[designer baby|designed babies]] and human cloning have also given rise to controversies between and among scientists and bioethicists, especially in the light of past abuses with [[eugenics]] (see [[Reductio ad Hitlerum|''reductio ad hitlerum'']]).
# Clinical issues. These center on the capabilities and limitations of doctors and other health-service providers, people identified with genetic conditions, and the general public in dealing with genetic information.
# Effects on social institutions. Genetic tests reveal information about individuals and their families. Thus, test results can affect the dynamics within social institutions, particularly the family.
# Conceptual and philosophical implications regarding human responsibility, free will vis-à-vis genetic determinism, and the concepts of health and disease.

====Gene therapy====
{{Main|Gene therapy}}

[[Image:Gene therapy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Gene therapy using an [[Adenovirus]] vector. A new gene is
inserted into an adenovirus vector, which is used to introduce the modified [[DNA]] into a human cell. If the treatment is successful, the new gene will make a functional [[protein]].]]

Gene therapy may be used for treating, or even curing, genetic and acquired diseases like cancer and AIDS by using normal genes to supplement or replace defective genes or to bolster a normal function such as immunity. It can be used to target [[somatic]] (i.e., body) or [[gametes]] (i.e., egg and sperm) cells. In somatic gene therapy, the genome of the recipient is changed, but this change is not passed along to the next generation. In contrast, in germline gene therapy, the egg and sperm cells of the parents are changed for the purpose of passing on the changes to their offspring.

There are basically two ways of implementing a gene therapy treatment:
# ''Ex vivo'', which means “outside the body” – Cells from the patient’s blood or [[bone marrow]] are removed and grown in the laboratory. They are then exposed to a virus carrying the desired gene. The virus enters the cells, and the desired gene becomes part of the DNA of the cells. The cells are allowed to grow in the laboratory before being returned to the patient by injection into a vein.
# ''In vivo'', which means “inside the body” – No cells are removed from the patient’s body. Instead, vectors are used to deliver the desired gene to cells in the patient’s body.

As of June 2001, more than 500 clinical gene-therapy trials involving about 3,500 patients have been identified worldwide. Around 78% of these are in the United States, with Europe having 18%. These trials focus on various types of cancer, although other multigenic diseases are being studied as well. Recently, two children born with [[severe combined immunodeficiency disorder]] (“SCID”) were reported to have been cured after being given genetically engineered cells.

Gene therapy faces many obstacles before it can become a practical approach for treating disease.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; At least four of these obstacles are as follows:
# ''Gene delivery tools''. Genes are inserted into the body using gene carriers called vectors. The most common vectors now are viruses, which have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering their genes to human cells in a pathogenic manner. Scientists manipulate the genome of the virus by removing the disease-causing genes and inserting the therapeutic genes. However, while viruses are effective, they can introduce problems like toxicity, immune and inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues. In addition, in order for gene therapy to provide permanent therapeutic effects, the introduced gene needs to be integrated within the host cell's genome. Some viral vectors effect this in a random fashion, which can introduce other problems such as disruption of an endogenous host gene.
# ''High costs''. Since gene therapy is relatively new and at an experimental stage, it is an expensive treatment to undertake. This explains why current studies are focused on illnesses commonly found in developed countries, where more people can afford to pay for treatment. It may take decades before developing countries can take advantage of this technology.
# ''Limited knowledge of the functions of genes''. Scientists currently know the functions of only a few genes. Hence, gene therapy can address only some genes that cause a particular disease. Worse, it is not known exactly whether genes have more than one function, which creates uncertainty as to whether replacing such genes is indeed desirable.
# ''Multigene disorders and effect of environment''. Most genetic disorders involve more than one gene. Moreover, most diseases involve the interaction of several genes and the environment. For example, many people with cancer not only inherit the disease gene for the disorder, but may have also failed to inherit specific tumor suppressor genes. Diet, exercise, smoking and other environmental factors may have also contributed to their disease.

====Human Genome Project====
[[Image:Dna-split.png|thumb|right|250px|[[DNA Replication]] image from the Human Genome Project (HGP) ]]

The [[Human Genome Project]] is an initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) that aims to generate a high-quality [[reference genome|reference sequence]] for the entire human genome and identify all the human genes.

The DOE and its predecessor agencies were assigned by the U.S. Congress to develop new energy resources and technologies and to pursue a deeper understanding of potential health and environmental risks posed by their production and use. In 1986, the DOE announced its Human Genome Initiative. Shortly thereafter, the DOE and National Institutes of Health developed a plan for a joint Human Genome Project (“HGP”), which officially began in 1990.

The HGP was originally planned to last 15 years. However, rapid technological advances and worldwide participation accelerated the completion date to 2003 (making it a 13 year project). Already it has enabled gene hunters to pinpoint genes associated with more than 30 disorders.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy Human Genome Program, supra note 6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cloning====
{{Main|Cloning}}

Cloning involves the removal of the nucleus from one cell and its placement in an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed.

There are two types of cloning:
# Reproductive cloning. After a few divisions, the egg cell is placed into a uterus where it is allowed to develop into a fetus that is genetically identical to the donor of the original nucleus.
# Therapeutic cloning.&lt;ref&gt;A number of scientists have called for the use the term “nuclear transplantation,” instead of “therapeutic cloning,” to help reduce public confusion. The term “cloning” has become synonymous with “somatic cell nuclear transfer,” a procedure that can be used for a variety of purposes, only one of which involves an intention to create a clone of an organism. They believe that the term “cloning” is best associated with the ultimate outcome or objective of the research and not the mechanism or technique used to achieve that objective. They argue that the goal of creating a nearly identical genetic copy of a human being is consistent with the term “human reproductive cloning,” but the goal of creating stem cells for regenerative medicine is not consistent with the term “therapeutic cloning.” The objective of the latter is to make tissue that is genetically compatible with that of the recipient, not to create a copy of the potential tissue recipient. Hence, “therapeutic cloning” is conceptually inaccurate. {{cite journal |author=Vogelstein B., Alberts B., Shine K. |title=Please Don’t Call It Cloning! |journal=Science |page=1237 |date=February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The egg is placed into a [[Petri dish]] where it develops into embryonic stem cells, which have shown potentials for treating several ailments.&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cameron D. |title=Stop the Cloning |journal=Technology Review |date=23 May 2002 }} Also available from [http://www.techreview.com Techreview.com], [hereafter “Cameron”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1997, cloning became the focus of media attention when Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute announced the successful cloning of a sheep, named Dolly, from the mammary glands of an adult female. The cloning of Dolly made it apparent to many that the techniques used to produce her could someday be used to clone human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nussbaum, M.C.; Sunstein, C.R. |title=Clones And Clones: Facts And Fantasies About Human Cloning |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1998 |page=11 }} However, there is wide disagreement within scientific circles whether human cloning can be successfully carried out. For instance, Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch of Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research believes that reproductive cloning shortcuts basic biological processes, thus making normal offspring impossible to produce. In normal fertilization, the egg and sperm go through a long process of maturation. Cloning shortcuts this process by trying to reprogram the nucleus of one whole genome in minutes or hours. This results in gross physical malformations to subtle neurological disturbances. Cameron, supra note 30&lt;/ref&gt; This stirred a lot of controversy because of its ethical implications.

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Genetically modified food}}

====Crop yield====
Using the techniques of modern biotechnology, one or two [[gene]]s ([[Smartstax]] from Monsanto in collaboration with Dow AgroSciences will use 8, starting in 2010) may be transferred to a highly developed crop variety to impart a new character that would increase its yield.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank, Agricultural Biotechnology, Poverty Reduction and Food Security (Manila: Asian Development Bank, 2001). Also available from [http://www.adb.org ADB.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, while increases in crop yield are the most obvious applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture, it is also the most difficult one. Current genetic engineering techniques work best for effects that are controlled by a single gene. Many of the genetic characteristics associated with yield (e.g., enhanced growth) are controlled by a large number of genes, each of which has a minimal effect on the overall yield.&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;D. Bruce and A. Bruce, ''Engineering Genesis: The Ethics of Genetic Engineering'', London: Earthscan Publications, 1999 ISBN 1853835706&lt;/ref&gt; There is, therefore, much scientific work to be done in this area.

====Reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses====
Crops containing genes that will enable them to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses may be developed. For example, [[drought]] and excessively salty soil are two important [[limiting factor]]s in crop productivity. Biotechnologists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions in the hope of finding the genes that enable them to do so and eventually transferring these genes to the more desirable crops. One of the latest developments is the identification of a plant gene, [[At-DBF2]], from [[Arabidopsis thaliana]], a tiny weed that is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow and its genetic code is well mapped out. When this gene was inserted into [[tomato]] and [[tobacco]] cells (see [[RNA interference]]), the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold and heat, far more than ordinary cells. If these preliminary results prove successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes can help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/news990527-9|title=Drought stress|author=Sara Abdulla|journal=Nature News|date=27 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also created transgenic rice plants that are resistant to [[rice yellow mottle virus]] (RYMV). In Africa, this virus destroys majority of the rice crops and makes the surviving plants more susceptible to fungal infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Sciences |title=Transgenic Plants and World Agriculture |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increased nutritional qualities====
Proteins in foods may be modified to increase their nutritional qualities. Proteins in legumes and cereals may be transformed to provide the amino acids needed by human beings for a balanced diet.&lt;ref name=Bruce/&gt; A good example is the work of Professors [[Ingo Potrykus]] and [[Peter Beyer]] in creating [[Golden rice]] (discussed below).

====Improved taste, texture or appearance of food====
Modern biotechnology can be used to slow down the process of spoilage so that fruit can ripen longer on the plant and then be transported to the consumer with a still reasonable shelf life. This alters the taste, texture and appearance of the fruit. More importantly, it could expand the market for farmers in developing countries due to the reduction in spoilage. However, there is sometimes a lack of understanding by researchers in developed countries about the actual needs of prospective beneficiaries in developing countries. For example, engineering soybeans to resist spoilage makes them less suitable for producing [[tempeh]] which is a significant source of protein that depends on fermentation. The use of modified soybeans results in a lumpy texture that is less palatable and less convenient when cooking.

The first genetically modified food product was a tomato which was transformed to delay its ripening.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of the research and development of Flavr Savr tomato, see {{cite book |author=Martineau, B. |title=First Fruit: The Creation of the Flavr Savr Tomato and the Birth of Biotech Food |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Vietnam]] are currently working on delayed-ripening papaya in collaboration with the [[University of Nottingham]] and [[Zeneca]].&lt;ref&gt;A.F. Krattiger, An Overview of ISAAA from 1992 to 2000, ISAAA Brief No. 19-2000, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology in cheese production:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europabio.org/documents/cheese.pdf EuropaBio — An animal friendly alternative for cheeze makers], Europabio.org&lt;/ref&gt; enzymes produced by micro-organisms provide an alternative to animal rennet – a cheese coagulant – and an alternative supply for cheese makers. This also eliminates possible public concerns with animal-derived material, although there are currently no plans to develop synthetic milk, thus making this argument less compelling. Enzymes offer an animal-friendly alternative to animal rennet. While providing comparable quality, they are theoretically also less expensive.

About 85 million tons of wheat flour is used every year to bake bread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europabio.org/documents/painbread.pdf EuropaBio — Biologically better bread], Europabio.org&lt;/ref&gt; By adding an enzyme called maltogenic amylase to the flour, bread stays fresher longer. Assuming that 10–15% of bread is thrown away as stale, if it could be made to stay fresh another 5–7 days then perhaps 2 million tons of flour per year would be saved. Other enzymes can cause bread to expand to make a lighter loaf, or alter the loaf in a range of ways.

====Reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals====
Most of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are on reducing the dependence of farmers on [[agrochemical]]s. For example, ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein with insecticidal qualities. Traditionally, a fermentation process has been used to produce an insecticidal spray from these bacteria. In this form, the [[Bt toxin]] occurs as an inactive [[protoxin]], which requires digestion by an insect to be effective. There are several Bt toxins and each one is specific to certain target insects. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When a susceptible insect ingests the transgenic crop cultivar expressing the Bt protein, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control [[corn borer]] (a lepidopteran insect), which is otherwise controlled by spraying (a more difficult process).

Crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to broad-spectrum [[herbicide]]. The lack of herbicides with broad-spectrum activity and no crop injury was a consistent limitation in crop [[Weed control|weed management]]. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides were routinely used to control a wide range of weed species detrimental to agronomic crops. Weed management tended to rely on preemergence—that is, herbicide applications were sprayed in response to expected weed infestations rather than in response to actual weeds present. Mechanical cultivation and hand weeding were often necessary to control weeds not controlled by herbicide applications. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops has the potential of reducing the number of herbicide active ingredients used for weed management, reducing the number of herbicide applications made during a season, and increasing yield due to improved weed management and less crop injury. Transgenic crops that express tolerance to [[glyphosate]], [[glufosinate]] and [[bromoxynil]] have been developed. These herbicides can now be sprayed on transgenic crops without inflicting damage on the crops while killing nearby weeds.&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Gianessi, C. S. Silvers, S. Sankula and J. E. Carpenter. [http://croplife.intraspin.com/Biotech/plant-biotechnology-current-and-potential-impact-for-improving-pest-management-in-u-s-agriculture-an-analysis-of-40-case-studies/ Plant Biotechnology: Current and Potential Impact for Improving Pest management in US Agriculture, An Analysis of 40 Case Studies] (Washington, D.C.: National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, 2002), 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2001, herbicide tolerance was the most dominant trait introduced to commercially available transgenic crops, followed by insect resistance. In 2001, herbicide tolerance deployed in [[soybean]], [[maize|corn]] and [[cotton]] accounted for 77% of the 626,000 square kilometres planted to transgenic crops; Bt crops accounted for 15%; and &quot;stacked genes&quot; for herbicide tolerance and insect resistance used in both cotton and corn accounted for 8%.&lt;ref&gt;C. James, “Global Review of Commercialized Transgenic Crops: 2002”, ISAAA Brief No. 27-2002, at 11–12. Also available from [http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/default.html ISAAA.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Production of novel substances in crop plants====
Biotechnology is being applied for novel uses other than food. For example, [[oilseed]] can be modified to produce fatty acids for [[detergent]]s, substitute [[fuel]]s and [[petrochemical]]s. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[rice]] [[tobacco]], [[lettuce]], [[safflower]]s, and other plants have been genetically engineered to produce [[insulin]] and certain [[vaccine]]s. If future clinical trials prove successful, the advantages of edible [[vaccine]]s would be enormous, especially for developing countries. The transgenic plants may be grown locally and cheaply. Homegrown vaccines would also avoid logistical and economic problems posed by having to transport traditional preparations over long distances and keeping them cold while in transit. And since they are edible, they will not need syringes, which are not only an additional expense in the traditional vaccine preparations but also a source of infections if contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10757–8 |title= Vaccines are for dinner |author= Pascual DW |doi=10.1073/pnas.0704516104 |pmid=17581867 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/26/10757 |pmc= 1904143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of insulin grown in transgenic plants, it is well-established that the gastrointestinal system breaks the protein down therefore this could not currently be administered as an edible protein. However, it might be produced at significantly lower cost than insulin produced in costly bioreactors. For example, Calgary, Canada-based SemBioSys Genetics, Inc. reports that its safflower-produced insulin will reduce unit costs by over 25% or more and approximates a reduction in the capital costs associated with building a commercial-scale insulin manufacturing facility of over $100 million, compared to traditional biomanufacturing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sembiosys.ca/ SemBioSys.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animal Biotechnology====
In animals, biotechnology techniques are being used to improve genetics and for pharmaceutical or industrial applications. Molecular biology techniques can help drive breeding programs by directing selection of superior animals. Animal cloning, through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), allows for genetic replication of selected animals. Genetic engineering, using recombinant DNA, alters the genetic makeup of the animal for selected purposes, including producing therapeutic proteins in cows and goats. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= California Agriculture|year=2006 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=132–139 |title= What is the Future of Animal Biotechnology?|author= Van Eenennaam, AL |url=http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/animalbiotech/My_Laboratory/Publications/futureanimalbiotech.pdf |doi= 10.3733/ca.v060n03p132}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a genetically altered salmon with an increased growth rate being considered for FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nature Biotechnology|year=2005 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=283–285|title= Clone on the Range:What Animal Biotech is Bringing to the Table |author= Dove, AW |doi= 10.1038/nbt0305-283 |pmid= 15765075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


====Criticism====
There is another side to the agricultural biotechnology issue. It includes increased [[herbicide]] usage and resultant herbicide resistance, &quot;super weeds,&quot; residues on and in food crops, genetic contamination of non-GM crops which hurt organic and conventional farmers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Monsanto_and_the_Roundup_Ready_Controversy Monsanto and the Roundup Ready Controversy], — SourceWatch.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Monsanto Monsanto], — SourceWatch.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological engineering===
{{Main|Bioengineering}}
Biotechnological engineering or biological engineering is a branch of [[engineering]] that focuses on biotechnologies and biological science. It includes different disciplines such as [[biochemical engineering]], [[biomedical engineering]], bio-process engineering, biosystem engineering and so on. Because of the novelty of the field, the definition of a [[bioengineer]] is still undefined. However, in general it is an integrated approach of fundamental [[biological sciences]] and traditional engineering principles.

Biotechnologists are often employed to scale up bio processes from the laboratory scale to the manufacturing scale. Moreover, as with most engineers, they often deal with management, economic and legal issues. Since [[patents]] and regulation (e.g., [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] regulation in the U.S.) are very important issues for biotech enterprises, bioengineers are often required to have knowledge related to these issues.

The increasing number of biotech enterprises is likely to create a need for bioengineers in the years to come. Many universities throughout the world are now providing programs in bioengineering and biotechnology (as independent programs or specialty programs within more established engineering fields).

===Bioremediation and biodegradation===
{{Main|Microbial biodegradation}}
Biotechnology is being used to engineer and adapt [[organisms]] especially [[microorganisms]] in an effort to find sustainable ways to clean up contaminated environments. The elimination of a wide range of pollutants and wastes from the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] is an absolute requirement to promote a sustainable development of our society with low environmental impact. Biological processes play a major role in the removal of [[contaminant]]s and biotechnology is taking advantage of the astonishing catabolic versatility of microorganisms to degrade/convert such compounds. New methodological breakthroughs in [[sequencing]], [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[bioinformatics]] and imaging are producing vast amounts of information. In the field of Environmental Microbiology, [[genome]]-based global studies open a new era providing unprecedented ''in silico'' views of metabolic and regulatory networks, as well as clues to the evolution of [[microbial biodegradation|degradation]] pathways and to the molecular adaptation strategies to changing environmental conditions. Functional genomic and metagenomic approaches are increasing our understanding of the relative importance of different pathways and regulatory networks to [[carbon flux]] in particular environments and for particular compounds and they will certainly accelerate the development of [[bioremediation]] technologies and [[biotransformation]] processes.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;{{cite book|author = Diaz E (editor).|title = Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|edition = 1st|publisher = Caister Academic Press|year = 2008|url=http://www.horizonpress.com/biod|id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/biod|isbn = 1904455174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine environments are especially vulnerable since oil spills of coastal regions and the open sea are poorly containable and mitigation is difficult. In addition to pollution through human activities, millions of tons of petroleum enter the marine environment every year from natural seepages. Despite its toxicity, a considerable fraction of petroleum oil entering marine systems is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCCB).&lt;ref name=chapter9&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/biod|author=Martins VAP et al|year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.lefitummidi.webs.com/biod |isbn=978-1-904455-17-2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biotechnology regulations===
The National Institute of Health was the first federal agency to assume regulatory responsibility in the United States. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the NIH published guidelines for working with recombinant DNA and recombinant organisms in the laboratory. Nowadays, the agencies that are responsible for the biotechnology regulation are: [[US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) that regulates plant pests and medical preparation from living organisms, [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) that regulates pesticides and herbicides, and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) which ensures that the food and drug products are safe and effective &lt;ref name=Thieman/&gt;

===Education===
In 1988, after prompting from the [[United States Congress]], the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] ([[National Institutes of Health]]) instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish [[Biotechnology Training Program]]s (BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed. [[Graduate students]] in turn compete for acceptance into a BTP; if accepted then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their [[PhD]] thesis work. Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/PredocInst-Biotechnology.htm NIGMS.NIH.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges.

The '''Battle of Poitiers''' was fought between the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] on 19 September 1356 near [[Poitiers]], resulting in the second of the three great English victories of the [[Hundred Years' War]]: [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], Poitiers, and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]].

==Background==
On 8 August 1356, [[Edward, the Black Prince]] began a great ''[[chevauchée]]'' (raid) north from the English base in [[Aquitaine]], in an effort to relieve allied garrisons in central France, as well as to raid and ravage the countryside.  His sortie met little resistance, his Anglo-[[Gascony|Gascon]] forces burning numerous towns to the ground and living off the land, until they reached the [[Loire River]] at [[Tours]]. His forces were unable to take the castle nor could they burn the town, due to a heavy downpour.  His delay there allowed [[John II of France|John II]], [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], to attempt to catch Edward's army and eliminate it.  The King, who had been confronting [[Henry of Grosmont]] in [[Normandy]], arranged the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of the besieged Tours, dismissing around 15,000–20,000 of his lower-quality [[infantry]] to increase the speed of his forces.

Upon receiving reports of the French army on the move, Edward decided a retreat was in order.  He marched south pursued in earnest by John.  The French caught up to the English a few miles southwest of [[Poitiers]].  A veteran of the battle of Crécy, at which he had fought when he was only sixteen years old, the Black Prince decided on the same tactical scheme employed at that earlier battle. He positioned his troops in a strongly defensive position, in a plain surrounded by natural obstacles, such as a creek on the left and a wood on the back. The luggage wagons, with a great amount of plunder, remained along the old [[Roman road]], the main route from Poitiers to [[Bordeaux]], to give protection to his weak right side. All his men dismounted and were organized in two, or perhaps three units, with [[English longbow|longbowmen]] placed in a V-formation on both flanks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_battle_crecy.html The Battle of Crécy, by Jonathan Blair, referencing ''Armies of Crecy and Poitiers (Men-At-Arms Series, No 111)'', by Christopher Rothero]&lt;/ref&gt; and a small [[cavalry]] unit, commanded by Jean de Grailly, the [[Captal de Buch]], hidden in woods at the rear.  

The attacking French forces were divided in four parts. At the front were around 300 elite [[knight]]s{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}, commanded by general Clermont and accompanied by German [[mercenary]] [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]]. The purpose of this group was to charge the archers and eliminate the threat they posed. These were followed by three groups of infantry ([[Dragoon|dismounted cavalry]]) commanded by the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin (later Charles V of France)]], the [[Philip of Valois, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]] and King John.

==The battle==
[[File:The battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=painting|The Battle of Poitiers]]
At the beginning of the battle, the English simulated flight on their left wing. This provoked a hasty charge by the French knights against the archers. However, the English were expecting this and quickly attacked the enemy, especially the horses, with a shower of arrows. Prominent chronicler [[Jean Froissart]] writes that the French armour was invulnerable to the English arrows, that the arrowheads either skidded off the armor or shattered on impact. English history of the battle disputes this, as some claim that the narrow [[bodkin point]] arrows they used have been proven capable of penetrating most [[plate armour]] of that time period. While tests have been done to support this with fixed pieces of flat metal, the result is inconclusive with respect to the curved armour of the period. Given the following actions of the archers, it seems likely Froissart was correct. The armour on the horses was weaker on the sides and back, so the archers moved to the sides of the cavalry and shot the horses in the flanks.  This was a popular method of stopping a cavalry charge, as a falling horse often destroyed the cohesion of the enemy's line. The results were devastating. 

This attack was followed by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s infantry, who engaged in heavy fighting, but withdrew to regroup. The next wave of infantry under [[Duke of Orléans|Orléans]], seeing that the Dauphin's men were not attacking, turned back and panicked. This stranded the forces led by the King himself. This was a formidable fighting force, and the English archers were out of arrows: the archers joined the infantry in the fight and some of both groups mounted horses to form an improvised cavalry. Combat was hard, but the Black Prince still had a mobile reserve hidden in the woods, which was able to circle around and attack the French in the flank and rear. The French were fearful of encirclement and attempted to flee. King John was captured with his immediate entourage only after a memorable resistance. 

Amongst the notable casualties according to Froissart were:
* King John II of France, captured.
* Prince [[Philip the Bold|Philip]], the King's youngest son and progenitor of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]], captured
* [[Peter I, Duke of Bourbon]], killed.
* [[Walter VI, Count of Brienne]] and [[Constable of France]], killed.
* [[Jean de Clermont]], [[Marshal of France]], killed
* [[Arnoul d'Audrehem]], Marshal of France, captured.
* The [[John of Artois, Count of Eu|Count of Eu]], wounded and captured.
* The [[James I, Count of La Marche|Count of Marche and Ponthieu]], captured.
* The [[Louis II d'Évreux|Count of Étampes]], captured.
* The Count of Tancarville, captured.
* The Count of Dammartin, captured.
* The Count of Joinville, captured.
* Guillaume de Melun, [[Archbishop of Sens]], captured
* [[Geoffroi de Charny]], carrier of the [[Oriflamme]], killed.

The Duke of Bourbon and the Counts of Étampes, Eu and Marche were members of junior branches of the [[House of Capet]].

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Capture de Jean le Bon.jpg|thumb|200px|John II, the Good, being captured.]]
The result was a decisive [[Plantagenet]] victory, and a catastrophe for the Valois. France was asked to pay a [[ransom]] equivalent to twice the country's yearly income to have the King returned. John, who was accorded royal privileges [[Ransom of King John II of France|whilst being a prisoner]], was permitted to return to France to try to raise the required funds. Dissatisfaction of the commons over this arrangement, and having to bear the burden of the ransom, shortly led to the [[Jacquerie|Jacquerie Revolt]]. Following some time in France John subsequently handed himself back to the English, claiming to be unable to pay the ransom, and died a few months later. Finally, only one-fifth of the ransom was paid. In many ways, Poitiers was a repeat of the battle of [[Crécy]] showing once again that a good defensive tactic can overcome a disadvantage in numbers.  As the Black Prince wrote shortly afterward in a letter to the people of London: 

{{quote|[I]t was agreed that we should take our way, flanking them, in such a manner that if they wished for battle or to draw towards us, in a place not very much to our disadvantage, we should be the first&amp;nbsp;... the enemy was discomfited, and the king was taken, and his son; and a great number of other great people were both taken and slain[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Amt, Emilie, ed. | title= Medieval England 1000–1500: A Reader | publisher=Broadview Press | location=Peterborough, Ontario | year =2001 | isbn=1-55111-244-2 |page= 335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The new French King [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] &quot;the Wise&quot; learnt the lesson from Crécy and Poitiers. When he resumed the war against the English in 1370, he named the great tactician [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] as [[Constable of France]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''backbone [[cabal]]''' was an informal organization of large-site [[Sysop|administrators]] of the worldwide distributed [[Internet]] discussion system [[Usenet]]. It existed from about 1983 at least into the 2000s.

The cabal was created in an effort to facilitate reliable propagation of new Usenet posts:  While in the 1970s and 1980s many news servers only operated during night time to save on the cost of long distance communication, servers of the backbone cabal were available 24 hours a day. The administrators of these servers gained sufficient influence in the otherwise anarchic Usenet community to be able to push through controversial changes, for instance the [[Great Renaming]] of [[Usenet]] newsgroups during the 1980s.

== History ==
As Usenet has few technologically or legally enforced hierarchies, just about the only ones that formed were [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]]. People acquired power through persuasion, exerted both publicly and privately, public debate, force of will (often via aggressive [[flaming (internet)|flames]]), garnering authority and respect by spending much time and effort contributing to the community (by being a maintainer of a [[FAQ]], for example; see also [[James Parry|Kibo]], etc.).

Credit for organizing the backbone about 1983 is commonly attributed to [[Gene Spafford|Gene &quot;Spaf&quot; Spafford]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20021012011241/http://www.vrx.net/usenet/history/rename.html The Great Renaming FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also claimed by [[Mary Ann Horton|Mark Horton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryannhorton.com/MaryAnnHorton-extended.html Mary Ann Horton's Resumé]&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members of the cabal were [[Brian Reid]], [[Richard Sexton]], [[Chuq von Rospach]] and [[Rick Adams (Internet pioneer)|Rick Adams]].

== In Internet culture ==
During most of its existence, the cabal (sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied its own existence; those involved would often respond '''&quot;There is no Cabal&quot;''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''&quot;TINC&quot;'''), whenever the existence or activities of the group were speculated on in public. It is sometimes used humorously to dispel cabal-like organizational conspiracy theories, or as an ironic statement, indicating one who knows the existence of &quot;the cabal&quot; will invariably deny there is one.

This belief became a model for various conspiracy theories about various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over Usenet or the Internet. [[Website spoofing|Spoofs]] include the [http://catb.org/~esr/ecsl/index.html &quot;Eric Conspiracy&quot;] of moustachioed hackers named &quot;Eric&quot;; ex-members of the [[P.H.I.R.M.]]; and the [[Lumber Cartel]] putatively funding anti-[[spamming|spam]] efforts to support the paper industry.

The result of this policy was an aura of mystery, even a decade after the cabal mailing list disbanded in late 1988 following an internal fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=backbone+cabal |title=backbone cabal |publisher=TechWeb|accessdate=2007-09-07 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''western or lowland bongo''', ''Tragelaphus eurycerus eurycerus'', is a [[herbivorous]], mostly [[nocturnal]] forest [[ungulate]] and among the largest of the African forest [[antelope]] [[species]].

Bongos are characterised by a striking reddish-brown coat, black and white markings, white-yellow stripes and long slightly spiralled horns. Indeed, bongos are the only [[Tragelaphus|Tragelaphid]] in which both sexes have horns.  Bongos have a complex social interaction and are found in African dense forest mosaics.

The lowland bongo faces an ongoing population decline and the [[IUCN]] Antelope Specialist Group considers the western or lowland bongo, ''T. eurycerus eurycerus'', to be [[Near Threatened]] on the [[conservation status]] scale.

The '''eastern or mountain bongo''', ''T. eurycerus isaaci'', of [[Kenya]] has a coat even more vibrant than that of ''T. eurycerus eurycerus''. The mountain bongo is only found in the wild in one remote region of central Kenya. The mountain bongo is classified by the IUCN Antelope Specialist Group as [[Critically Endangered]] with more specimens in captivity than in the wild.

In 2000, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan (SSP) Participant and in 2006 named the Bongo Restoration to Mount Kenya Project to its list of the Top Ten Wildlife Conservation Success Stories of the year.

==Taxonomy==
The bongo belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Tragelaphus]]'', which includes the [[sitatunga]] (''Tragelaphus spekeii''), the [[nyala]] (''Tragelaphus angasii''), the [[bushbuck]] (''Tragelaphus scriptus''), the [[mountain nyala]] (''Tragelaphus buxtoni''), the [[Lesser Kudu]] (''Tragelaphus imberbis'') and the [[greater kudu]] (''Tragelaphus strepsiceros'').

Bongos are further classified into two [[subspecies]]: ''Tragelaphus eurycerus eurycerus'', the lowland or &quot;western bongo&quot;, and the far rarer ''Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci'', the mountain or &quot;eastern bongo&quot; restricted to north-eastern Central Africa. The eastern bongo is larger and heavier than the western bongo. Two other subspecies are described from West and Central Africa, but taxonomic clarification is required. They have been observed to live up to 19 years.&lt;ref&gt;Spinage, C.A. The Natural History of Antelopes. New York: Facts on File Publications, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific name ''Tragelaphus eurycerus'' is acquired from Greek words: &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;trago&quot; (a he-goat), and &quot;elaphos&quot; (a deer), in combination referring to &quot;an antelope&quot;. The word &quot;eurycerus&quot; is originated from the fusion of &quot;eurus&quot; (broad, widespread) and &quot;keras&quot; (an animal's horn). &quot;Bongo&quot; is derived from a West African native name.

Bongos are one of the largest of the forest antelopes. In addition to the deep [[chestnut]] colour of their coats, they have bright white stripes on their sides to help [[camouflage]] them from their enemies.

[[Gestation]] is approximately 285&amp;nbsp;days (9.5&amp;nbsp;months) with one young per birth with [[weaning]] at 6 months. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 24–27&amp;nbsp;months. 

Adults of both sexes are similar in size. Adult height is about 1.1-1.3&amp;nbsp;meters (3&amp;nbsp;ft 8&amp;nbsp;in-4&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in) and length is 1.7-2.5&amp;nbsp;meters (5&amp;nbsp;ft 8&amp;nbsp;in-8&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in). Females weigh approximately 210–235&amp;nbsp;kg (460-520&amp;nbsp;lb), while males weigh approximately 240–405&amp;nbsp;kg (530 to 895&amp;nbsp;lb). Its large size puts it as the third largest in the Bovidae tribe of Strepsicerotini; behind both the Common and Greater Eland by two hundred kilos, and above the Greater Kudu by two hundred kilos.

Both sexes have heavy spiral horns—those of the male are longer and more massive. All bongos in captivity are from the isolated [[Aberdare Mountains]] of central [[Kenya]].

==Distribution and habitat==
Bongos are found in dense [[tropical]] [[jungle]]s with dense undergrowth up to an altitude of 4,000&amp;nbsp;meters (12,800&amp;nbsp;ft) in Central Africa, with isolated populations in Kenya, and the following west African countries: -

[[Image:Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaciPCCA20071227-8374B.jpg|left|180px|thumb|A bongo drinks from a [[swamp]].]][[Angola]], [[Benin]] [regionally extinct?], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Kenya]] (the '''''only''''' place where the eastern bongo are found in the wild), [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], [[Togo]] [regionally extinct?] and [[Uganda]] [regionally extinct] (IUCN, 2002).

Historically, bongos occurred in three disjunct parts of Africa: East, Central and West. Today all three populations’ ranges have shrunk in size due to habitat loss for agriculture and uncontrolled timber cutting as well as [[hunting]] for [[meat]].

Bongos favour disturbed forest mosaics that provide fresh, low-level green vegetation. 

Such habitats may be promoted by heavy browsing by [[African elephant|elephants]], fires, flooding, tree-felling (natural or by logging) and [[fallowing]]. Mass [[bamboo]] die-off provides ideal habitat in East Africa.

==Appearance==
===Coat and body===
[[Image:BongoNEW.jpg|thumb|left|Showing the side facial patination of an eastern bongo.]] The bongo sports a bright [[auburn hair|auburn]] or [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]] coat, with the neck, chest and legs generally darker than the rest of the body. Coats of male bongos become darker and buffy as they age until they reach a dark [[mahogany]]-brown colour. Coats of female bongos are usually more brightly coloured than those of males.

The pigmentation in the coat rubs off quite easily &amp;mdash; there are [[anecdotal]] reports that rain running off a bongo may be tinted red with [[pigment]]. The smooth coat is marked with 10&amp;ndash;15 vertical white-yellow stripes, spread along the back from the base of the neck to the rump. The number of stripes on each side is rarely the same. It also has a short, bristly and vertical brown ridge of hair along the spine from the shoulder to the rump; the white stripes run into this ridge.

A white chevron appears between the eyes and two large white spots grace each cheek. There is another white chevron where the neck meets the chest. The large ears are to sharpen hearing, and the distinctive coloration may help bongos identify one another in their dark forest habitats. Bongos have no special secretion glands and so rely less on scent to find one another than do other similar antelopes. The lips of a bongo are white, topped with a black muzzle.

===Horns===
[[Image:Bongo Burger Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|A western bongo's horns]]
Bongos have two heavy and slightly spiralled [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] that slope over their back and like in many other [[antelope]] species, both the male and female bongos have horns. Bongos are the only [[Tragelaphus|Tragelaphids]] in which both sexes have horns. The horns of bongos are in the form of a [[lyre]] and bear a resemblance to those of the related [[antelope]] species of [[nyala]]s, [[sitatunga]]s, [[bushbuck]]s, [[kudu]]s and [[Taurotragus|elands]].

Unlike [[deer]], which have branched [[antler]]s that they shed annually, bongos and other [[antelope]]s have pointed horns that they keep throughout their lifespan. Males have massive backswept horns while females have smaller, thinner and more parallel horns. The size of the horns range between 75 and 99 centimetres (30–39&quot;). The horns twist once.

Like all other horns of [[antelope]]s, the core of a bongo's horn is hollow and the outer layer of the horn is made of [[keratin]], the same material that makes up human fingernails, toenails and hair. The bongo runs gracefully and at full speed through even the thickest tangles of [[lianas]], laying its heavy spiralled horns on its back so that the brush cannot impede its flight. Bongos are hunted for their horns by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, F. R. 1990. Spiral-horned antelopes. In Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals. Edited by S. P. Parker. New York: McGraw-Hill. Volume 5, pp. 344-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social organization and behavior==
[[Image:Mountain bongo mount kenya.jpg|thumb|left|This female eastern bongo presents her hindquarters while looking over her shoulder to check for threats at Mt. Kenya Wildlife Conservancy.]]Like other forest [[ungulates]], bongos are seldom seen in large groups. Males, called bulls, tend to be solitary while groups of females with young live in groups of 6&amp;nbsp;to 8. Bongos have seldom been seen in herds of more than 20. The preferred habitat of this species is so dense and difficult to operate in that few Europeans or Americans observed this species until the 1960s. Current living animals derive solely from Kenyan importations made during the period 1969&amp;ndash;1978.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, Jonathan. East African Mammals Vol. IIIC. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
As young males mature and leave their maternal groups they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join-up with an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner and rarely serious fights will take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly pacing back and forth in front of the other male. They seek out females only during mating time.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, Richard D. The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.

Although mostly [[nocturnal]], they are occasionally active during the day. However, like deer, it may be that bongos may exhibit [[crepuscular]] behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. They seek cover, where they stand still and alert, facing away from the disturbance and turning their heads from time to time to check on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinage, C.A. The Natural History of Antelopes. New York: Facts on File Publications, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.

When in distress the bongo emits a [[bleat]]. It uses a limited number of vocalisations, mostly grunts and snorts while females have a weak mooing contact-call for their young. Females prefer to use traditional [[Birth|calving]] grounds restricted to certain areas, while newborn calves lie in hiding for a week or more, receiving short visits by the mother to [[Breastfeeding|suckle]].&lt;ref&gt;Estes, Richard. The Safari Companion. Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing Co., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calves grow rapidly and can soon accompany their mothers in the nursery herds. Their horns grow rapidly and begin to show in 3.5 months. They are weaned after six months and reach sexual maturity at about 20 months.

==Diet==
[[Image:BongoP2.jpg|thumb|upright|A male bongo eating grass at [[Louisville Zoo]]]]
Like many forest [[ungulates]] bongos are [[herbivorous]] browsers and feed on tree/bush [[leaves]], [[bushes]], [[vine]]s, [[bark]] and pith of rotting trees, [[grasses]]/herbs, [[root]]s, [[cereals]], [[shrubs]] and [[fruits]].

Bongos require [[salt]] in their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and are known to regularly visit natural salt licks. Examination of bongo feces revealed that the charcoal from trees burnt by lightning is consumed. They have been known to eat burned wood after [[lightning]] [[storms]]. This behavior is believed to be a means of getting salts and [[minerals]] into their diet (See Animal Diversity link 2). This behavior has also been reported in the [[okapi]]. Another similarity to the okapi, even though the bongo is unrelated, is that the bongo has a long [[prehensile]] tongue which it uses to grasp grasses and leaves.

Suitable habitats for bongos must have permanent water available.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, Ronald M. Walker's Mammals of the World Fifth Ed. Vol. II. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press., 1991&lt;/ref&gt; A large animal, the bongo requires an ample amount of food, and is restricted to areas with abundant year-round growth of herbs and low shrubs. Such restrictions have been said to account for the animal's limited distribution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Population and conservation==
Few estimates of population density are available. Assuming average population densities of 0.25 animals per km² in regions where it is known to be common or abundant, and 0.02 per km² elsewhere, and with a total area of occupancy of 327,000&amp;nbsp;km², a total population estimate of approximately 28,000 is suggested. Only about 60% are in protected areas, suggesting that actual numbers of the lowland subspecies may only be in the low tens of thousands. In Kenya, their numbers have declined significantly and on [[Mt. Kenya]], they were [[Wiktionary:extirpate|extirpated]] within the last decade due to illegal hunting with dogs. Although information on their status in the wild is lacking, lowland bongos are not presently considered endangered.

Bongos are susceptible to diseases such as [[rinderpest]], which almost exterminated the species the 1890s. The ''tragelaphus eurycerus'' may suffer from [[goitre]]. Over the course of the disease, the [[thyroid glands]] greatly enlarge (up to 10 x 20&amp;nbsp;cm) and may become [[polycystic]]. Pathogenesis of goiter in the bongo may reflect a mixture of genetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors, including a period of exposure to a [[goitrogen]].&lt;ref name='schiller'&gt;{{cite journal | first = C.A. | last = Schiller | coauthors = et al. | publisher = Department of Pathology, National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution | location = Washington DC, USA | journal = Veterinary Pathology | volume =  32 | pages = 242&amp;ndash;249 | title = Clinical and morphologic findings of familial goiter in bongo antelope (T.e. eurycerus) | issue =  3 | doi = 10.1177/030098589503200305 | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopard]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, [[lion]]s, and humans prey on them for their [[Fur|pelt]]s, horns and meat; [[Pythonidae|pythons]] sometimes eat bongo calves.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. E., and D. M. Reeder [editors]. 1993. Mammal Species of the World (Second Edition). Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press&lt;/ref&gt; Bongo populations have been greatly reduced by hunting, [[poaching]] and [[animal trapping]], although some bongo refuges exist.

Although bongos are quite easy for humans to catch via snares; it is of interest that many people native to the bongos habitat believed that if they ate or touched bongo they would have spasms similar to [[epileptic seizures]]. Because of this [[superstition]], bongos were less harmed in their native ranges than expected. However, these taboos are said no longer to exist and that may account for increased hunting by humans in recent times.

===Zoo programmes===
[[Image:Eastern Bongo at Edinburgh Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastern bongo at [[Edinburgh Zoo]]]] An international studbook is maintained to help manage animals held in captivity. Because of its bright colour, it is very popular in zoos and private collections. In North America, there are thought to be over 400 individuals, a population that probably exceeds that of the mountain bongo in the wild.

In 2000, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan (SSP) Participant, which works to improve the [[genetic diversity]] of managed animal populations. The target population for participating zoos and private collections in North America is 250 animals. Through the efforts of zoos in North America, a reintroduction to the population in Kenya is being developed.

===Conservation===
In the last few decades there has been a rapid decline in the numbers of wild mountain bongo due to poaching and human pressure on their habitat, with local extinctions reported in [[Cherangani Hills|Cherangani]] and [[Chepalungu]] hills, Kenya.

The Bongo Surveillance Programme, working alongside the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]], have recorded photos of bongos at remote salt licks in the Aberdare Forests using camera traps, and, by analyzing [[DNA]] extracted from [[Feces|dung]], have confirmed the presence of bongo in Mount Kenya, Eburru and [[Mau forest]]s. The programme estimate as few as 140 animals left in the wild - spread across four isolated populations. Whilst captive breeding programmes can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe and North America, the situation in the wild has been less promising. Evidence exists of bongo surviving in Kenya. However, these populations are believed to be small, fragmented and vulnerable to extinction.

Animal populations with impoverished genetic diversity are inherently less able to adapt to changes in their environment (such as climate change, disease outbreaks, habitat change, etc.). The isolation of the four remaining small bongo populations, which themselves would appear to be in decline, means that a substantial amount of genetic material is lost each generation. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater, it is for that reason that the establishment of a &quot;metapopulation management plan&quot; occurs concurrently with conservation initiatives to enhance in-situ population growth and why this initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of mountain bongo in the wild.

The western/lowland bongo faces an ongoing population decline as habitat destruction and meat hunting pressures increase with the relentless expansion of human settlement. Its long-term survival will only be assured in areas which receive active protection and management. At present, such areas comprise about 30,000&amp;nbsp;km², and several are in countries where political stability is fragile. There is therefore a realistic possibility that its status could decline to Threatened in the near future.

As the largest and most spectacular forest antelope, the western/lowland bongo is both an important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by sport hunters during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie D.S.; Carpenter J. 1999. &quot;The potential role of safari hunting as a source of revenue for protected areas in the Congo Basin&quot; Oryx 33(4): 340&amp;ndash;345&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these factors are strong incentives to provide effective protection and management of western/lowland bongo populations.&lt;ref&gt;IEA (Institute of Applied Ecology) 1998. Tragelaphus eurycerus. In African Mammals Databank - A Databank for the Conservation and Management of the African Mammals Vol 1 and 2. Bruxelles: European Commission Directorate&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Juvenile eastern bongo.jpg|thumb|A juvenile eastern bongo in Kenya.]] --&gt;

[[Image:Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci.jpg|thumb|A young mountain bongo grazes.]]One of the reasons often cited for the popularity of the bongo as a prized hunting target was a highly-publicized hunting trip taken by [[Maurice Stans]], an official in Richard Nixon's cabinet, to Uganda. During the trip, Stans killed two bongos, and after this, their desirability among wealthy hunters rose substantially.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

[[Trophy hunting]] has the potential to provide economic justification for the preservation of larger areas of bongo habitat than national parks, especially in remote regions of Central Africa where possibilities for commercially successful tourism are very limited (Wilkie and Carpenter 1999).

The eastern/mountain bongo’s survival in the wild is dependent on more effective protection of the surviving remnant populations in Kenya. If this does not occur, it will eventually become extinct in the wild. The existence of a healthy captive population of this subspecies offers the potential for its reintroduction.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources). 2002. 2002 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of eastern mountain bongos held in captivity in North America alone may already be similar to or exceed the total number remaining in the wild.{{Who|date=July 2007}}

===European zoos supporting bongo conservation in Kenya===
[[Image:Four bongo calves with nanny.jpg|thumb|left|Four bongo calves photographed here with a &quot;nanny.&quot; All will be released into the wild near Mount Kenya.]]In 2004 [[Woburn Safari Park]]s' Dr. Jake Veasey; the Head of the Department of Animal Management and Conservation at Woburn Safari Park and a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums Population Management Advisory Group, with the assistance of Lindsay Banks took over responsibility for the management and coordination of the European Endangered species Programme (EEP) for the eastern bongo. This includes some 250 animals across Europe and the Middle East.

Along with the [[Rothschild Giraffe]], the eastern bongo is arguably one of the most threatened large mammals in Africa with recent estimates numbering less than 140 animals; below a minimum sustainable viable population. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these 140 or so animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the Bongo EEP can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, the EEP has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The EEP plan to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.

[[Image:Baby Bongo 002.jpg|thumb|upright|A baby eastern bongo at [[Louisville Zoo]] in [[Kentucky]].]]To illustrate significance of genetic diversity loss; assume the average metapopulation size is 35 animals based on 140 animals spread across four populations (140/4=35). Assuming stable populations, analysis reveals that these populations will haemorrhage 8% of their genetic diversity every decade. By managing all four populations as one - through strategic transfers, gene-loss is reduced from 8% per decade to 2% per decade, without any increase in bongo numbers in [[Kenya]]. By managing the European and African populations as one - by strategic exports from Europe combined with in-situ transfers, gene-loss is reduced to 0.72% every 100 years with both populations remaining stable. If populations in Kenya are allowed to grow through the implementation of effective conservation, including strategic transfers, gene-loss can effectively be halted in this species and its future secured in the wild.

The initial aims of the project are: -

1) Through faecal DNA analysis, estimate the genetic diversity of the remaining wild bongo and calculate the relatedness of the isolated wild populations.&lt;br /&gt;
2) More accurately estimate the total population of wild bongo through faecal DNA analysis, camera trapping and transect surveying. &lt;br /&gt;
3) Through direct sampling, estimate the genetic diversity of the captive bongo population and calculate its relatedness with the remaining isolated wild populations.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Collect DNA samples from western bongo to calculate the relatedness of the two subspecies.&lt;br /&gt;
5) Funding rangers to collect the above data in Kenya, enhance the degree of protection afforded to the eastern bongo and level of understanding of its ecological needs.

To realise such a metapopulation management plan, work with local communities is essential to reverse the decline and allow for the implementation of a transfer strategy. It's likely a substantial proportion of wild genetic diversity will have already have been lost.

If effective protection were implemented immediately and bongo populations allowed to expand without transfers, then this would create a bigger population of genetically impoverished bongo. These animals would be less able to adapt to a dynamic environment. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater. For this reason it's important that the 'metapopulation management plan' occurs concurrently with conservation strategies to enhance in-situ population growth. This is why this initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of the mountain bongo in the wild.

This year at Woburn Safari Park there will be a conservation campaign to help raise money to support the Bongo Surviellance Project and the Kenyan Wildlife Service. On Friday 6 August 2010 Woburn will be holding a fundraising evening with extra activities and later opening times.

==Legal status==
In 2002 the [[IUCN]], listed the western/lowland species as [[Near Threatened]]. This may mean that bongos may be endangered due to human environmental interaction as well as hunting and illegal actions towards wildlife.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN2008| assessors =IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group| year =2008| id = 22047 | title = Tragelaphus eurycerus | downloaded = 29 march 2009}} Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is of near threatened.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CITES]] lists bongo as an Appendix III species, only regulating their exportation from a single country, Ghana. It is not protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and is not listed by [[USFWS]].

The [[IUCN]] Antelope Specialist Group considers the western or lowland bongo, ''T. eurycerus'', to be Lower Risk (Near Threatened), and the eastern or mountain bongo, ''T. e. isaaci'', of Kenya to be [[Critically Endangered]]. Other subspecific names have been used but their validity has not been tested.

The '''bunyip''' or '''kianpraty'''&lt;ref&gt;E.E.Morris(1898) ''Austral English; A Dictionary of Australasian words, Phrases and Usages''. p.65-66. McMillan and Co, New York. Reprinted Gale Research Company, Book Tower, Detroit, USA, 1968. [http://books.google.com/books?id=n9DhrpFhIzsC&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=XwuC3AWrLW&amp;dq=kianpraty&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=kianpraty&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; is a large [[Mythology|mythical]] [[animal|creature]] from [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Aboriginal mythology]], said to lurk in [[swamp]]s, [[billabong]]s, [[stream|creeks]], [[river]]beds, and [[wiktionary:waterhole|waterhole]]s.
The origin of the word bunyip has been traced to the [[Wemba-Wemba]] or Wergaia language of Aboriginal people of South-Eastern [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Joan Hughes (ed.)(1989) ''Australian Words and Their Origins.'' p.90. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. ISBN 019553087X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Butler (2009) ''The Dinkum Dictionary; The origin of Australian Words'' p.53. Text Publishing, Melbourne. ISBN 9781921351983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;Robert Holden (2001) ''Bunyips: Australia's folklore of fear.'' pps.15 National Library of Australia. ISBN 0642197327&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the bunyip appears to have formed part of traditional Aboriginal beliefs and stories throughout Australia, although its name varied according to tribal nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Wannan(1970) ''Australian Folklore'', p.101. Reprinted 1976. Lansdowne Press, Melbourne. ISBN 0-7018-0088-7&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2001 book, writer Robert Holden identified at least nine regional variations for the creature known as the bunyip, across Aboriginal Australia.&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;Robert Holden (2001)pps.2-24&lt;/ref&gt; Various written accounts of bunyips were made by Europeans in the early and mid-19th century, as settlement spread across [[Australia]].

== Meaning ==
The word bunyip is usually translated by Aboriginal Australians today as &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;evil spirit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (Kath Walker)'s story in ''Stradbroke Dreamtime.'' [http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/bunyips/html-site/abor-stories/biami.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this translation may not accurately represent the role of the bunyip in [[Aboriginal mythology]] or its possible origins before written accounts were made. Some modern sources allude to a linguistic connection between the bunyip and [[Bunjil]], &quot;a mythic 'Great Man' who made the mountains and rivers and man and all the animals.&quot;&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Gwenda Davey and Graham Seal(eds)(1993) ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Folklore'', p.55-5. Oxford University Press, Melbourne ISBN 0195530578&lt;/ref&gt; The word bunyip may not have appeared in print in English until the mid 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Geelong Advocate'' July 2, 1845 at Peter Ravenscroft’s ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1850s, bunyip had also become a &quot;synonym for imposter, pretender, humbug and the like&quot; in the broader Australian community.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; The term '''[[bunyip aristocracy]]''' was first coined in 1853 to describe Australians aspiring to be aristocrats. In the early 1990s it was famously used by Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] to describe members of the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia]] opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1732 | title = Parliamentary decorum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word bunyip can still be found in a number of Australian contexts including placenames such as the [[Bunyip River]] (which flows into Westernport Bay in southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the town of [[Bunyip, Victoria]].

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Bunyip (1935).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Bunyip'' (1935) artist unknown, from the [[National Library of Australia]] digital collections, demonstrates the variety in descriptions of the legendary creature]]
Descriptions of bunyips vary widely. George French Angus may have collected a description of a bunyip in his account of a &quot;water spirit&quot; from the Moorundi people of the [[Murray River]] before 1847, stating it is &quot;much dreaded by them… It inhabits the Murray; but…they have some difficulty describing it. Its most usual form…is said to be that of an enormous starfish&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George French Angus(1847) ''Savage Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand''. Vol 1, p.99. London. Reprinted 1969 Libraries Board of South Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Brough Smyth’s ''Aborigines of Victoria'' of 1878 devoted ten pages to the bunyip, but concluded &quot;in truth little is known among the blacks respecting its form, covering or habits; they appear to have been in such dread of it as to have been unable to take note of its characteristics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smyth cited in Robert Holden (2001) p.175&lt;/ref&gt; However, common features in many 19th century newspaper accounts include a dog-like face, dark fur, a [[horse]]-like [[tail]], [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, and [[walrus]]-like tusks or horns or a duck-like bill.&lt;ref&gt;For numerous examples see Peter Ravenscroft’s survey of nineteenth century newspaper accounts of the bunyip at ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Challicum bunyip&quot;, an outline image of a bunyip carved by Aborigines into the bank of Fiery Creek, near [[Ararat, Victoria]], was first recorded by ''The Australasian'' newspaper in 1851. According to the report, the bunyip had been speared after killing an Aboriginal man. Antiquarian Reynell Johns claimed that until the mid-1850s, Aboriginal people made a &quot;habit of visiting the place annually and retracing the outlines of the figure [of the bunyip] which is about 11 paces long and 4 paces in extreme breadth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johns cited in Robert Holden(2001) p.176. The page also reprints a drawing of the outline, which no longer exists.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over origins of the bunyip==
Non-Aboriginal Australians have made various attempts to understand and explain the origins of the bunyip as a physical entity over the past 150 years. 

Writing in 1933, Charles Fenner suggested it was likely the &quot;actual origin of the bunyip myth lies in the fact that from time to time seals have made their way up the&amp;nbsp;... Murray and Darling (Rivers)&quot;. He provided examples of seals found as far inland as [[Barmera, South Australia|Overland Corner]], [[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]], and [[Conargo, New South Wales|Conargo]], and reminded readers &quot;the smooth fur, prominent 'apricot' eyes and the bellowing cry are characteristic of the seal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Fenner (1933) ''Bunyips and Billabongs''. pps.2-6. Angus and Robertson, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggestion is that the bunyip may be a cultural memory of extinct Australian marsupials such as the ''[[Diprotodon]]'' or ''[[Palorchestes]]''. This connection was first formally made by Dr George Bennett of Australian Museum in 1871,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Holden(2001) p.90&lt;/ref&gt; but in the early 1990s palaeontologist Pat Vickers-Rich and geologist Neil Archbold also cautiously suggested that Aboriginal legends &quot;perhaps had stemmed from an acquaintance with prehistoric bones or even living prehistoric animals themselves&amp;nbsp;... When confronted with the remains of some of the now extinct Australian marsupials, Aborigines would often identify them as the bunyip.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;P.Vikers-Rich, J.M.Monaghan,R.F.Baird and T.H.Rich (eds) (1991)''Vertebrate Palaeontology of Australasia''. p.2. Pioneer Design Studio and Monash University. ISBN 0909674361. They also note that &quot;legends about the'' mihirung paringmal'' of western Victorian Aborigines …may allude to the …extinct giant birds the Dromornithidae.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another connection to the bunyip is the shy Australasian bittern (''[[Botaurus poiciloptilus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Charles Fenner(1933) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; During the breeding season the male call of this marsh dwelling bird is a &quot;low pitched boom&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ken Simpson, Nicolas Day and Peter Trusler(1999) ''[[Field Guide to the Birds of Australia (Simpson &amp; Day)|Field Guide to the Birds of Australia]]'' p.72 Viking Books, Australia. ISBN 0670 879185&lt;/ref&gt; hence it is occasionally called the &quot;bunyip bird.&quot;&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

==Early accounts collected by Settlers==
[[File:Story of the bunyip 1882.jpg|thumb|right|An 1882 illustration of an Aboriginal man telling the story of the Bunyip to two White children.]]&lt;!---&quot;White&quot; has caps because it refers to the race of the children---&gt;

During the early settlement of Australia by Europeans the notion that the bunyip was an actual unknown animal that awaited discovery became common. Early European settlers, unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of the island continent's peculiar fauna, regarded the bunyip as one more strange Australian animal and sometimes attributed unfamiliar animal calls or cries to it. It has also been suggested that 19th century bunyip-lore was reinforced by imported European memories, such as that of the Irish [[Púca]].&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

A large number of bunyip sightings occurred between 1840s and 1850s, particularly in the southeastern colonies of [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] and [[Colony of South Australia|South Australia]], as European settlers extended their reach. The following is not an exhaustive list of accounts:

===Hume find of 1818===
One of the earliest accounts relating to a large unknown freshwater animal was in 1818&lt;ref&gt;Robert Holden(2001) p.86&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Hamilton Hume]] and James Meehan found some large bones at [[Lake Bathurst]] in [[New South Wales]]. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as very much like a [[hippopotamus]] or [[manatee]]. The Philosophical Society of Australasia later offered to reimburse Hume for any costs incurred in recovering a specimen of the unknown animal, but for various reasons Hume did not return to the lake.&lt;ref&gt;See minutes cited (19 December 1821) in Peter Ravenscroft's ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wellington Caves fossils 1830===
More significant was the discovery of fossilised bones of &quot;some quadruped much larger than the ox or buffalo&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Rankin cited in Robert Holden(2001) p.86&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Wellington Caves]] in mid 1830 by bushman George Rankin and later, [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]. Sydney's Reverend [[John Dunmore Lang]] announced the find as &quot;convincing proof of the deluge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J.D.Lang cited in Robert Holden(2001) p.86&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was British anatomist [[Sir Richard Owen]] who identified the fossils as the gigantic marsupials ''[[Nototherium]]'' and ''[[Diprotodon]]''. At the same time, some settlers observed &quot;all natives throughout these... districts have a tradition (of) a very large animal having at one time existed in the large creeks and rivers and by many it is said that such animals now exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;cited in Robert Holden(2001) p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===First written use of the word bunyip in 1845===
Fossils found near [[Geelong]] were revealed by ''The Geelong Advertiser'' in July 1845, under the headline '''Wonderful Discovery of a new Animal'''. It continued &quot;On the bone being shown to an intelligent black (sic), he at once recognised it as belonging to the bunyip, which he declared he had seen. On being requested to make a drawing of it, he did so without hesitation.&quot; The account noted a story of an Aboriginal woman being killed by a bunyip, and the &quot;most direct evidence of all,&quot; which was that of a man named Mumbowran, &quot;who showed several deep wounds on his breast made by the claws of the animal.&quot; The account provided this description of the creature
{{quote|“The Bunyip, then, is represented as uniting the characteristics of a bird and of an alligator. It has a head resembling an emu, with a long bill, at the extremity of which is a transverse projection on each side, with serrated edges like the bone of the stingray. Its body and legs partake of the nature of the alligator. The hind legs are remarkably thick and strong, and the fore legs are much longer, but still of great strength. The extremities are furnished with long claws, but the blacks say its usual method of killing its prey is by hugging it to death. When in the water it swims like a frog, and when on shore it walks on its hind legs with its head erect, in which position it measures twelve or thirteen feet in height.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Geelong Advertiser'' 2 July 1845 in Peter Ravenscroft's ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shortly after this account appeared, it was repeated in other Australian newspapers. However it appears to be the first use of the word bunyip in a written publication.

In January 1846, a peculiar skull was taken from the banks of [[Murrumbidgee River]] near [[Balranald, New South Wales]]. Initial reports suggested that it was the skull of something unknown to science. The squatter who found it remarked &quot;all the natives to whom it was shown called [it ] a bunyip&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Robert Holden(2001) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1847 several experts had identified the skull as the deformed foetal skull of a foal or calf.&lt;ref&gt;W.S.Macleay and later, Professor Owen cited in Robert Holden(2001) pps.92-3&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time however, the so-called bunyip skull was put on display in the [[Australian Museum]] (Sydney) for two days. Visitors flocked to see it and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' said that it prompted many people to speak out about their 'bunyip sightings.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/bunyips/html-site/evidence/skull.html] National library of Australia.

===William Buckley's account of bunyips 1852===

Another early written account is attributed to escaped convict [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] in his 1852 biography of 30 years living with the [[Wathaurong]] people. His 1852 account records &quot;in... Lake Moodewarri [now Lake Modewarre] as well as in most of the others inland...is a...very extraordinary amphibious animal, which the natives call Bunyip.&quot; Buckley's account suggests he saw such a creature on several occasions. He adds &quot;I could never see any part, except the back, which appeared to be covered with feathers of a dusky grey colour. It seemed to be about the size of a full grown calf... I could never learn from any of the natives that they had seen either the head or tail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Flannery(Ed.)(2002): ''The Life and Adventures of William Buckley; 32 Years a wanderer amongst the Aborigines of the then unexplored country around Port Phillip, now the Province of Victoria'' by John Morgan. First published 1852. This edition, Text Publishing, Melbourne Australia. p.66. ISBN 1877008206&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley also claimed the creature was common in the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] and cites an example he heard of an Aboriginal woman being killed by one. He emphasized the Bunyip was believed to have supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Flannery(Ed.)(2002) ''The Life and Adventures of William Buckley.'' p.138-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Popular Culture and Fiction==

Numerous tales of the bunyip in written literature appeared in the 19th and early 20th century. These included a story in [[Andrew Lang]]'s ''[[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books#Brown Fairy Book (1904)|The Brown Fairy Book]]'' (1904). ''The Bunyip of Berkeley's Creek''&lt;ref&gt;''The Bunyip of Berkeley's Creek'', Jenny Wagner ISBN 0-14-050126-6&lt;/ref&gt; is a contemporary Australian children's picture book about a bunyip.

Perhaps the best known bunyip character in Australia is Alexander Bunyip, created by children's author and illustrator Michael Salmon. First appearing in print in ''The Monster That Ate Canberra''&lt;ref&gt;''The Monster That Ate Canberra'' ISBN 0-957-95504-9, Michael Salmon&lt;/ref&gt; in 1972, Alexander Bunyip went on to appear in many other books and even a live-action television series, ''Alexander Bunyip's Billabong.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487233/&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Alexander is planned for the [[Gungahlin]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent depiction of the bunyip appears in the 1989 illustrated children's book ''A Kangaroo Court.''&lt;ref&gt;''A Kangaroo Court'' ISBN 0-333-45032-9, Mary O'Toole, illustrated by Keith McEwan&lt;/ref&gt;[[Naomi Novik]] includes bunyips as a dangerous adversary in the Australian outback in [[Tongues of Serpents]], the sixth installment of her [[Temeraire (series)|novels of alternate Napoleonic-history era, with dragons]].

A bunyip had an important role in the 1930s classic novel [[Mountain of the Moon]] ([[Chander Pahar]] in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version), written by [[Bengali people|Bengali]] author [[Bibhutibhushan Banerjee]].

The word bunyip has been used in other Australian contexts including ''The Bunyip'' newspaper as the banner of a local weekly newspaper published in the town of [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]], [[South Australia]]. First published as a pamphlet by the Gawler Humbug Society in 1863, the name was chosen because, &quot;the Bunyip is the true type of Australian Humbug!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bunyippress.com.au/fixed/history.html | title = ''The Bunyip'' | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | date= 2000-06-07-06-07 | work = Home Page | publisher = ''The Bunyip'', (Gawler's Weekly Newspaper) | quote = Beneath the nineteenth-century dignity of colonial Gawler ran an undercurrent of excitement. Somewhere in the mildness of the spring afternoon an antiquated press clacked out a monotonous rhythm with a purpose never before known in the town. Then the undercurrent burst in a wave of jubilation - Gawler's first newspaper, &quot;''The Bunyip''&quot;, was on the streets.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used in numerous other Australian contexts, including the ''House of the Gentle Bunyip'', in [[Clifton Hill, Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;The 1860s house was saved from demolition by community action and redeveloped as a home for low income people.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a coin operated Bunyip at [[Murray Bridge, South Australia]] at Sturt Reserve on the town's river front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adhills.com.au/tourism/towns/murraybridge/attractions.html | title = What to See &amp; Do in Murray Bridge | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | work = Murray Bridge Tourism Information | publisher = Adelaide Hills On-Line | quote = When a coin is inserted in the machine the Bunyip raises from the depths of its cave, booming forth its loud ferocious roar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[World War II]] the bunyip has undergone some cultural crossover from Australia to the United States and beyond; as it now appears as a character in several role-playing and computer games such as; [[Garou Tribes (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)]], a boss monster in [[Chrono Cross]], and as the name of a summoned creature in the popular [[MMORPG]] game, ''[[RuneScape]]''. The bunyip is also a monster in ''[[AdventureQuest]]''. This version is a magical, heavily built creature of the night that is part jackrabbit, part wolf, and part giant.

The cultural cross over from Australia to the USA may have some connection to the use of a bunyip (bunyap) as the symbol of the U.S. Air Force's [[7th Fighter Squadron]],&lt;ref&gt;currently based at [[Holloman AFB]], New Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; which was based in Australia in 1942, shortly after its formation. 

In the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;[[Bertie the Bunyip]]&quot; was a children's show in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], created by Lee Dexter, an Australian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvparty.com/lostbertie.html ''Bertie The Bunyip''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bunyips were featured on ''[[The Secret Saturdays]]'' in the episode &quot;Into the Mouth of Darkness&quot; with their vocal effects provided by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. Here, the bunyips were depicted as small, furry, mischievous [[cryptids]] that resemble the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] of [[Looney Tunes]] with small antlers. The bunyip was also featured repeatedly on the US WB Soap &quot;[[Charmed]]&quot;, most notably the episode &quot;Nymphs Just Wanna Have Fun&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://charmed.wikia.com/wiki/Bunyip&lt;/ref&gt; and an episode of the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] show [[The Wild Thornberrys]].

In the [[novelette]] &quot;Water Babies&quot; by [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], a series of drownings investigated by an Australian police officer turn out to be the work of a predatory seal-like creature that may be the inspiration for the bunyip legends.

The novel, &quot;The Neddiad&quot; by [[Daniel Pinkwater]] features a character named Shlmomos Bunyip who is controlled by an evil earth spirit that lives in a swamp.

The poetry anthology &quot;[http://www.phoenixeduc.com/english/Antipodes/Antipodes.htm Antipodes: Poetic Responses]&quot;, edited by Margaret Bradstock, features a poem titled ''The Challicum Bunyip'', by Australian poet Benjamin Dodds. The poem presents an interpretation of the Challicum Bunyip story.&lt;ref&gt;Bradstock, M. ''Antipodes: Poetic Responses''. Phoenix Education, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boone''' is a town located in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of western [[North Carolina]], United States.  Boone's population was reported as 17,122, as of 2010.  Boone is the [[county seat]] of [[Watauga County, North Carolina|Watauga County]] and the home of [[Appalachian State University]].
The town is named for famous [[American pioneer]] and explorer [[Daniel Boone]], and every summer since 1952 has hosted an outdoor amphitheatre portrayal of the life and times of its namesake.

==Boone==

Boone took its name from the famous pioneer and explorer [[Daniel Boone]], who on several occasions camped at a site generally agreed to be within the present city limits.  Daniel's nephews, Jesse and Jonathan (sons of brother Israel Boone), were founders of the town's first church, Three Forks Baptist, still in existence today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
Boone was served by the [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad]] (nicknamed &quot;[[Tweetsie Railroad|Tweetsie]]&quot;) until the flood of 1940.  The flood washed away much of the tracks and it was decided by the powers that be not to replace them.

Boone is the home of [[Appalachian State University]], a constituent member of the [[University of North Carolina]].
Appalachian State is the fifth largest university in the seventeen-campus system.
[[Caldwell Community College &amp; Technical Institute]] also operates a satellite campus in Boone.

&quot;''[[Horn in the West]]''&quot;, a dramatization of the life and times of the early settlers of the mountain area, which features Daniel Boone as one of its characters, has been performed in an outdoor [[amphitheatre]] above the town every summer since 1952.
The original actor in the role of &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was [[Ned Austin]]. His &quot;Hollywood Star&quot; stands on a pedestal on King Street in downtown Boone.  He was followed in the role by Glenn Causey, who portrayed the rugged frontiersman for 41 years, and whose image is still seen in many of the depictions of Boone featured in the area today.

The late guitarist [[Michael Houser]] was born in Boone.
He is best known as a founding member of and lead guitarist for the band [[Widespread Panic]].
The [[Grammy|Grammy Award-winning]] guitar player [[Doc Watson]] also comes from the Boone area, as do many [[bluegrass music]]ians and [[Appalachia]]n [[storytelling|storytellers]].

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:DanBooneASU.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Daniel Boone statue on the campus of Appalachian State University]]

Boone is located at {{Coord|36|12|41|N|81|40|7|W|type:city}} (36.211364, −81.668657){{GR|1}} and has an elevation of 3,333 feet (1015.9 m) above mean sea level. An earlier survey gave the elevation as 3,332&amp;nbsp;ft and since then it has been published as having an elevation of 3,333&amp;nbsp;ft (1,016 m). Boone has the highest elevation of any town of its size (over 10,000 population) east of the [[Mississippi River]]. As such, Boone features a [[oceanic climate|subtropical highland]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''), a rarity for cities in the South. Compared to the lower elevations of the Carolinas, winters are long and cold, with frequent sleet and snowfall, with the January high at {{convert|39.3|F|1}},&lt;ref name = NOAA /&gt; being more similar to much of [[New England]] than the South. Blizzard-like conditions are not unusual during many winters. Summers are warm, but far cooler and less humid than lower regions to the south and east, with a July high of {{convert|76.4|F|1}}.&lt;ref name = NOAA /&gt; &lt;!-- Boone typically receives on average nearly 40&amp;nbsp;inches of snowfall annually, which is far higher than the lowland areas in the rest of North Carolina, which receive less than 10&amp;nbsp;inches of snowfall annually on average. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} --&gt;

==Demographics==
As of the census{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 13,472 people, 4,374 households, and 1,237 families residing in the town. The [[population density]] was 2,307.0 people per square mile (890.7/km²). There were 4,748 housing units at an average density of 813.0 per square mile (313.9/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 93.98% [[White American|White]], 3.42% [[African American|Black or African American]], 0.30% Native American, 1.19% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.05% [[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]], 0.46% from [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census#Race|other races]], and 0.60% from two or more races. 1.64% of the population were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] of any race.{{GR|2}}

There were 4,374 households out of which 9.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 21.0% were married couples living together, 5.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 71.7% were non-families. 38.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.97 and the average family size was 2.63.{{GR|2}}

The age distribution is 5.8% under 18, 65.9% from 18 to 24, 12.1% from 25 to 44, 9.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% who were 65 or older. The median age was 21 years. Both the overall age distribution and the median age are typical for communities dominated by a large university, here Appalachian State. For every 100 females there are 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.7 males.{{GR|2}}

The median household income is $20,541, and the median family income is $49,762. The [[per capita income]] is $12,256. 37.0% of the population and 9.2% of families were below the [[poverty line]].{{GR|2}}

Men had a median income of $28,060 versus $20,000 for women.  However, poverty statistics that are based on surveys of the entire population can be extremely misleading in communities dominated by students, such as Boone. Out of the total population, 6.3% of those under the age of 18 and 9.1% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.{{GR|2}}

==Law and government==

Boone operates under a [[mayor-council government]]. The city council consists of five members. The mayor presides over the council and casts a vote on issues only in the event of a tie.  As of October 2009, the City Council members are:  Loretta Clawson, Mayor;  Lynne Mason, Councilor, Mayor Pro-tempore; and Councilors: Rennie Brantz,  Andy Ball, Stephen Phillips, and  Jamie Leigh.&lt;ref name=&quot;List of government officials&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townofboone.net/mayor/mayor.php |title=Town of Boone, NC: Mayor &amp; Town Council |publisher=Townofboone.net |date= |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Industrial, commercial, and residential development in the town of Boone is a controversial issue due to its location in the mountains of Appalachia. On October 16, 2009, the town council accepted the &quot;Boone 2030 Land Use Plan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boone2030.blogspot.com/ |title=Boone2030Blogspot |publisher=TownOfBoone |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the document itself is not in any way actual law, it is used by the town council, board of adjustment, and other committees to guide decision making as to what types of development are appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawrencegroup.com/boone2030/finalDocs/BooneReportFinalBook110609.pdf |title=Boone 2030 Land Use Plan PDF |publisher=Lawrence Group |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] began widening 1.1 miles of U.S. 421 (King Street) to a four to six-lane divided highway with a raised concrete median from U.S. 321 (Hardin Street) to east of N.C. 194 (Jefferson Road), including a new entrance and exit to the new Watauga High School, at a cost of $16.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/us421widening/ |title=NC DOT US421 Widening Project |publisher=NCDOT |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widening has displaced 25 businesses and 63 residences east of historic downtown King Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wataugademocrat.com/2007/0312web/statedotpaves.php |title=statedotpaves |publisher=Wataugademocrat.com |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is slated to be completed by December 31, 2011.

The '''Banshee''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|æ|n|ʃ|iː}} {{respell|BAN|shee}}), from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''bean sí'' {{IPA|[bʲæn ˈʃiː]}} (&quot;woman of the ''[[Aos Sí#The sídhe: abodes of the aes sídhe|síde]]''&quot; or &quot;woman of the [[fairy mounds]]&quot;) is a feminine spirit in [[Irish mythology]], usually seen as an omen of death and a messenger from the [[Other World|Otherworld]]. 

The ''[[aos sí]]'' (&quot;[[tumulus]] folk&quot;) are variously believed to be the survivals of [[pre-Christian]] [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[deity|deities]], spirits of nature, or the ancestors. Sightings of Banshees have been reported as recently as 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Superstition  | journal = Western Folklore   | volume = 7  | issue = 4  | pages =   | publisher = Western States Folklore Society  | location =   | date = October 1948  | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/1497855  | issn =   | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The story of the ''bean-sidhe'' began as a fairy woman [[keening]] at the death of important personages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Az&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Knight  | first = Jan  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = A-Z of ghosts and supernatural  | publisher = Pepper Press  | year = 1980  | location =   | pages = 10  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 0 560 74509 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later stories, the appearance of the banshee could foretell death. Banshees were said to appear for particular Irish families, though which families made it onto this list varied depending on who was telling the story. Stories of Banshees were also prevalent in the West Highlands of Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Az&quot;/&gt;

The banshee can appear in a variety of guises. Most often she appears as an ugly, frightening hag, but she can also appear as a stunningly beautiful woman of any age that suits her. In some tales, the figure who first appears to be a &quot;banshee&quot; is later revealed to be the Irish battle goddess, [[the Morrígan]]. The hag may also appear as a washer-woman, or ''[[bean-nighe]]'' (washing woman), and is seen washing the blood stained clothes or armour of those who are about to die.

Although not always seen, her mourning call is heard, usually at night when someone is about to die and usually around woods. In 1437, [[King James I of Scotland]] was approached by an Irish seer or banshee who foretold his murder at the instigation of the Earl of Atholl. There are records of several prophets believed to be incarnate banshees attending the great houses of Ireland and the courts of local Irish kings. In some parts of Leinster, she is referred to as the ''bean chaointe'' (keening woman) whose wail can be so piercing that it shatters glass. In [[County Kerry|Kerry]] in the southwest of Ireland, her keen is experienced as a &quot;low, pleasant singing&quot;; in [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] in the north, as &quot;the sound of two boards being struck together&quot;; and on [[Rathlin Island]] as &quot;a thin, screeching sound somewhere between the wail of a woman and the moan of an [[owl]]&quot;.

The banshee may also appear in a variety of other forms, such as that of a [[hooded crow]], [[stoat]], [[hare]] and [[weasel]] - animals associated in Ireland with [[witchcraft]].

==History and mythology==
In Irish legend, a banshee wails nearby if someone is about to die. There are particular families who are believed to have banshees attached to them, and whose cries herald the death of a member of that family. The most common surname attached to the banshee was [[Mac (surname)|Mac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  | title = Banshee  | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | volume =   | pages = 62  | publisher = Harper Element  | year = 2006  | id =   | accessdate = January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also associated with the [[Airlie (surname)|Airlie]] clan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Az&quot;/&gt; Accounts of banshees go back as far as 1380 with the publication of the ''Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh'' (''Triumps of Torlough'') by Seean mac Craith.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot;/&gt; Mentions of banshees can also be found in [[Normans|Norman]] literature of that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot;/&gt;

Traditionally, when a person died a woman would sing a lament (in {{lang-ga|caoineadh}}, {{IPA|[ˈkɰiːnʲə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈkiːnʲuː]}}, ''&quot;caoin&quot;'' meaning &quot;to weep, to wail&quot;) at the funeral. These women are sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Keening|keeners]]&quot; and the best keeners would be in much demand. Legend has it that for five great Gaelic families — the [[O'Grady (surname)|O'Gradys]], the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]], the [[O'Brien]]s, the [[O'Connor]]s, and the [[Kavanagh (surname)|Kavanagh]]s — the lament would be sung by a fairy woman; having foresight, she would sing the lament when a family member died, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come, so that the wailing of the banshee was the first warning the household had of the death.

The [[O'Brien]]s banshee was thought to have the name of [[Eevul]], and was ruler of 25 other banshees who would always be at her attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Westropp  | first = Thos. J.   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = A Folklore Survey of County Clare  | journal = Folklore  | volume =   | issue =   | pages = 180–199  | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.   | location =   | date = June 1910  | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/1254686  | issn =   | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that from this myth comes the idea that the wailing of numerous banshees signifies the death of a great person.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot;/&gt;

In later versions, the banshee might appear before the death and warn the family by wailing.&lt;ref&gt;Visual or oral [[Hallucination]]s of the Banshee may cause death especially in a person who is very sick and close to dying by destroying that person's confidence that he/she can survive, see [[Nocebo effect]].&lt;/ref&gt; When several banshees appeared at once, it indicated the death of someone great or holy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeats&quot;&gt;Yeats, W. B. &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot; in Booss, Claire; Yeats, W.B.; Gregory, Lady (1986) ''A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend, and Folklore''. New York: Gramercy Books. p. 108. ISBN 978-0-517-48904-8&lt;/ref&gt; The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a woman who died in childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1976), pp.14-16: &quot;Banshee&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banshees are frequently described as dressed in white or grey, often having long, pale hair which they brush with a silver comb, a detail scholar Patricia Lysaght attributes to confusion with local [[mermaid]] [[Mythology|myths]]. This comb detail is also related to the centuries-old traditional romantic Irish story that, if you ever see a comb lying on the ground in Ireland, you must never pick it up, or the banshees (or mermaids&amp;nbsp;— stories vary), having placed it there to lure unsuspecting humans, will spirit such gullible humans away. Other stories portray banshees as dressed in green, red, or black with a grey cloak.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

==American Folklore==
Stories of banshees can also be found in America in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; The most prevalent of the American stories comes from [[Tar River]] in Edgecomb County, North Carolina. However, in this variation of the story, the banshee is simply a ghoul, as opposed to a sign of misfortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

==Celtic cultures==
In Welsh folklore, a similar creature is known as the [[Hag of the mist]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Elias (1996). ''Welsh folk-lore: A collection of the folk-tales and legends of North Wales''. Felinfach: Llanerch. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transgenic maize''' ([[maize|corn]]) has been deliberately [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] (GM) to have agronomically desirable traits. Traits that have been engineered into corn include resistance to [[herbicide]]s and resistance to [[insect]] pests, the latter being achieved by incorporation of a [[gene]] that codes for the ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) toxin. [[Hybrid seed|Hybrid]]s with both herbicide and pest resistance have also been produced. In 2009, transgenic maize was grown commercially in 11 countries, including the [[United States]] (where 85% of the maize crop was genetically modified), Brazil (36% GM), Argentina (83% GM), [[South Africa]] (57% GM), Canada (84% GM), the Philippines (19% GM) and Spain (20% GM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/341.genetically_modified_maize_global_area_under_cultivation.html Genetically modified plants: Global Cultivation Area Maize] GMO Compass, March 29, 2010, retrieved August 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herbicide resistant corn==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Corn varieties resistant to [[glyphosate]] herbicides (Liberty and [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]) have been produced. There are also corn hybrids with tolerance to [[imidazoline]] herbicides marketed by [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]], under the [[trademark]] &quot;Clearfield&quot; but in these, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred without the use of [[genetic engineering]]. Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval, use, trade and consumption of transgenic crops does not apply for imidazoline-tolerant corn.{{Nonspecific|date=November 2010}}

Herbicide-resistant GM corn is grown in the United States. A variation of herbicide-resistant GM corn was approved for import into the [[European Union]] in 2004, but such imports remain highly controversial.

==Bt corn==
[[Image:Corn borer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The [[European corn borer]], ''Ostrinia nubilalis'', destroys corn crops by burrowing into the stem, causing the plant to fall over.]]
Bt corn is a variant of [[maize]], [[Genetically modified organism|genetically altered]] to express the bacterial [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] toxin, which is [[poison]]ous to [[insect]] pests. In the case of corn, the pest is the [[European corn borer]].

Expressing the toxin was achieved by inserting a [[gene]] from the [[microorganism]] ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' into the corn [[genome]]. This gene [[code for|codes for]] a [[toxin]] that causes the formation of pores in the Lepidoptera larval digestive tract. These pores allow naturally occurring enteric bacteria, such as ''E. coli'' and ''Enterobacter'', to enter the [[hemocoel]], where they multiply and cause [[sepsis]]. (Broderick and others., PNAS 2006) This is contrary to the common misconception that Bt toxin kills the larvae by starvation.

In 2001, Bt176 varieties were voluntarily withdrawn from the list of approved varieties by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) when it was found to have little or no Bt expression in the ears and was not found to be effective against second generation corn borers.

===Effects of Bt corn on nontarget insects===
In May 1999, a laboratory at [[Cornell University]] published the results from a laboratory trial that appeared to indicate the [[pollen]] of genetically modified Bt corn presented a threat to [[Monarch butterfly|monarch]] caterpillars. Critics claimed the popular media were wrong to report monarch butterflies were threatened because this experiment did not duplicate natural conditions under which monarch caterpillars may come in contact with corn pollen. (Cornell News, 1999)

In 2001, the scientific journal the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] published six comprehensive studies that showed Bt corn pollen does not pose a risk to monarch populations for the following reasons:
*The density of Bt corn pollen that overlays milkweed leaves in the environment rarely comes close to the levels needed to harm monarch butterflies. Both laboratory and field studies confirmed this.
*There is limited overlap between the period Bt corn sheds pollen and when caterpillars are present.
*Only a portion of the monarch caterpillar population feeds on milkweeds in and near cornfields.
(Sears, ''et al.'', 2001)

Monarch populations in the USA during 1999 increased by 30%, despite Bt corn accounting for 30% of all corn grown in the USA that year. The beneficial effects of Bt corn on Monarch populations can be attributed to reduced pesticide use. (Trewavas and Leaver, 2001).

Numerous scientific studies continue to investigate the potential effects of Bt corn on a variety of nontarget [[invertebrate]]s. A synthesis of data from many such field studies (Marvier ''et al.'' 2007) found the measured effect depends on the standard of comparison. The overall abundance of nontarget invertebrates in Cry1Ab variety Bt corn fields is significantly higher compared to non-GM corn fields treated with [[insecticide]]s, but significantly lower compared to insecticide-free non-GM corn fields. Abundance in fields of another variety, Cry3Bb corn, is not significantly different compared to non-GM corn fields either with or without insecticides.

===Preventing Bt resistance in pests===
By law, farmers in the United States who plant Bt corn must plant non-Bt corn nearby. These unmodified fields are to provide a location to harbor [[Maize#Pests|pests]]. The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of the pests' resistance to the Bt pesticide. Doing so enables an area of the landscape where [[wild type]] pests will not be immediately killed.

It is anticipated resistance to Bt will evolve in the form of a [[recessive allele]] in the pest. Because of this, a pest that gains resistance will have an incredibly higher [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] than the wild type pest in the Bt corn fields. If the resistant pest is feeding in the non-Bt corn nearby, the resistance is [[neutral (biology)|neutral]] and offers no advantage to the pest over any nonresistant pest. Ensuring there are at least some breeding pests nearby that are not resistant increases the chance the resistant pests will choose to mate with nonresistant ones. Since the gene is recessive, all [[offspring]] will be [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]], and the offspring from that mating will not be resistant to Bt and therefore no longer a threat. Using this method, scientists and farmers hope to keep the number of resistant genes very low, and use [[genetic drift]] to ensure any resistance that does emerge does not spread.

Although mandated by law, compliance data from the EPA for 2008 showed, however, 25% of Bt corn growers were not in compliance. The data showed noncompliance climbed to {{convert|13.23|e6acre|km2}}, or almost 15% of all Bt corn grown, suggesting in some areas ample acreage does not exist to support pests without resistance to mate with any resistant pests that survived the Bt corn.&lt;ref&gt;Cspinet.org
http://cspinet.org/new/pdf/complacencyonthefarm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European corn borer]], one of the primary insects Bt is meant to target, has been shown to be capable of developing resistance to the Bt protein.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/cropsystems/dc7055.html#ch11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross pollination===
The non-Bt pesticide status of the refuges is being compromised by wind-borne [[pollen]] drifting into the non-Bt corn fields. Corn harvested from the supposed Bt-free zones has shown traces of Bt toxin. The levels found in the non-Bt corn decreases with distance from the Bt-corn fields, indicating the pollen is wind-borne rather than another method of transfer. The concentrations in the refuge fields were found to be low-to-moderate.

Possible solutions to the [[Pollination#Pollinators and pollenizers|cross pollination]] problem are to plant a wider refuge field or plant varieties of corn that bloom at different times than the Bt fields do. (Chilcutt &amp; Tabashnik, 2004) [citation needed]

===Sweet corn for human consumption===
&quot;Attribute&quot; is the brand name for a line of Bt sweet corn. Seed is available only to large professional farmers who sign a stewardship agreement. The farmer must agree to not repackage or resell Attribute seed. Growers also must grow the corn exactly as directed. Herbicide-resistant sweet corn has not yet been released for sale.

===Safety issues===
A 2009 study compared an analysis of blood and organ system data from trials with rats fed three main commercialized genetically modified types of maize which are present in food and feed in the world. Approximately 60 different biochemical parameters were classified per organ and measured in serum and urine after 5 and 14 weeks of feeding. GM maize-fed rats were compared first to their respective isogenic or parental non-GM equivalent control groups, followed by comparison to six reference groups, which had consumed various other non-GM maize varieties. According to the authors, &quot;Our analysis clearly reveals for the 3 GMOs new side effects linked with GM maize consumption, which were sex- and often dose-dependent. Effects were mostly associated with the kidney and liver, the dietary detoxifying organs, although different between the 3 GMOs. Other effects were also noticed in the heart, adrenal glands, spleen and haematopoietic system. We conclude that these data highlight signs of hepatorenal toxicity, possibly due to the new pesticides specific to each GM corn. In addition, unintended direct or indirect metabolic consequences of the genetic modification cannot be excluded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biolsci.org http://www.biolsci.org/v05p0706.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee reviewed the 2009 Vendômois ''et al.'' study and concluded that it &quot;..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/acnfp9612a2&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Food Standards Australia New Zealand of the 2009 Vendômois ''et al.'' study concluded that the results were due to chance alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/scienceandeducation/factsheets/factsheets2009/fsanzresponsetoseral4647.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

===StarLink corn controversy===
StarLink is a variety of Bt corn patented by [[Aventis Crop Sciences]] (a subdivision of [[Aventis]], acquired by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] in 2002), intended for use in [[compound feed|animal feed]].

U.S. regulatory authorities permitted the commercial sale of StarLink seed with the stipulation that crops produced must not be used for human consumption. This restriction was based on the possibility that a small number of people might develop an [[allergy|allergic]] reaction to the Bt protein used in StarLink that is less rapidly digested than the version used in other Bt varieties.

StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans. An episode involving [[Taco Bell]] [[taco]] shells was particularly well publicized.&lt;ref&gt;King D, Gordon A. Contaminant found in Taco Bell taco shells. Food safety coalition demands recall (press release), vol 2001. Washington, DC: Friends of the Earth, 2000. Available: http://www.foe.org/act/getacobellpr.html. 3 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a public relations disaster for Aventis and the biotechnology industry as a whole. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued. The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Agricultural Biotechnology: Updated Benefit Estimates, Janet E. Carpenter and Leonard P. Gianessi 2001, National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

28 people reported apparent allergic reactions related to eating corn products that may have contained the Starlink protein. However, the US Centers for Disease Control studied the blood of these individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.&lt;ref&gt;CDC, National Center for Environmental Health. Investigation of Human Health Effects Associated with Potential Exposure to Genetically Modified Corn: A Report to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta,GA:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent review of these tests by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel points out that while &quot;the negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined ... in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this&quot; &lt;ref&gt;FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel Report No. 2001-09, July 2001 http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/SAP/meetings/2001/july/julyfinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Aid sent by the UN and the US to Central African nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved refused to accept the aid.

The southern portion of the U.S. [[corn belt]] planted the greatest amount of StarLink corn. It is this portion of the U.S. where corn borer damage creates the greatest economic loss to farmers.

The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001. No positive samples have been found since 2004, showing that, most probably, it was possible to withdraw this GM crop without leaving traces in the environment once it has been used in the field &lt;ref&gt;North American Millers' Association (press release), Apr. 28, 2008,http://www.namamillers.org/PR_StarLink_04_28_08.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virus-resistant corn==
In 2007, researchers from South Africa announced the production of transgenic maize resistant to [[maize streak disease]] (MSD), caused by [[maize streak virus]] (MSV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shepherd DN, Mangwende T, Martin DP, ''et al.'' |title=Maize streak virus-resistant transgenic maize: a first for Africa |journal=Plant Biotechnol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Body substance isolation''' is a practice of isolating all body substances ([[blood]], [[urine]], [[feces]], [[tears]], etc.) of individuals undergoing medical treatment, particularly emergency medical treatment of those who might be infected with illnesses such as [[HIV]], or [[hepatitis]] so as to reduce as much as possible the chances of transmitting these illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch P, Jackson MM, Cummings MJ, Stamm WE. Rethinking the role of isolation practices in the prevention of nosocomial infections. Ann Intern Med 1987;107(2):243-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  BSI is similar in nature to [[universal precautions]], but goes further in isolating workers from [[pathogens]], including substances now known to carry HIV.

==Place of body substance isolation practice in history==
Practice of Universal precautions was introduced in 1985–88.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. Update: universal precautions for prevention of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and other bloodborne pathogens in health-care settings. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1988;37(24):377-82, 87-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CDC. Recommendations for preventing transmission of infection with human T- lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus in the workplace. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1985;34(450:681-6, 91-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the practice of Universal precautions was adjusted by a set of rules known as body substance isolation. In 1996, both practices were replaced by the latest approach known as standard precautions (health care). Nowadays and in isolation, practice of body substance isolation has just historical significance.

Body substance isolation went further than [[universal precautions]] in isolating workers from [[pathogens]], including substances now currently known to carry [[HIV]]. These pathogens fall into two broad categories, bloodborne (carried in the body fluids) and airborne. The practice of BSI was common in Pre-Hospital care and [[Emergency Medical Services]] due to the often unknown nature of the patient and his/her disease or medical conditions. It was a part of the National Standards Curriculum for Prehospital Providers and Firefighters.

Types of body substance isolation included:
* [[Hospital gown]]s
* [[Medical gloves]]
* [[Shoe covers]]
* [[Surgical mask]] or [[Respirator|N95 Respirator]]
* [[Glasses|Safety Glasses]]

It was postulated that BSI precautions should be practiced in environment where treaters were exposed to bodily fluids, such as:
* [[blood]], [[semen]], [[preseminal fluid]], [[vaginal secretion]]s, [[synovial fluid]], [[amniotic fluid]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[pleural fluid]], [[peritoneal fluid]], [[marrow]], [[pericardial fluid]], [[feces]], [[nasal secretion]]s, [[urine]], [[vomitus]], [[sputum]], [[mucus]], [[cervical mucus]], [[phlegm]], [[saliva]], [[breastmilk]], [[colostrum]], and secretions and blood from the [[umbilical cord]]&lt;ref&gt;Lynch P, Jackson MM, Cummings MJ, Stamm WE. Rethinking the role of isolation practices in the prevention of nosocomial infections. Ann Intern Med 1987;107(2):243-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such infection control techniques that were recommended following the [[AIDS]] outbreak in the 1980s. Every patient was treated as if infected and therefore precautions were taken to minimize risk. Other conditions which called for minimizing risks with BSI:

* Diseases with air-borne transmission (e.g., [[tuberculosis]])
* Diseases with droplet transmission (e.g., [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[influenza]], [[pertussis]])
* Transmission by direct or indirect contact with dried skin (e.g., colonisation with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) or contaminated surfaces
* [[Prion]] diseases (e.g., [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]])
or any combination of the above.

[[File:Queen Boudica by John Opie.jpg|right|thumb|''Boadicea Haranguing the Britons'' by [[John Opie]]]]
'''Boudica''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|uː|d|ɨ|k|ə}}; alternative spelling: '''Boudicca'''), also known as '''Boadicea''' {{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|d|ɨ|ˈ|s|iː|ə}} and known in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as &quot;Buddug&quot; {{IPA-cy|ˈbɨ̞ðɨ̞ɡ|}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Davies|first =John|authorlink =John Davies (historian)|title = A History of Wales|publisher = Penguin|year = 1993|location = London|pages = 28| isbn = 0-14-01-4581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (d. AD 60 or 61) was queen of the [[Iceni]] tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the [[Roman Empire]].

Boudica's husband [[Prasutagus]], ruler of the [[Iceni]] tribe who had ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome, left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman Emperor in his will. However, when he died, his will was ignored. The kingdom was annexed as if conquered, Boudica was [[flogged]] and her daughters [[Rape|raped]], and Roman financiers called in their loans.

In AD 60 or 61, while the Roman governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign on the island of [[Anglesey]] in north [[Wales]], Boudica led the Iceni people, along with the [[Trinovantes]] and others, in revolt. They destroyed [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), formerly the capital of the Trinovantes, but now a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' (a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers) and the site of a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]], which was built and maintained at local expense.  They also routed a Roman legion, the [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], sent to relieve the settlement.

On hearing the news of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to [[Londinium]] (London), the twenty-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target. Concluding he did not have the numbers to defend it, Suetonius evacuated and abandoned it. It was burnt to the ground, as was [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]). An estimated 70,000&amp;ndash;80,000 people were killed in the three cities (though the figures are suspect).&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann''. 14.33&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the Britons in the [[Battle of Watling Street]]. The crisis caused the emperor [[Nero]] to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from the island, but Suetonius' eventual victory over Boudica secured Roman control of the province. Boudica then killed herself so she would not be captured, or fell ill and died; Tacitus and Dio differ.

The history of these events, as recorded by [[Tacitus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#14|14-16]]; ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.29 14:29-39]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cassius Dio]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62* .html#1 62:1-12]&lt;/ref&gt; was rediscovered during the [[Renaissance]] and led to a resurgence of Boudica's legendary fame during the [[Victorian era]], when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was portrayed as her '[[namesake]]'. Boudica has since remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom. The absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that Britain owes its knowledge of Boudica's rebellion solely to the writings of the Romans.

==History==
===Boudica's name===
Boudica has been known by several versions of her name. [[Raphael Holinshed]] calls her Voadicia, while [[Edmund Spenser]] calls her &quot;Bunduca&quot;, a version of the name that was used in the popular Jacobean play ''[[Bonduca]]'', in 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonduca&quot;&gt;[[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], ''[http://www.bibliomania.com/0/6/1/1975/frameset.html Bonduca]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Cowper]]'s poem, ''Boadicea, an ode'' (1782) popularised an alternate version of the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boadicea, an ode&quot;&gt;[[William Cowper]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/41/320.html Boadicea, an ode]''&lt;/ref&gt; From the 19th century and much of the late 20th century, &quot;Boadicea&quot; was the most common version of the name, which is probably derived from a mistranscription when a manuscript of [[Tacitus]] was copied in the [[Middle Ages]]. Her name was clearly spelled ''Boudicca'' in the best manuscripts of Tacitus, but also ''Βουδουικα'', ''Βουνδουικα'', and ''Βοδουικα'' in the (later and probably secondary) epitome of Cassius Dio. ''Boudica'' is a commonly repeated spelling based upon Jackson's hypothesis that it was originally a [[Proto-Celtic]] feminine adjective ''*boudīka'', &quot;victorious&quot;, derived from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''*bouda'', &quot;victory&quot; (cf. [[Irish language|Irish]] ''bua'' (Classical Irish ''buadh''), ''Buaidheach'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''buddugoliaeth''). It is suggested that the most comparable English name would be &quot;Victoria&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys, Sir John. 1908. General Literature Committee: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (Great Britain). ''Early Britain, Celtic Britain''. p. 284. [http://books.google.com/books?id=VLpCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Boudica&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AAteTIuGMcG78gaQp-i9DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Boudica&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is attested in inscriptions as &quot;Boudica&quot; in [[Lusitania]], &quot;Boudiga&quot; in [[Bordeaux]], and &quot;Bodicca&quot; in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Webster, ''Boudica: The British Revolt against Rome AD 60'', 1978; [[Guy de la Bédoyère]], [http://www.romanbritain.freeserve.co.uk/Legions.htm ''The Roman Army in Britain''], retrieved 5 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Based on later development of Welsh and Irish, [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] concludes that the correct spelling of the name in the [[British language (Celtic)|British language]] is ''Boudica'', pronounced {{IPA-cel|bɒʊˈdiːkaː|}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]], &quot;Queen Boudica?&quot;, ''Britannia'' 10, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; (the closest English equivalent to the vowel in the first syllable is the ''ow'' in &quot;bow-and-arrow&quot;). The modern English pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|d|ɪ|k|ə}}.&lt;ref&gt;Boudicca. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Boudicca (accessed: December 20, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Background===
[[File:Map of the Territory of the Iceni.svg|thumb|right|150px|Location of Iceni territory within England; modern county borders for England and Wales are shown for context.]]
Tacitus and Dio agree that Boudica was of [[Royal family|royal]] descent. Dio says that she was &quot;possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women&quot;, that she was tall, had hair described as reddish-brown or tawny hanging below her waist, a harsh voice and a piercing glare, and habitually wore a large golden necklace (perhaps a [[torc]]), a many-coloured tunic, and a thick cloak fastened by a [[brooch]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''xanthotrichos'' translated in this passage as red-brown or tawny can also mean auburn, or a shade ''short'' of brown, but most translators now agree a colour inbetween light and browny red - '''tawny''' -''Boudica and her stories: narrative transformations of a warrior queen'', Carolyn D. Williams, University of Delaware Press, 2009, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, [[Prasutagus]], was the king of [[Iceni]], people who inhabited roughly what is now [[Norfolk]]. They initially were not part of the territory under direct Roman control, having voluntarily allied themselves to Rome following [[Claudius]]' [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] of AD 43. They were jealous of their independence and had revolted in AD 47 when the then-[[Roman governors of Britain|governor]] [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]] threatened to disarm them.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31-32]&lt;/ref&gt; Prasutagus lived a long life of conspicuous wealth, and, hoping to preserve his line, made the [[Roman emperor]] co-heir to his kingdom along with his wife and two daughters.
It was normal Roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their [[client king]], who would agree to leave his kingdom to Rome in his will: the provinces of [[Bithynia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[H. H. Scullard]], ''From the Gracchi to Nero'', 1982, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galatia]],&lt;ref&gt;John Morris, ''Londinium: London in the Roman Empire'', 1982, pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; for example, were incorporated into the Empire in just this way. [[Roman law]] also allowed [[inheritance]] only through the male line. So when Prasutagus died, his attempts to preserve his line were ignored and his kingdom was annexed as if it had been conquered. Lands and property were confiscated and nobles treated like slaves. According to [[Tacitus]], Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped. Dio Cassius says that Roman financiers, including [[Seneca the Younger]], chose this time to call in their loans. Tacitus does not mention this, but does single out the [[Promagistrate|procurator]], [[Catus Decianus]], for criticism for his &quot;avarice&quot;. Prasutagus, it seems, had lived well on borrowed Roman money, and on his death his subjects had become liable for the debt.

===Boudica's uprising===
In AD 60 or 61, while the current governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign against the island of Mona (modern [[Anglesey]]) in north Wales, which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the [[druid]]s, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudica was chosen as their leader. According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of [[Arminius]], the prince of the [[Cherusci]] who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven [[Julius Caesar]] from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#15|15]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of [[divination]], releasing a [[hare]] from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran, and invoked [[Andraste]], a British [[goddess]] of [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]].  Perhaps it is significant that Boudica's own name means &quot;victory&quot; (see [[#Boudica's name|above]]).

The rebels' first target was [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]), the former Trinovantian capital and at that time a Roman ''[[Colonia (Roman)| colonia]]''. The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals, and a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]] had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. The Roman inhabitants of the city sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]]. Boudica's army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have shown that the city was methodically demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,406152,00.html &quot;Dig uncovers Boudicca's brutal streak&quot;], ''[[The Observer]]'', 3 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The future governor [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]], then commanding the [[Legio IX Hispana|Legio IX ''Hispana'']], attempted to relieve the city, but suffered an [[Massacre of the Ninth Legion|overwhelming defeat]]. His infantry was wiped out; only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped. The location of this famous battle is claimed by the village of [[Great wratting|Great Wratting]], in Suffolk, which lies in the Stour Valley on the Icknield Way West of Colchester, and by a village in Essex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Haverhill From the Iron Age to 1899|url=http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/hh-to-1899.cfm|publisher=St. Edmundsbury Borough Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this defeat, Catus Decianus fled to [[Gaul]].

When news of the rebellion reached him, Suetonius hurried along [[Watling Street]] through hostile territory to [[History of London#Roman London|Londinium]] (London). Londinium was a relatively new town, founded after the conquest of 43AD, but it had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of travellers, traders, and probably, Roman officials. Suetonius considered giving battle there, but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petillius's defeat, decided to sacrifice the city to save the province. Londinium was abandoned to the rebels, who burnt it down, slaughtering anyone who had not evacuated with Suetonius. Archaeology shows a thick red layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before 60 AD within the bounds of the Roman city.&lt;ref&gt;George Patrick Welch, ''Britannia: The Roman Conquest &amp; Occupation of Britain'', 1963, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]) was next to be destroyed.

In the three cities destroyed, between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed. Tacitus says the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners, only in slaughter by [[gibbet]], fire, or cross. Dio's account gives more detail: that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths, &quot;to the accompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and wanton behaviour&quot; in sacred places, particularly the groves of Andraste.

{{See also|Battle of Watling Street}}
Suetonius regrouped with the [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV ''Gemina'']], some ''vexillationes'' (detachments) of the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], and any available auxiliaries. The [[prefect]] of [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']], [[Poenius Postumus]], ignored the call, but nonetheless the governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men. He took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] somewhere along the [[Roman road]] now known as [[Watling Street]], in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] with a wood behind him. But his men were heavily outnumbered. Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line: by now the rebel forces numbered 230,000. However, this number should be treated with scepticism: Dio's account is known only from a late [[epitome]], and ancient sources commonly exaggerate enemy numbers. While Boudica's army continued their assault in [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans|St. Albans]]), Suetonius regrouped his forces. According to Tacitus, he amassed a force including his own [[Legio XIV Gemina|Legio XIV ''Gemina'']], parts of the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], and any available auxiliaries, a total of 10,000 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;TacAnn14.34&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.34 14.34]&lt;/ref&gt; A third legion, [[Legio II Augusta|II ''Augusta'']], near [[Exeter]], failed to join him;&lt;ref name=&quot;TacAnn14.37&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.37 14.37]&lt;/ref&gt; a fourth, [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], had been routed trying to relieve Camulodunum.&lt;ref name=&quot;TacAnn14.32&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.32 14.32]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudica exhorted her troops from her [[chariot]], her daughters beside her. Tacitus gives her a short speech in which she presents herself not as an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body, and the abused chastity of her daughters. Their cause was just, and the deities were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed. She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice.

However, the lack of manoeuvrability of the British forces, combined with lack of open-field tactics to command these numbers, put them at a disadvantage to the Romans, who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline, and the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans could at a given time.

First, the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of ''[[pilum|pila]]'' (heavy javelins) to kill thousands of [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] who were rushing toward the Roman lines. The Roman soldiers, who had now used up their ''pila'', were then able to engage Boudica's second wave in the open. As the Romans advanced in a [[Flying wedge|wedge]] formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered. This is not the first instance of this tactic. The women of the [[Cimbri]], in the [[Battle of Vercellae]] against [[Gaius Marius]], were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence;&lt;ref&gt;[[Florus]], ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 1#38|1.38]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariovistus]] of the [[Suebi]] is reported to have done the same thing in his battle against [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book1#51|1.51]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus reports that &quot;according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell&quot; compared with only four hundred Romans. According to Tacitus, Boudica poisoned herself; Dio says she fell sick and died, and was given a lavish burial.

Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. [[Catus Decianus]], who had fled to Gaul, was replaced by [[Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus]]. Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by [[Nero]]'s [[freedman]] [[Polyclitus (freedman)|Polyclitus]]. Fearing Suetonius' actions would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced the governor with the more conciliatory [[Publius Petronius Turpilianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#39|XIV.39]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian [[Suetonius|Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus]] tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero* .html#18 18], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#39 39-40]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of her defeat===
The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown. Most historians favour a site in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], somewhere along the Roman road now known as [[Watling Street]]. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to [[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]] in [[Leicestershire]], on the junction of Watling Street and the [[Fosse Way]], which would have allowed the [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']], based at [[Exeter]], to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces, had they not failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin K. Carroll, &quot;The Date of Boudicca's Revolt&quot;, ''Britannia'' 10, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manduessedum]] ([[Mancetter]]), near the modern town of [[Atherstone]] in [[Warwickshire]], has also been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: A History of Roman Britain'', 1987, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; as has 'The Rampart' near [[Messing]] in [[Essex]], according to legend.&lt;ref&gt;Messing-cum-Inworth Community Website: [http://messing-cum-inworth-pc.gov.uk/messVill.htm Messing Village]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a discovery of Roman artifacts in [[Kings Norton]] close to [[Birmingham military history|Metchley Camp]] has suggested another possibility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/5016126.stm Is Boudicca buried in Birmingham?], BBC, 25 May 2006, retrieved 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and a thorough examination of a stretch of Watling Street between St. Albans, Boudica's last known location, and the Fosse Way junction has suggested the Cuttle Mill area of [[Paulerspury]] in Northamptonshire, which has topography very closely matching that described by Tacitus of the scene of the battle.&lt;ref&gt; Battlefield Britain (BBC). &quot;The Rebellion of Boudicca&quot; (2004), Paulerspury website [http://paulerspury.org/content/view/18/49/] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical sources===
Tacitus, the most important Roman historian of this period, took a particular interest in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] as [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], his father-in-law and the subject of his first book, served there three times. Agricola was a military [[tribune]] under Suetonius Paulinus, which almost certainly gave Tacitus an eyewitness source for Boudica's revolt. Cassius Dio's account is only known from an [[epitome]], and his sources are uncertain. He is generally agreed to have based his account on that of Tacitus, but he simplifies the sequence of events and adds details, such as the calling in of loans, that Tacitus does not mention.

[[Gildas]], in his 6th century ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', may have been alluding to Boudica when he wrote ''&quot;A treacherous lioness butchered the governors who had been left to give fuller voice and strength to the endeavours of Roman rule.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Hingley, Richard; Christina Unwin, ''Boudica: Iron Age Warrior Queen'' # Hambledon Continuum; New Ed edition (15 June 2006) ISBN 978-1852855161 p.61 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rc6_Jq7Xll4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Boudicca+Gildas+lioness&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Boudicca%20Gildas%20lioness&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
===History and literature===
By the [[Middle Ages]] Boudica was forgotten. She makes no appearance in [[Bede]]'s work, the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' or [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]''. But the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus during the [[Renaissance]] allowed [[Polydore Virgil]] to reintroduce her into British history as &quot;Voadicea&quot; in 1534.&lt;ref&gt;''Polydore Vergil's English History'' Book 2 ([http://books.google.co.uk/books?vid=OCLC04693319&amp;id=hSAIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA59&amp;lpg=RA2-PA59&amp;dq=cassivellaunus&amp;as_brr=1#PRA2-PA69,M1 pp. 69-72]).&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael Holinshed also included her story in his ''Chronicles'' (1577), based on Tacitus and Dio,&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphael Holinshed]], ''Chronicles'': History of England [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16536/16536-h/16536-h.htm#page494 4.9-13]&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] younger contemporaries [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] to write a play, ''[[Bonduca]]'', in 1610.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonduca&quot;/&gt; [[William Cowper]] wrote a popular poem, ''Boadicea, an ode'', in 1782.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boadicea, an ode&quot;/&gt;

It was in the [[Victorian era]] that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was seen to be Boudica's &quot;namesake&quot;. Victoria's [[Poet Laureate]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], wrote a poem, ''Boadicea'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], ''[http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/8721-Alfred-Lord-Tennyson-Boadicea Boadicea]''&lt;/ref&gt; and several ships were named [[HMS Boadicea|after her]]. A great bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with [[scythed chariot|scythes]] after the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] fashion) was commissioned by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and executed by [[Thomas Thornycroft]]. It was completed in 1905 and stands next to [[Westminster Bridge]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], with the following lines from Cowper's poem, referring to the British Empire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Regions Caesar never knew
Thy posterity shall sway.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ironically, the great anti-imperialist rebel was now identified with the head of the [[British Empire]], and her statue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%2526+heritage/war+%2526+conflict/pre%252d20th+century+conflict/tra22669 |title=Battlefield Britain - Boudicca's revolt against the Romans |author=Corinne Field |date=30 April 2006 |publisher=Culture24 |accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; stood guard over the city she razed to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Webster, ''Boudica: The British Revolt against Rome AD 60'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, Boudica has been the subject of numerous documentaries, including some by [[Discovery Channel]], [[History International|History International Channel]], and the [[BBC]].

===Fiction===
Boudica has been the subject of two feature films, the 1928 film ''[[Boadicea (film)|Boadicea]]'', where she was portrayed by [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018713/ ''Boadicea'' (1928)]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2003's ''[[Boudica (film)|Boudica]]'' (''Warrior Queen'' in the USA), a UK [[television|TV]] film written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] and starring [[Alex Kingston]] as Boudica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338806/ ''Boudica'' (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also been the subject of a 1978 British TV series, ''[[Warrior Queen]]'', starring [[Siân Phillips]] as Boudica. [[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]] portrayed Boudica in an episode of ''[[Xena - Warrior Princess]]'' entitled &quot;The Deliverer&quot; in 1997.

[[The Viking Queen]] is a 1967 Hammer Films adventure film set in ancient Britain, in which the role of Queen Salina is based up on the historical figure of Boudica.

Boudica's story is the subject of several novels, including books by [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], [[Pauline Gedge]], [[Manda Scott]], [[Alan Gold (author)|Alan Gold]], [[Diana L. Paxson]], [[David Wishart]], [[George Shipway]], [[Simon Scarrow]] and J. F. Broxholme (a pseudonym of [[Duncan Kyle]]). She plays a central role in the first part of [[G. A. Henty]]'s novel ''[[Beric the Briton, A Story of the Roman Invasion|Beric the Briton]].'' One of the viewpoint characters of [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]]'s novel ''Oracle'' is an eyewitness to her defeat. She has also appeared in several comic book series, including the ''[[Sláine (comics)|Sláine]]'', which featured two runs, entitled &quot;Demon Killer&quot; and &quot;Queen of Witches&quot; giving a free interpretation of Boudica's story.  Other comic appearances include ''[[Witchblade]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]''.   Boudicca is a character in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dracandros.com/Jebgarg/tge/boudicca.htm''Boudicca''] at The Gargoyles Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], Boudicca is the subject of a play written by [[William Shakespeare]] to incite the people of Britain to revolt against Spanish conquerors.

[[Henry Purcell]]'s last major work, composed in 1695, was music for play entitled ''Bonduca, or the British Heroine'' (Z. 574).  Selections include &quot;To Arms&quot;, &quot;Britons, Strike Home&quot; and &quot;O lead me to some peaceful gloom&quot;.  Boudica has also been the primary subject of songs by Irish singer/songwriter [[Enya]], Dutch soprano [[Petra Berger]], Scottish singer/songwriter [[Steve McDonald]], English metal band [[Bal-Sagoth]], [[Faith and the Muse]] and [[Dreams in the Witching House]]. She has also been mentioned in [[The Libertines]]' song The Good Old Days.

===Other cultural references===
{{In popular culture|date=August 2009}}
There have been scattered reports that the restless spirit of Boudica has been seen in the county of [[Lincolnshire]]. These reports, dating back to the mid-19th century, claim Boudica rides her chariot, heading for some unknown destination, and many a traveller and motorist have claimed to have seen her.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Asfar, ''Haunted Highways:  Ghost Stories and Strange Tales'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a long-lived urban myth that she is buried under Platform 10 of [[King's Cross railway station]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6497 Queen Boadicea ( - 61) - Find A Grave Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This originates from the village of Battle Bridge (previously on the station's site), which was said to be the site of her last battle, suicide and burial.  This is now accepted as a fiction and a hoax, whose origins can be traced back to Lewis Spence's book ''Boadicea &amp;mdash; Warrior Queen of the Britons'' (1937) (where it is given but unevidenced&lt;!---page number needed---&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Bob Trubshaw, [http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/edge/boudica6.htm &quot;Boudica - the case for Atherstone and Kings Cross&quot;] from ''[http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/edge/index.htm At the Edge]''&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.channel4.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/8896096411/m/5550051141 &quot;A Boudicca question&quot;], discussion on the  [http://community.channel4.com/eve/forums/a/frm/f/8896096411 Time Team forum] at [http://www.channel4.com/index.html?hpos=logo Channel 4]&lt;/ref&gt; It is now thought that Battle Bridge was a corruption of 'Broad Ford Bridge'. Other such legends place her burial on Parliament Hill, Hampstead or in Suffolk.

In 2003, an LTR [[retrotransposon]] from the [[genome]] of the human [[Schistosoma|blood fluke]] ''Schistosoma mansoni'' was named ''Boudicca''.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland CS, Brindley PJ, Heyers O, Michael SF, Johnston DA, Williams DL, Ivens AC, Kalinna BH, &quot;''Boudica'', a retrovirus-like long terminal repeat retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke ''Schistosoma mansoni''&quot;.

In July 2008, the UK Television series ''[[Bonekickers]]'', dedicated an hour to Boudica in the episode named &quot;The Eternal Fire&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

On her 1987 [[Enya (album)|debut album]], the Irish singer [[Enya]] performed the song &quot;Boadicea&quot;.

Various female politicians, including former [[Prime Minister]] of New Zealand, [[Helen Clark]] have been called Boadicea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10540015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Róisín Murphy]] is featured in a song titled &quot;Boadicea&quot; from [[Mason (DJ)]]'s 2010 debut album.

Boadicea is mentioned several times in the novel Clockwork Angel by Cassandra Clare.

'''Borneo''' ({{lang-ms|Borneo}}, {{lang-id|Kalimantan}}) is the [[List of islands by area|third largest island in the world]] and is located north of Australia, at the geographic centre of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].

The island is divided among three countries: [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. The Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in the north occupy about 26% of the island. The sovereign state of [[Brunei]], located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo's land area. It has the oldest rainforest in the world ahead of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Brazil]].{{cn|date=May 2011}}

==Geography==
[[Image:Mount kinabalu 01.png|thumb|left|[[Mount Kinabalu]]]]
{{nowrap|Borneo is surrounded}} by the [[South China Sea]] to the north and northwest, the [[Sulu Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Celebes Sea]] and the [[Makassar Strait]] to the east, and the [[Java Sea]] and [[Karimata Strait]] to the south. It is the largest island in the [[Malay archipelago]], with an area of {{convert|743330|km2|sqmi}}. To the west of Borneo are the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Sumatra]]. To the south is [[Java (island)|Java]]. To the east is [[Sulawesi]], and to the northeast, the [[Philippines]].

Borneo's highest point is [[Mount Kinabalu]] in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]], with an elevation of {{convert|4095|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]] it is the third highest peak in [[South East Asia]], making Borneo the world's [[List of islands by highest point|third highest island]].

The largest river system is the [[Kapuas River|Kapuas]] in [[West Kalimantan]]. With a length of {{convert|1143|km|abbr=on}}, it is the longest river in Indonesia. Malaysia's longest river, the [[Rajang River|Rajang]], lies in Sarawak and is {{convert|562.5|km|abbr=on}} long. Other major rivers include the [[Barito River|Barito]] in [[South Kalimantan]] ({{convert|880|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}) and the [[Mahakam River|Mahakam]] in [[East Kalimantan]] ({{convert|980|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}).

Borneo has significant cave systems. Clearwater Cave, for example, has one of the world's longest underground rivers. [[Deer Cave]] is home to over three million [[bat]]s, with [[guano]] accumulated to over {{convert|100|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;BBC-TV: Planet Earth&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to ancient Chinese, Indian and Javanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports, part of their trade routes, since the first millennium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soon2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Trade in Lakawood Products Between South China and the Malay World from the Twelfth to Fifteenth Centuries AD|author=Derek Heng Thiam Soon|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=32|issue=2|pages=133–149|month=June|year=2001|doi=10.1017/S0022463401000066|accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese manuscripts, [[gold]], [[camphor]], [[tortoise]] shells, [[hornbill ivory]], [[rhinoceros]] horn, [[Crane (bird)|crane crest]], [[beeswax]], lakawood (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick [[liana]], ''Dalbergia parviflora''), [[dragon's blood]], [[rattan]], edible [[bird's nest]]s and various spices were among the most valuable items from Borneo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broek1962&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Place Names in 16th and 17th Century Borneo|author=Jan O. M. Broek|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=16|year=1962|pages=129–148|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1150309|accessdate=2008-10-28|doi=10.1080/03085696208592208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[demographics of India|Indians]] named Borneo as ''Suvarnabhumi'' (the land of gold) and also ''Karpuradvipa'' (Camphor Island). The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] named Borneo as ''Puradvipa'', or Diamond Island. [[archaeology|Archaeological]] findings in the delta river of [[Sarawak]] reveal that the area was once a thriving trading centre between India and China from the 500's until about 1300 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broek1962&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Dayaks in their war dress.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dayak people|Dayaks]], the natives of Borneo in their traditional war dress. [[Headhunting]] was an important part of Dayak culture.]]
One of the earliest evidence of Hindu influence in [[Southeast Asia]] were stone pillars which bears inscriptions in the [[Pallava script]] found in [[Kutai]] along the [[Mahakam River]] in [[East Kalimantan]] dated around the second half of the 300's AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|work=The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|publisher=E Press, The Australian National University|title=(Chapter 15) The Earliest Indic State: Kutai|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/austronesians/austronesians/mobile_devices/ch15s02.html|year=2006|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, almost all coastal parts of Borneo were under the control of [[Majapahit|Majapahit kingdom]] as is written in the Javanese [[Nagarakretagama]] document ([[circa|ca.]] 1365) and it was called ''Nusa Tanjungnagara''. The name of a trading port city in Borneo is ''Tanjungpura'' in the Nagarakretagama; the same name written in another Javanese [[Pararaton]] document ([[circa|ca.]] 1355).&lt;ref name=&quot;Broek1962&quot;/&gt;

In the 15th century, the [[Majapahit]] rule exerted its influence in Borneo. Princess Junjung Buih, the queen of the Hindu kingdom of Negara Dipa (situated in Candi Agung area of Amuntai) married a Javanese prince, Prince Suryanata, and together they ruled the kingdom which is a tributary to the Majapahit Empire (1365). In this way, it became a part of [[Nusantara]]. Along the way, the power of Negara Dipa weakened and was replaced by the new court of Negara Daha. When Prince Samudra (Prince Suriansyah) of Negara Daha converted to Islam and formed the Islamic kingdom of Banjar, it inherited some of the areas previously ruled by the Hindu kingdom of Negara Daha.

The Sultanate of [[Brunei]], during its golden age from the 15th century to the 17th century, ruled a large part of northern Borneo. In 1703 (other sources say 1658), the [[Sulu Sultanate|Sultanate of Sulu]] received North Borneo from the Sultan of Brunei, after Sulu sent aid against a rebellion in Brunei. During the 1450s, Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr, an Arab born in Johor, arrived in Sulu from Malacca. In 1457, he founded the Sultanate of Sulu; he then renamed himself &quot;Paduka Maulana Mahasari Sharif Sultan Hashem Abu Bakr&quot;. Subsequently HM Sultan Jamalul Ahlam Kiram (1863–1881), the 29th reigning Sultan of Sulu, leased North Borneo in 1878 to Gustavus Baron de Overbeck and Alfred Dent, representing the [[British North Borneo Company]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sabah.org.my/bi/know_sabah/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt; in what is now the Malaysian state of [[Sabah]]. The company also exerted control on inland territories that were inhabited by numerous tribes. In the 19th century, coastal areas ruled by the Sultanate in the west of the island were gradually taken by the dynasty of [[James Brooke]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sarawak.gov.my/content/view/3/7/&lt;/ref&gt; The Brooke dynasty ruled [[Sarawak]] for a hundred years and became famous as the &quot;[[White Rajahs]]&quot;.

By the 18th century, the area from [[Sambas]] to [[Berau]] were tributaries to the Banjar Kingdom, but this eventually shrunk to the size of what is now [[South Kalimantan]] as a result of agreements with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. In the Karang Intan Agreement during the reign of Prince Nata Dilaga (Susuhunan Nata Alam) (1808–1825), the Banjar Kingdom gave up its territories to the Dutch Indies which included [[Sultanate of Bulungan|Bulungan]], [[Kutai]], Pasir, Pagatan and Kotawaringin. Other territories given up to the Dutch Indies were Landak, Sambas, Sintang and Sukadana.

[[Image:Borneo logging 1926.jpg|thumb|right|A large log being placed on a railroad car at Batottan, British North Borneo in 1926]]

In the early 19th century, [[United Kingdom|British]] and Dutch governments signed the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] to exchange trading ports under their controls and assert spheres of influences, in which indirectly set apart the two parts of Borneo into British and Dutch controlled areas. [[China]] has had historical trading links with the inhabitants of the island. Some of the Chinese beads and wares found their way deep into the interior of Borneo. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Iban people|Sea Dayak]] pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/Wanderings-Among-South-Sea-Savages-And-in3.html|title=Wanderings Among South Sea Savages And in Borneo and the Philippines by H. Wilfrid Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 [[James Brooke]] and his Malays attacked the Sea-Dayaks and wiped out 800 of the 4,000 pirates.

Moreover in the 19th century, the Dutch admitted the founding of district kingdoms with native leaders who were under the power of the Dutch (''Indirect Bestuur'').
The Dutch assign a resident to head their rule over Kalimantan. List of the residents and governors of Kalimantan:
# C.A. Kroesen (1898), resident
# C.J. Van Kempen (1924), resident
# J. De Haan (1924–1929), resident
# R. Koppenel (1929–1931), resident
# W.G. Morggeustrom (1933–1937), resident
# Dr. A. Haga (1938–1942), governor
# Pangeran Musa Ardi Kesuma (1942–1945), Ridzie
# Ir. Pangeran Muhammad Noor (1945), governor

After 1938, Dutch-Borneo (Kalimantan) was one administrative territory under a governor (Governor Haga) whose seat was in [[Banjarmasin]]. In 1957, following the independence of Indonesia, Kalimantan was divided into three provinces: South Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan. In 1958, the province of Central Kalimantan separated from South Kalimantan as its own territory.

During [[World War II]], Japanese forces gained control of Borneo (1941–45). They decimated many local populations and killed Malay intellectuals. Sultan [[Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II]] of [[Sambas]] in [[Kalimantan]] was executed in 1944. The Sultanate was thereafter suspended and replaced by a Japanese council.&lt;ref&gt;http://pariwisata.kalbar.go.id/index.php?op=deskripsi&amp;u1=1&amp;u2=1&amp;idkt=4&lt;/ref&gt; During the Japanese occupation, the Dayaks played a role in guerilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division, where [[headhunting]] was temporarily revived towards the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/09/opinion/edheiman.php 'Guests' can succeed where occupiers fail]&quot;. The New York Times. November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Allied [[Z Special Unit]] provided assistance to them. After the fall of Singapore, several thousand British and Australian prisoners of war were sent to camps in Borneo. At one of the very worst sites, around [[Sandakan]] in Borneo, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ktCv32ysz0AC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Japanese prisoners of war]''&quot;. Philip Towle, Margaret Kosuge, Yōichi Kibata (2000). [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]. pp.47-48. ISBN 1852851929&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 the island [[Borneo campaign (1945)|was liberated from the Japanese]].

The [[North Borneo Federation]], also known as ''Kalimantan Utara'' or ''North Kalimantan'' was a proposed political entity which would have comprised the British Colonies of [[Sarawak]], British North Borneo ([[Sabah]]) and the protectorate of Brunei. The proposed federation was originally proposed by A. M. Azahari and was particularly favoured by the Brunei People's Party, which he led. This was seen as an alternative to joining the Federation of Malaysia, which was seen as an unnatural and unfavorable union by some. Before the Brunei People’s Party electoral success, a military wing had emerged, the ''North Kalimantan National Army'' (Malay abbreviation TNKU, ''Tentera Nasional Kalimantan Utara''), which saw itself as an anti-colonialist liberation party. After the [[Brunei Revolt]], the idea was put to rest. Currently, there still remain groups of people who favor the creation of such an independent state and desire separation from the rest of Malaysia{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

Borneo was the main site of the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]] between [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] between 1962 and about 1969, as well as the [[communism|communist]] revolts to gain control of the whole area. Before the formation of Malaysian Federation, the [[Philippines]] claimed that the Malaysian state of [[Sabah]] in [[north Borneo]] is within their territorial rights based on historical facts of the Sultanate of Sulu's leasing agreement with the North Borneo Company, is presently an unresolved claim against Malaysia. Several other territorial claims such as [[Sipadan]] were resolved at [[The Hague]] [[international court]]s.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Nepenthes villosa.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nepenthes villosa]]'', a species of [[pitcher plant]] endemic to [[Kinabalu National Park]], Borneo.]] The Borneo rainforest is 130 million years old, making it the oldest rainforest in the world and 70 million years older than the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Borneo is very rich in [[biodiversity]] compared to many other areas (MacKinnon et al. 1998). There are about 15,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are [[dipterocarp]]s), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo (MacKinnon et al. 1998). It is also the centre of evolution and radiation of many endemic species of plants and animals. Subject to [[Deforestation in Borneo|mass deforestation]], the remaining Borneo [[rainforest]] is one of the only remaining [[Habitat (ecology)|natural habitat]] for the endangered [[Bornean Orangutan]]. It is also an important refuge for many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] forest species, as the [[Asian Elephant]], the [[Sumatran Rhinoceros]], the [[Bornean Clouded Leopard]], and the [[Dayak Fruit Bat]].
It is one of the most biodiverse places on earth. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] has stated that 361 animal and plant species have been discovered in Borneo since 1996, underscoring its unparalleled biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/06/28/chameleon.snake.ap/index.html }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18 month period from July 2005 until December 2006, another 52 new species were found.

[[File:Borneo fires and smoke, 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Satellite image of the island of Borneo on August 19, 2002, showing smoke from burning peat swamp forests.]]
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] divides the island into seven distinct [[ecoregion]]s. The [[Borneo lowland rain forests]] cover most of the island, with an area of {{convert|427500|km2}}. Other lowland ecoregions are the [[Borneo peat swamp forests]], the ''[[Kerangas]]'' or Sundaland heath forests, the [[Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests]], and the [[Sunda Shelf mangroves]]. The [[Borneo montane rain forests|Borneo mountain rain forests]] lie in the central highlands of the island, above the {{convert|1000|m}} elevation. The highest elevations of [[Mount Kinabalu]] are home to the Kinabalu mountain [[alpine meadow]], an alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.

The island historically had extensive [[rainforest]] cover, but the area shrank rapidly due to heavy [[logging]] for the needs of the Malaysian plywood industry. Two [http://www.forest.sabah.gov.my/ forestry] researchers of [http://www.forest.sabah.gov.my/frc/English/index.html Sepilok Research Centre], Sandakan, Sabah in the early '80s identified four fast-growing hardwoods and a breakthrough on seed collection and handling of [[Acacia mangium]] and [[Gmelina arborea]], a fast growing tropical trees were planted on huge tract of formerly logged and deforested areas primarily in the northern part of Borneo Island. Half of the annual global [[tropical timber]] acquisition comes from Borneo. Furthermore, [[Palm oil]] plantations are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest. The rainforest was also greatly destroyed from the forest fires of 1997 to 1998, which were started by the locals to clear the forests for crops and perpetuated by an exceptionally dry [[El Niño]] season during that period. During the great fire, hotspots could be seen on [[Satellite imagery|satellite images]] and the [[haze]] thus created affected the surrounding countries of [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Singapore]]. In February 2008, the Malaysian government announced the [[Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy]] plan&lt;ref name= score&gt;{{Cite web|publisher= RECODA |title= SCORE Plan|accessdate= 2008-12-14 |year= 2008 |url= http://www.sarawakcore.com.my/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to harvest the virgin hinterlands of Northern Borneo. Further [[Deforestation in Borneo|deforestation]] and destruction of the biodiversity are anticipated in the wake of logging commissions, hydroelectric dams and other mining of minerals and resources.

In order to combat overpopulation in [[Java (island)|Java]], the Indonesian government started a massive transmigration ([[transmigrasi]]) of poor farmers and landless peasants into Borneo in the 70s and 80s, to farm the logged areas, albeit with little success as the fertility of the land has been removed with the trees and what soil remains is washed away in tropical downpours.

==Demographics==
Borneo has 15,721,384 inhabitants (January 2005), a population density of 16 inhabitants per square km. Most of the population lives in coastal cities, although the hinterland is occupied at most in small towns and villages along the rivers. The population mainly consists of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Dayak people|Dayak]] ethnic groups. The [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], who make up 29% of the population of [[Sarawak]] and 17% of total population in [[West Kalimantan]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.gdfao.gov.cn/english/relationship/fcp/200610130127.htm Province of West Kalimantan, Indonesia]&quot;. Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office.&lt;/ref&gt; originally migrated from southeastern China.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/648273/ The world's successful diasporas]&quot;. ''Management Today.'' April 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population in Kalimantan is either [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Muslim]] or practice [[animism]]. Approximately 15% of the Dayak are [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]], a religion introduced by missionaries in the 19th Century. In [[Central Kalimantan]] there is also a small [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] minority. In the interior of Borneo are also the [[Penan]], some of who still practice a nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] existence. In some coastal areas of marginal settlements are also found [[Bajau]], who were historically associated with a sea-oriented, boat-dwelling, nomadic existence. In the northwest of Borneo, the Dayak ethnic group is represented by the [[Iban people|Iban]] with about 710,000 members.

There are over 30 Dayak sub-[[ethnic group]]s living in Borneo, making the population of this island one of the most varied of human [[Group (sociology)|social groups]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Some sub-ethnicities are now represented by only 30-100 individuals and are threatened with extinction. Ancestral knowledge of [[ethnobotany]] and [[ethnozoology]] is useful in drug discovery (for example, [[bintangor]] plant for [[AIDS]]) or as future alternative food sources (such as [[sago]] starch for [[lactic acid]] production and sago maggots as a protein source). Certain indigenous Dayak people (such as the [[Kayan]], [[Kenyah]], [[Punan|Punan Bah]] and [[Penan]]) living on the island have been struggling for decades for their right to preserve their environment from loggers and transmigrant settlers and colonists.

Kalimantan was the focus for an intense [[transmigration program]] that financed the relocation of poor landless families from Java, Madura, and Bali. In 2001, transmigrants made up 21% of the population in [[Central Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=June 28, 2004|accessdate=2008-08-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints:, Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, [[Sampit conflict|violent conflict]] has occurred between some transmigrant and indigenous populations; in Kalimantan, thousands were killed in fighting between [[Madurese transmigrant]]s and the indigenous Dayak people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Beheading: A Dayak ritual|date=February 23, 2001|accessdate=2008-08-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1186401.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ballpoint pen''' is a  [[writing]] instrument with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber is filled with a [[viscosity|viscous]] ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The sphere, usually from 0.5[[mm]] to 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, may be made of [[brass]], [[steel]], [[tungsten carbide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = How does a ballpoint pen work? | work=Engineering | publisher=HowStuffWorks  | date=  1998–2007 | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question683.htm | accessdate = 16 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or any durable, hard (nondeformable) material.

==History==
[[Image:Bolígrafo birome II edit.jpg|thumb|left|130px|An authentic &quot;birome&quot;, made in Argentina by Bíró &amp; Meyne]]

The manufacture of economical, reliable ball point pens arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and the precision manufacturing capabilities of 20th century technology. Many patents worldwide are testaments to failed attempts at making these pens commercially viable and widely available. The ballpoint pen went through several failures in design throughout its early stages.

The first [[patent]] on a ballpoint pen&lt;ref&gt;Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) &quot;Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20&quot; ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69&amp;ndash;100, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; was issued on 30 October 1888, to John Loud,&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent No. 15630, 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a leather tanner, who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write on his leather products, which then-common [[fountain pen]]s could not do. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter writing and was not commercially exploited.

In the period between 1904 and 1946, particularly alternatives or improvements to the fountain pen were invented. [[Slavoljub Eduard Penkala]] invented a solid-ink fountain pen in 1907, a German inventor named Baum took out a ballpoint patent in 1910, and yet another ballpoint pen device was patented by Van Vechten Riesburg in 1916. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen. The ink clung to the ball, which spun as the pen was drawn across the paper. These proto-ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly. If the ball socket was too tight, the ink did not reach the paper. If it were too loose, ink flowed past the tip, leaking or making smears. Many inventors tried to fix these problems, but without commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Webshark Ltd. - www.webshark.hu |url=http://www.herend.com/herald/012/eng/eletmod.htm |title=A porcelán-arany csoda |publisher=Herend |date= |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[László Bíró]], a Hungarian newspaper editor, was frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted in filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, and the sharp tip of his fountain pen often tore the paper. Bíró had noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink. Since, when tried, this viscous ink would not flow into a regular fountain pen nib, Bíró, with the help of his brother George, a chemist, began to work on designing new types of pens. Bíró fitted this pen with a tiny [[ball]] in its tip that was free to turn in a socket. As the pen moved along the paper, the ball rotated, picking up ink from the ink cartridge and leaving it on the paper.  Bíró filed a British patent on 15 June 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''The first complete specifications appear to be UK 498997, June 1938 and UK 512218, December 1938; his rather basic Hungarian patent 120037 was dated April 1938.'' Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) &quot;Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20&quot; ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69&amp;ndash;100, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier pens leaked or clogged because of incorrect viscosity of the ink, and depended on gravity to deliver the ink to the ball.  Depending on gravity caused difficulties with the flow and required that the pen be held nearly vertically.  The original Biro pen used [[capillary action]] and a piston that pressurised the ink column, solving the ink delivery flow problems. Later Biro pens had a spring that kept pressure on the piston, and still later the Biro pens used just gravity and capillary action.&lt;ref&gt;Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) &quot;Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20&quot; ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69&amp;ndash;100, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 the Bíró brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Nazi Germany and moved to Argentina. On 10 June they filed another patent and formed ''Bíró Pens of Argentina''. The pen was sold in Argentina under the '''Birome''' brand ([[portmanteau]] of '''Bíró''' and '''Me'''yne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country. László was known in Argentina as Ladislao José Bíró. This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ball point pens for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircrew as the ''Biro''; they found they worked much better than fountain pens at high altitude, the latter being prone to ink-leakage in the decreased [[atmospheric pressure]].

''Eversharp'', a maker of [[mechanical pencil]]s, teamed up with [[Eberhard Faber]] in May 1945 to license the design for sales in the United States. At about the same time a U.S. businessman, [[Milton Reynolds]], saw a Biro pen in a store in [[Buenos Aires]]. He purchased several samples and returned to the U.S. to found the ''[[Milton Reynolds#The Reynolds International Pen Company|Reynolds International Pen Company]]'', producing the Biro design without license as the ''Reynolds Rocket''. He managed to beat Eversharp to market in late 1945; the first ballpoint pens went on sale at [[Gimbels]] department store in New York City on 29 October 1945 for US$9.75 each. This pen was widely known as ''the rocket'' in the U.S. into the late 1950s.

==Description==
[[Image:Macro Biro writing2.jpg|right|thumb|Ballpoint pen rolling over a paper surface, leaving behind a trail of ink.]]
There are two basic types of ball point pens: disposable and refillable.

'''Disposable pens''' are chiefly made of plastic throughout and discarded when the ink is consumed; '''refillable''' pens are metal and some plastic and tend to be much higher in price. The refill replaces the entire internal ink reservoir and ball point unit rather than actually refilling it with ink, as it takes special high-speed centrifugation to properly fill a ball point reservoir with the viscous ink. The simplest types of ball point pens have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, while others have a mechanism for retracting the tip. This mechanism is usually controlled by a button at the top and powered by a [[spring (device)|spring]] within the pen body, but other possibilities include a pair of buttons, a [[screw (simple machine)|screw]], or a slide.

[[Image:Ballpointpentip lessnoise.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tip of a ballpoint pen highly magnified]]
[[Rollerball pen]]s combine the ballpoint design with the use of liquid ink and flow systems from fountain pens;

[[Space Pen]]s, developed by Fisher in the United States, combine a more than normally viscous ballpoint pen ink with a gas-pressured piston which forces the ink toward the point. This design allows the pen to write even upside down or in zero gravity environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacepen.com/Public/Home/index.cfm Space Pen, Bullet Pen, Personalized Pens from Fisher Pen]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[graphite]] [[pencil]] can also be used in this way but produces graphite dust, requires sharpening, and is erasable, making it undesirable or unsuitable for use in some situations.

==In everyday life==
Ballpoint pens are ubiquitous in modern culture. While other forms of pen are available, ballpoint pens are certainly the most common and almost every [[household]] is likely to have several. The fact that they are cheaply available and convenient to use means they are often to be found on desks and also in pockets, handbags, purses, bags and in [[automobile|cars]] — almost anywhere where one could conceivably need to use a pen. Ballpoint pens are often provided free by businesses as a form of advertising — printed with a company's name, a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities may also include ballpoint pens in [[direct mail]] mailings in order to increase a customer's interest in the mailing.

Some people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tattoo.infmom.net/health-issues/the-case-of-the-ballpoint-tattoo/] discusses using ballpoint pens to create temporary tattoos, and also the danger of using them to create permanent ones&lt;/ref&gt; also create art on themselves with the pens; this is sometimes known as a [[Temporary tattoos|ballpoint tattoo]]. Because of this and of the widespread use of ballpoints by schoolchildren, all ballpoint ink formulas are non-[[toxic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acminet.org/Safety.htm |title=Safety |publisher=Acminet.org |date= |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manufacturing and content of the ink is regulated in most countries.

==As art medium==
[[Image:Ballpen Drawing(2).jpg|thumb|right|Ballpoint pen drawing]]

In recent years, the ballpoint pen has become a popular medium for both professional and amateur artists. The instrument offers immediacy of results with little or no preparation required, along with portability and relative low price. Point size and ink characteristics such as lightfastness and opacity are considerations in choosing a make and model of pen.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Pentel RSVP pens.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pentel]] R.S.V.P. ballpoint pens.]]

Compared to [[rollerball pen|rollerball]] and [[fountain pen|fountain]] pens, ballpoints require more pressure to write.  Ballpoints lack the free flowing supply of ink that other types have, requiring the writer to apply more pressure to the page. As a result, the ballpoint pens are less likely to leak. Their robustness makes them suitable where a firm press is required, namely for [[carbon copy]]-type forms where a layer of carbon paper transfers the writing, but not the ink, to subsequent copies.  In such use other types of pens may over time get damaged beyond usability.

They have difficulty writing on surfaces with low [[adhesion|adherence]] (such as plastics, shiny surfaces, and wet or oily surfaces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Russell |first=Melissa |url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/pen4.htm |title=How Ballpoint Pens Work |publisher=Home.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most ballpoint pens cannot be used to write upside down. However, certain [[Space Pen|special pens]] have been invented that do indeed work upside-down.

These disorders range from [[bipolar I disorder]], featuring full-blown [[manic]] episodes, to [[cyclothymia]], featuring less prominent [[hypomanic]] episodes, to &quot;subsyndromal&quot; conditions where only some of the criteria for mania or hypomania are met. These disorders typically also involve [[depressive]] symptoms or episodes that alternate with the elevated mood states, or with [[mixed episodes]] that feature symptoms of both.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of the bipolar [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] is similar to that of [[Emil Kraepelin]]'s original concept of manic depressive illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/441617 Across the Bipolar Spectrum: From Practice to Research]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Manic depressive illness is usually referred to as [[bipolar disorder]] or bipolar.

==Referential nomenclature==
A simple nomenclature system was introduced in 1978 by Angst, J., et al., to classify more easily individuals' affectedness within the spectrum, following a clinical study by the [[Psychiatric University Clinic of Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Angst | first1 = J | last2 = Felder | first2 = W | last3 = Frey | first3 = R | last4 = Stassen | first4 = HH | title = The course of affective disorders. I. Change of diagnosis of monopolar, unipolar, and bipolar illness. | journal = Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten | volume = 226 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1978 | pmid = 708227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Points on the spectrum using this nomenclature are denoted using the following codes:
* ''M''—severe [[mania]]
* ''D''—[[severe depression]] (unipolar depression)
* ''m''—less severe mania ([[hypomania]])
* ''d''—less severe depression

Thus, ''mD'' represents a case with hypomania and major depression.  A further distinction is sometimes made in the ordering of the letters, to represent the order of the episodes, where the patient's normal state is [[Euthymia (medicine)|euthymic]], interrupted by episodes of mania followed by depression (''MD'') or vice versa (''DM'').

Employing this schema, major depression would be denoted ''D''. Unipolar mania (''M'') is, depending on the authority cited, either very rare,&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro00/web3/Wachterman.html Why No &quot;Unipolar Mania&quot; Listing in DSM-IV? | Serendip's Exchange&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or nonexistent with such cases actually being ''Md''.

Unipolar hypomania (''m'') without accompanying depression has been noted in the medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Mood episodes and mood disorders: patterns of incidence and conversion in the first three decades of life, Katja  Beesdo et al.,Bipolar Disorders Volume 11 Issue 6, Pages 637 - 64 http://www3.interscience.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/journal/122542146/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation as to whether this condition may occur with greater frequency in the general, untreated population; successful social function of these potentially high-achieving individuals may lead to being labeled as normal, rather than as individuals suffering any substantial dysregulation.

[[File:1947logo.jpg|right]]
The '''Burroughs Corporation''' was a major [[United States|American]] manufacturer of [[Office supplies|business equipment]]. The company was founded in 1886 as the ''American [[Arithmometer]] Company'' and was assimilated in the 1986 [[merger]] that resulted in the creation of [[Unisys]]. The company's history paralleled many of the major developments in [[history of computing|computing]]. At its start it produced mechanical [[adding machine]]s, and later moved into programmable ledgers and then computers. And while it was one of the largest producers of [[mainframe computer]]s in the world, Burroughs also produced related equipment as well, including [[typewriter]]s and [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s.

==Early history==
[[File:Burrough's Adding Machines, 1914.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;1914 advertisement]]
[[File:BurroughsCorporationAddingMachine.jpg||thumb|upright|An early Burroughs [[adding machine]] ]]
In 1886 the American Arithmometer Company was established in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to produce and sell an [[adding machine]] invented by [[William Seward Burroughs I|William Seward Burroughs]] (grandfather of [[Beat Generation]] author [[William S. Burroughs]]). In 1904, six years after Burroughs' death, the company moved to [[Detroit]] and changed its name to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. It soon was the biggest adding machine company in America.

==Evolving product lines==
Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the ''Sensimatic'', which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain [[general ledger|ledgers]]. It could store 9, 18 or 27 [[Trial balance|balances]] during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the ''Sensitronic'' which could store balances on a [[magnetic stripe]] which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, the E2000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which was computer system supporting [[magnetic tape]], card reader/punches and a [[line printer]].

In time, Burroughs was selling more than adding machines, including typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953; the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burrough's purchase, in June 1956, of the ElectroData Corporation in [[Pasadena, California]], a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments and had a cooperative relationship with [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in Pasadena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer&quot;&gt;Sawyer, T.J., [http://tjsawyer.com/B205Home.htm &quot;Burroughs 205 HomePage&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; ElectroData had built the Datatron 205 and was working on the Datatron 220.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer&quot;/&gt; The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the D2000, D4000 range was produced (also known as the TC500—Terminal Computer 500) which had a [[golf ball printer]] and a 1K (80 bit) disk [[Memory (computers)|memory]]. These were popular as branch [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, which sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.

==A force in the computing industry==
Burroughs was one of the eight major United States [[computer]] companies (with [[IBM]], the largest, [[Honeywell]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[General Electric]], [[RCA]] and [[UNIVAC]]) through most of the 1960s. Yet in terms of sales, Burroughs was always a distant second to [[International Business Machines|IBM]]. In fact, IBM's share of the market at the time was so much larger than all of the others, that this group was often referred to as &quot;IBM and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

At the same time, Burroughs was very much a competitor. Like IBM, Burroughs tried to supply a complete line of products for its customers, including Burroughs-designed printers, [[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, computer printing [[paper]], and even [[typewriter ribbon]]s.

In the 1950s, Burroughs had worked with the Federal Reserve Bank on the development and computer processing of [[Magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) especially for the processing of bank cheques. Burroughs made special MICR/OCR sorter/readers which attached to their medium systems line of computers ([[Burroughs B2000|2700/3700/4700]]) and this entrenched the company in the computer side of the banking industry.

===Developments and innovations===
The Burroughs Corporation developed three highly innovative [[computer architecture|architectures]], based on the design philosophy of &quot;language directed design&quot;. Their machine instruction sets favored one or many [[high level programming languages]], such as [[ALGOL]], [[COBOL]] or [[FORTRAN]]. All three architectures were considered &quot;main-frame&quot; class machines:

* The [[Burroughs large systems]] machines starting with the B5000 in 1961, the B5500 was to follow a few years later; followed by the 6500/6700 in the later 1960s the B7700 in the mid 1970s, and the A series in the 1980s. The architecture of these machines were similar: [[stack machine]]s designed to be programmed in an extended [[Algol 60]]. Their [[operating system]]s, called MCP ([[MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)|Master Control Program]]&amp;mdash;the name later borrowed by the screenwriters for ''[[Tron (film)|Tron]]''), were programmed in [[ESPOL]] (Executive Systems Programming Oriented Language, a minor extension of Algol) almost a decade before [[Unix]], and the command interface developed into a compiled [[Structured programming|structured language]] with procedures called WFL ([[Work Flow Language]]).

Many [[computer scientist]]s consider these series of computers to be technologically groundbreaking. Stack oriented processors, with 48 bit word length where each word was defined as data or program contributed significantly to a secure operating environment, long before [[spyware]] and [[virus]]es affected computing. And the modularity of these large systems was also unique: multiple [[CPU]]s, multiple memory modules and multiple [[I/O]] and Data Comm processors permitted incremental and [[cost effective]] growth of system performance and reliability. In industries like banking, where continuous operations was mandatory, Burroughs large systems penetrated most every large bank, including the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. And Burroughs built the backbone [[switching systems]] for SWIFT [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] which sent its first message in 1977. Unisys is still the provider to SWIFT today.

* Burroughs produced the [[Burroughs B2500|B2500]] or &quot;medium systems&quot; computers aimed primarily at the business world. The machines were designed to execute [[COBOL]] efficiently. This included a BCD ([[Binary Coded Decimal]]) based arithmetic unit, storing and addressing the main memory using [[base 10]] numbering instead of [[Binary numeral system|binary]]. The designation for these systems was Burroughs B2500 through B49xx, followed by Unisys V-Series V340 through V560.
* Burroughs produced the [[Burroughs B1700|B1700]] or &quot;small systems&quot; computers that were designed to be [[microprogram]]med, with each process potentially getting its own [[virtual machine]] designed to be the best match to the [[programming language]] chosen for the program being run.
* The smallest general-purpose computers were the B700 &quot;[[microprocessor]]s&quot; which were used both as [[stand-alone]] systems and as special-purpose data-communications or disk-subsystem controllers.
* Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of [[Accounting Machine|accounting machines]] including both stand-alone systems such as the [[Burroughs Sensimatic|Sensimatic]], L500 and B80, and dedicated terminals including the TC500 and specialised check processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picklesnet.com/burroughs/descriptions/b80.htm Burroughs B80 Family]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1982, Burroughs began producing [[personal computer]]s, the B20 and B25 lines with the [[Intel 8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] family of 8-bit chips as the processor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/siliconvalley/pines/4011/misc-doc/Intro.htm &quot;B25 FAMILY OF UNIVERSAL WORKSTATIONS INTRODUCTION&quot;], 1987&lt;/ref&gt; These ran the [[Convergent Technologies Operating System|BTOS]] operating system, which Burroughs licensed from [[Convergent Technologies (Unisys)|Convergent Technologies]]. These machines implemented an early [[Local Area Network]] to share a [[hard disk]] between [[workgroup]] users. These microcomputers were later manufactured in [[Kunming]], [[China]] for use in China under agreement with Burroughs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/business/china-deal-for-burroughs.html &quot;China Deal For Burroughs&quot;], ''The New York Times'', [[Associated Press|AP]] story, January 3, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs also made military computers, such as the D825 (the &quot;D&quot; prefix signifying it was for defense industrial use), in its Great Valley Laboratory in [[Paoli, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smecc.org/burroughs_buic_-__an_gsa-51__sage_backup.htm &quot;Burroughs BUIC - AN/GSA-51 SAGE Backup&quot;], archived at SMECC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James P. Anderson , Samuel A. Hoffman , Joseph Shifman , Robert J. Williams, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1461527&amp;CFID=19495367&amp;CFTOKEN=10286766 &quot;D825 - a multiple-computer system for command &amp; control&quot;], Proceedings of the December 4-6, 1962, fall joint computer conference, p.86-96, December 04-06, 1962, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (doi&gt;10.1145/1461518.1461527)&lt;/ref&gt; The D825 was, according to some scholars, the first true multiprocessor computer.&lt;ref&gt;Enslow, Philip H., Jr., &quot;Multiprocessor Organization - A Survey&quot;, Computing Surveys, Vol. 9, March 1977, pp.103–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Paoli was also home to the Defense and Space Group Marketing Division.&lt;ref&gt;

==Merger==
In September 1986, Burroughs Corporation merged with [[Sperry Corporation]] to form [[Unisys]]. For a time, the combined company retained the Burroughs processors as the A and V systems lines. However, as the market for large systems shifted from proprietary architectures to common servers, the company eventually dropped these product lines.

== Re-emergence of the Burroughs name ==
[[Image:Burroughs Payment Systems Plymouth Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|Burroughs Payment Systems in [[Plymouth, Michigan]], 2011]]
In 2010, UNISYS sold off its Payment Systems Division to Marlin Equity Partners, a California-based private investment firm, which incorporated it as Burroughs Payment Systems based in [[Plymouth, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burroughs.com/NewsEvents.aspx &quot;Marlin Equity Partners acquires elements of Unisys payment systems&quot;], Burroughs press release, February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burroughs.com Burroughs Payment Systems website]. &quot;The re-emergence of a company brand that began over 100 years ago solidifies our commitment to provide innovative solutions to your business needs.  Back then, the introduction of Burroughs adding machines simplified daily operations for thousands of corporations.  Today, our focus on payment systems related technologies and services has resulted in countless efficiencies for financial institutions and businesses alike who process check and cash transactions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in popular culture==
Burroughs B205 hardware has appeared as props in many [[Hollywood]] TV and movie productions from the 1960s onwards. For example a B205 [[front panel|console]] was often shown in the TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' as the ''Bat Computer''; also as the computer in ''[[Lost in Space]]''. B205 tape drives were often seen in shows such as ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' and ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/B205/onscreen.html &quot;B205 On Screen&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Trier Basilika Electoral.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Roman empire|Roman]] Constantine [[Basilica]] in [[Trier]], [[Germany]], built in the 4th century with fired bricks as audience hall for [[Constantine I]]]]

The oldest discovered bricks, originally made from shaped mud and dating to before 7500 B.C. were found at [[Tell Aswad]] then later in the upper [[Tigris]] region and in southeast [[Anatolia]] close to [[Diyarbakir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikis.ifporient.org/archeologie/index.php/Tell_Aswad IFP Orient - Tell Aswad]&lt;/ref&gt; Other more recent findings, dated between 7,000 and 6,395 B.C., come from [[Jericho]] and [[Catal Hüyük]]. The first sun-dried bricks were made in Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq), in the ancient city of [[Ur]] in about 4000&amp;nbsp;BC, although the arch used for drying the bricks was not actually found.&lt;ref name=&quot;BriOnl&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--**Please See reference 'Elements of Civil Engineering = Mimi Das Saikia,' which supports the above claims**Being much more resistant to cold and moist weather conditions, brick enabled the construction of permanent buildings in regions where the harsher climate precluded the use of mud bricks.  Bricks have the added warmth benefit of storing heat energy from the sun during the day and continuing to release heat after sunset.  /hiding unsourced paragraph that does not go with sources I have found.  Feel free to add it back when there are sources for NPOV.  I will assume good faith that these are legitimate and verifiable info for now since I am no expert./--&gt;

In particular, it is evident from the ruins of [[Buhen]], [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]].

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] made use of fired bricks, and the [[Roman legion]]s, which operated mobile [[kiln]]s {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, introduced bricks to many parts of the empire. [[Roman brick]]s are often stamped with the mark of the legion that supervised their production. The use of bricks in southern and western [[Germany]], for example, can be traced back to traditions already described by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]].

In [[History of China|pre-modern China]], brick-making was the job of a lowly and unskilled artisan, but a kiln master was respected as a step above the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 19 20&quot;&gt;Brook, 19&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt; Early traces of bricks were found in a ruin site in [[Xi'an]] in 2009 dated back about 3800 years ago. Before this discovery, it is widely believed that bricks appeared about 3000 years ago in the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty since the earliest bricks were found in [[Western Zhou]] ruins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takungpao.com/news/10/01/28/_IN-1208245.htm Earliest Chinese building brick appeared in Xi'an (中國最早磚類建材在西安現身)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/art_main.php?&amp;iss_id=20100128&amp;sec_id=10793096&amp;art_id=13673124 China's earliest building material]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2010-01/29/content_12896997.htm China's first brick, possible earliest brick in China] (藍田出土&quot;中華第一磚&quot; 疑似我國最早的&quot;磚&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; These bricks are the earliest bricks discovered that were made by a fired process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20100130/2743984.html Earliest fired brick discovered in Xi'an] (西安發現全球最早燒制磚)&lt;/ref&gt; Early descriptions of the production process and [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]] techniques used for bricks can be found in the [[Song Dynasty]] carpenter's manual ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', published in 1103 by the government official Li Jie, who was put in charge of overseeing public works for the central government's construction agency. The historian [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]] writes of the production process in [[Ming Dynasty]] China (aided with visual illustrations from the ''[[Song Yingxing|Tiangong Kaiwu]]'' encyclopedic text published in 1637):

[[Image:Shebli2.jpg|thumb|left|The brickwork of [[Shebeli Tower]] in [[Iran]] displays 12th century craftsmanship]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the kilnmaster had to make sure that the temperature inside the kiln stayed at a level that caused the clay to shimmer with the colour of molten gold or silver. He also had to know when to quench the kiln with water so as to produce the surface glaze. To anonymous laborers fell the less skilled stages of brick production: mixing clay and water, driving oxen over the mixture to trample it into a thick paste, scooping the paste into standardized wooden frames (to produce a brick roughly 42&amp;thinsp;[[centimetres|cm]] long, 20&amp;thinsp;cm wide, and 10&amp;thinsp;cm thick), smoothing the surfaces with a wire-strung bow, removing them from the frames, printing the fronts and backs with stamps that indicated where the bricks came from and who made them, loading the kilns with fuel (likelier wood than coal), stacking the bricks in the kiln, removing them to cool while the kilns were still hot, and bundling them into pallets for transportation. It was hot, filthy work.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 20&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea of signing the worker's name and birth date on the brick and the place where it was made was not new to the Ming era and had little or nothing to do with vanity.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC&amp;ndash;206 BC), the government required [[blacksmith]]s and weapon-makers to engrave their names onto weapons in order to trace the weapons back to them, lest their weapons should prove to be of a lower quality than the standard required by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 22&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, bricks from Northern-Western [[Italy]] were re-introduced to Northern Germany, where an independent tradition evolved. It culminated in the so-called [[brick Gothic]], a reduced style of [[Gothic architecture]] that flourished in [[Northern Europe]], especially in the regions around the [[Baltic Sea]] which are without natural rock resources. Brick Gothic buildings, which are built almost exclusively of bricks, are to be found in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].

During the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]], visible brick walls were unpopular and the [[brickwork]] was often covered with [[plaster]]. It was only during the mid-18th century that visible brick walls regained some degree of popularity, as illustrated by the Dutch Quarter of [[Potsdam]], for example.

[[Image:Chilehaus.jpg|thumb|[[Chilehaus|Chile house]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]

The transport in bulk of building materials such as bricks over long distances was rare before the age of canals, railways, roads and heavy goods vehicles. Before this time bricks were generally made close to their point of intended use. It has been estimated{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that in England in the 18th century carrying bricks by horse and cart for ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) over the poor roads then existing could more than double their price.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Bricks were often used for reasons of speed and economy, even in areas where stone was available. The buildings of the Industrial Revolution in Britain were largely constructed of brick and timber due to the demand created. During the building boom of the 19th century in the eastern seaboard cities of [[Boston]] and [[New York City]], for example, locally made bricks were often used in construction in preference to the [[brownstone]]s of [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]] for these reasons.

The trend of building upwards for offices that emerged towards the beginning of the 19th century displaced brick in favor of cast and wrought iron and later steel and [[concrete]]. Some early '[[skyscrapers]]' were made in masonry, and demonstrated the limitations of the material – for example, the [[Monadnock Building]] in Chicago (opened in 1896) is masonry and just 17 stories high; the ground walls are almost {{convert|6|ft}} thick, clearly building any higher would lead to excessive loss of internal floor space on the lower floors. Brick was revived for high structures in the 1950s following work by the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] {{dn}} and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK. This method produced 18-story structures with bearing walls no thicker than a single brick (150–225&amp;nbsp;mm). This potential has not been fully developed because of the ease and speed in building with other materials; in the late-20th century brick was confined to low- or medium-rise structures or as a thin decorative cladding over concrete-and-steel buildings or for internal non-load-bearing walls.

==Methods of manufacture==
[[Image:BrickMakingTurnOfTheCentury.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Brick making at the beginning of the 20th century.]]

&quot;Bricks&quot; for building may be made from [[clay]], [[shale]], soft slate, [[calcium silicate]], concrete, or shaped from quarried stone. However, true bricks are ceramic, and therefore created by the action of heat and cooling.

Clay is the most common material, with modern clay bricks formed in one of three processes - soft mud, dry press, or extruded.

Normally, brick contains the following ingredients&lt;ref name=&quot;punmia&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sWZxu_muxyIC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=constituents+of+brick&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q4MCJdOuDo&amp;sig=ed_Ey99QWGP63-yUoc_dC8O_LvE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wdn3TOncHInksQPTq_3jAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=constituents%20of%20brick&amp;f=false Constituents of Brick]&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Silica (sand) - 50% to 60% by weight
# Alumina (clay) - 20% to 30% by weight
# Lime - 2 to 5% by weight
# Iron oxide - 5 to 6% (not greater than 7%) by weight
# Magnesia - less than 1% by weight

===Mud bricks===
The soft mud method is the most common, as it is the most economical. It starts with the raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25-30% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] press. The shaped clay is then fired (&quot;burned&quot;) at 900-1000 °C to achieve strength.

====Rail kilns====
[[Image:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at [[kiln]] near [[Ngcobo]] in the former [[Transkei]] in 2007.]]
In modern brickworks, this is usually done in a continuously fired tunnel [[kiln]], in which the bricks move slowly through the kiln on conveyors, rails, or kiln cars to achieve consistency for all bricks. The bricks often have added lime, ash, and organic matter to speed the burning.

====Bull's Trench Kilns====
In [[India]], brick making is typically a manual process. The most common type of brick kiln in use there are '''Bull's Trench Kiln''' (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.

An oval or circular trench, 6–9 meters wide, 2-2.5 meters deep, and 100–150 meters in circumference, is dug. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with &quot;green&quot; (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.

In operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile; cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport. In the middle the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, [[wood]], oil, debris, and so on.) through access holes in the roof above the trench.

[[Image:Roskilde domkirke west fassade.jpg|thumb|left|West face of [[Roskilde Cathedral]] in Roskilde, Denmark.]]

The advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying them), and finally out the chimney where the rising gases create suction which pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.

As with the rail process above, the BTK process is continuous. A half dozen laborers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000-25,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry pressed bricks===
The dry press method is similar to mud brick but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.

===Extruded bricks===
For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10-15% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20-25% water (soft extrusion). This is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the proper width and depth. This is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method, as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce holes or other perforations. The introduction of holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have thermal properties different from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150 °C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the [[kiln]].
European-style extruded bricks or blocks are used in single-wall construction with finishes applied inside and outside. Their many voids are a greater proportion of the volume than the solid, thin walls of fired clay. Such bricks are made in 15, 25, 30, 42 and 50-cm widths. Some models have very high thermal insulation performance suitable for zero-energy buildings.

=== Calcium silicate bricks ===
The raw materials for [[calcium silicate]] bricks include [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] mixed with [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]] or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated, the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for two or three hours to speed the chemical hardening. The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick (and brick-layer). The bricks can be made in a variety of colours, white is common but pastel shades can be achieved.

Sck bricks are common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s,, and are known as &quot;Mexitegel&quot; (en: Mexi[can] Bricks).

In India these are known as Fly ash bricks, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime and gypsum) process.

Calcium silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 - 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick). It has lower embodied energy than cement based man-made stone and clay brick {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

==Influence on fired colour==
[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|right|thumb|270px|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]]]]
The fired colour of clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of raw materials, the firing temperature and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example pink coloured bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues, if the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. Calcium silicate bricks have a wider range of shades and colours, depending on the colourants used. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White.

&quot;Bricks&quot; formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed blocks, and are typically pale grey in colour. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an &quot;egglayer&quot; or static machine. The finished blocks are cured rather than fired using low-pressure steam. Concrete blocks are manufactured in a much wider range of shapes and sizes than clay bricks and are also available with a wider range of face treatments - a number of which are to simulate the appearance of clay bricks.

An impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a &quot;slip,&quot; which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.

Natural stone bricks are of limited modern utility, due to their enormous comparative mass, the consequent foundation needs, and the time-consuming and skilled labour needed in their construction and laying. They are very durable and considered more handsome than clay bricks by some. Only a few stones are suitable for bricks. Common materials are [[granite]], [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]]. Other stones may be used (for example, [[marble]], [[slate]], [[quartzite]], and so on.) but these tend to be limited to a particular locality.

==Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength==
[[Image:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]
For efficient handling and laying bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat and as a result the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100&amp;nbsp;mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200&amp;nbsp;mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid [[Brickwork|''bonded'']] in a structure to increase its stability and strength (for an example of this, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width.

A bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported Dutch brick, too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialized insulation materials.

The correct brick for a job can be picked from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.

In [[England]], the length and the width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries, but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&amp;nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&amp;nbsp;mm) more recently. In the [[United States]], modern bricks are usually about 8 × 4 × {{frac|2|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;inches (203 × 102 × 57&amp;nbsp;mm). In the [[United Kingdom]], the usual size of a modern brick is 215 × 102.5 × 65&amp;nbsp;mm (about {{frac|8|5|8}} × {{frac|4|1|8}} × {{frac|2|5|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches), which, with a nominal 10&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch) mortar joint, forms a ''[[unit size]]'' of 225 × 112.5 × 75&amp;nbsp;mm (9 × {{frac|4|1|2}} × 3&amp;nbsp;inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.

Some brickmakers create innovative sizes and shapes for bricks used for plastering (and therefore not visible) where their inherent mechanical properties are more important than the visual ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crammix.co.za/maxilite.htm Crammix ''Maxilite'']&lt;/ref&gt; These bricks are usually slightly larger, but not as large as blocks and offer the following advantages:
* a slightly larger brick requires less mortar and handling (fewer bricks) which reduces cost
* ribbed exterior aids plastering
* more complex interior cavities allow improved insulation, while maintaining strength.

Blocks have a much greater range of sizes. Standard coordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400×200, 450×150, 450×200, 450×225, 450×300, 600×150, 600×200, and 600×225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m³: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on.; but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450–850&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.

Bricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be &quot;frogged,&quot; having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow

The term &quot;frog&quot; for the indentation on one bed of the brick is a word that often excites curiosity as to its origin. The most likely explanation is that brickmakers also call the block that is placed in the mould to form the indentation a frog. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood. When these are wet and have clay on them they resemble the amphibious kind of frog and this is where they got their name. Over time this term also came to refer to the indentation left by them.

[[Image:Dixie Highway Maitland.jpg|thumb|A brick section of the old [[Dixie Highway]], [[United States of America|United States]]]]

The compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about 1000&amp;nbsp;lbf/in² to 15,000&amp;nbsp;lbf/in² (7 to 105 [[MPa]] or N/mm² ), varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 [[MPa]], although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20–40 [[MPa]].

==Use==

Bricks are used for building and [[pavement (material)|pavement]]. In the USA, brick pavement was found incapable of withstanding heavy traffic, but it is coming back into use as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]] were paved with brick. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries for lining [[furnace]]s. They have various uses, especially [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, [[refractory|refractoriness]] under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory brick industry, especially in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and the [[Netherlands]].

In the United Kingdom, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses in the UK are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.

In the UK a [[redbrick university]] is one founded and built in the Victorian era, often as a [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|technical college]]. The term is used as differentiation from older, more [[classics]]-oriented universities.

Colombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red brick in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries&amp;oref=slogin&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.

[[File:Bartók Béla 1927.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Béla Bartók in 1927]]

'''Béla Viktor János Bartók''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|ɑr|t|ɒ|k}}; {{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈbɒrtoːk}}; March 25, 1881 – September 26, 1945) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] composer and pianist. He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century and is regarded, along with [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], as Hungary's greatest composer (Gillies 2001). Through his collection and analytical study of [[folk music]], he was one of the founders of [[ethnomusicology]].

==Biography==
===Childhood and early years (1881–98)===
Béla Bartók was born in the small [[Banat]]ian town of Nagyszentmiklós in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (since 1920 [[Sânnicolau Mare]], [[Romania]]) on March 25, 1881. Bartók's family reflected some of the ethno-cultural diversities of the country. His mother, Paula (born Paula Voit), had German as a mother tongue, but was ethnically of &quot;mixed Hungarian&quot; origin: Her maiden name Voit is German, probably of Saxon origin from Upper Hungary (Since 1920 in Czechoslovakia, since 1993 in Slovakia), though she spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] fluently. Among her closest forefathers there were family names like Polereczky (Magyarized Polish) and Fegyveres ([[Hungarian people|Magyar]]). His father, Béla Sr., considered himself thoroughly Hungarian, because on his father's side the Bartók family was a Hungarian lower noble family, originating from [[Borsod county]] (Bónis n.d., {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}; Bartók 1981, 13), though his mother was from a Roman Catholic [[Serbs|Serbian family]] (Bayley 2001, 16). Béla displayed notable musical talent very early in life: according to his mother, he could distinguish between different dance rhythms that she played on the piano before he learned to speak in complete sentences (Gillies 1990, 6). By the age of four, he was able to play 40 pieces on the piano; his mother began formally teaching him the next year.

Béla was a small and sickly child and suffered from severe eczema until the age of five (Gillies 1990, 5). In 1888, when he was seven, his father (the director of an agricultural school) died suddenly. Béla's mother then took him and his sister, Erzsebet, to live in [[Nagyszőlős]] (today [[Vinogradiv]], [[Ukraine]]) and then to [[Pozsony]] (German: Pressburg, today [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]). In Pozsony, Béla gave his first public recital at age eleven to a warm critical reception. Among the pieces he played was his own first composition, written two years previously: a short piece called &quot;The Course of the Danube&quot; (de Toth 1999). Shortly thereafter [[László Erkel]] accepted him as a pupil.

===Early musical career (1899–1908)===
[[File:Bartok tablo.jpg|thumb|right|Bartók's signature on his high school graduation photograph, dated September 9, 1899]]
From 1899 to 1903, Bartók studied piano under [[István Thomán]], a former student of [[Franz Liszt]], and composition under [[János Koessler]] at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|Royal Academy of Music in Budapest]]. There he met [[Zoltán Kodály]], who influenced him greatly and became his lifelong friend and colleague. In 1903, Bartók wrote his first major [[orchestra]]l work, ''[[Kossuth (Bartók)|Kossuth]]'', a [[symphonic poem]] which honored [[Lajos Kossuth]], hero of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].

The music of [[Richard Strauss]], whom he met in 1902 at the [[Budapest]] premiere of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]],'' strongly influenced his early work. When visiting a holiday resort in the summer of 1904, Bartók overheard a young nanny, Lidi Dósa from [[Kibéd]] in Transylvania, sing folk songs to the children in her care. This sparked his life-long dedication to folk music. 

From 1907 he also began to be influenced by the French composer [[Claude Debussy]], whose compositions Kodály had brought back from Paris. Bartók's large-scale orchestral works were still in the style of [[Johannes Brahms]] and Richard Strauss, but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in folk music. The first piece to show clear signs of this new interest is the ''[[String Quartet No. 1 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 1]]'' in A minor (1908), which contains folk-like elements.

In 1907, Bartók began teaching as a piano professor at the Royal Academy. This position freed him from touring Europe as a pianist and enabled him to work in Hungary.  Among his notable students were [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Sir Georg Solti]], [[György Sándor]], [[Ernő Balogh]], and [[Lili Kraus]].  After Bartók moved to the United States, he taught [[Jack Beeson]] and [[Violet Archer]].

In 1908, he and Kodály traveled into the countryside to collect and research old [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture.  They made some surprising discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as [[Romani people|Gypsy]] music. The classic example is [[Franz Liszt]]'s famous ''[[Hungarian Rhapsodies]]'' for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by [[Romani people|Romani]] bands of the time. In contrast, Bartók and Kodály discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on [[pentatonic]] scales, similar to those in Asian folk traditions, such as those of Central Asia and [[Siberia]].

Bartók and Kodály quickly set about incorporating elements of such Magyar peasant music into their compositions. They both frequently quoted folk song melodies ''verbatim'' and wrote pieces derived entirely from authentic songs. An example is his two volumes entitled ''For Children'' for solo piano, containing 80 folk tunes to which he wrote accompaniment. Bartók's style in his art music compositions was a synthesis of folk music, classicism, and modernism. His melodic and harmonic sense was profoundly influenced by the folk music of Hungary, Romania, and other nations.  He was especially fond of the asymmetrical dance rhythms and pungent harmonies found in [[Bulgarian music]]. Most of his early compositions offer a blend of nationalist and late Romanticism elements.

===Middle years and career (1909–39)===
In 1909, Bartók married Márta Ziegler. Their son, Béla III, was born in 1910. After nearly 15 years together, Bartók divorced Márta in 1923.  

He then married [[Ditta Pásztory]], a piano student. She had his second son, Péter, born in 1924.

===Opera===
In 1911, Bartók wrote what was to be his only opera, ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', dedicated to Márta. He entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission, but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage (Chalmers 1995, 93). In 1917 Bartók revised the score for the 1918 première, and rewrote the ending. Following the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|1919 revolution]], he was pressured by the new Soviet government to remove the name of the librettist [[Béla Balázs]] from the opera (Chalmers 1995, 123), as he was blacklisted and had left the country for Vienna. ''Bluebeard's Castle'' received only one revival, in 1936, before Bartók emigrated.  For the remainder of his life, although he was passionately devoted to Hungary, its people and its culture, he never felt much loyalty to the government or its official establishments.

===Folk music and composition===
After his disappointment over the Fine Arts Commission competition, Bartók wrote little for two or three years, preferring to concentrate on collecting and arranging folk music.  He collected first in the [[Carpathian Basin]] (the then-[[Kingdom of Hungary in the 18th and 19th century|Kingdom of Hungary]]), where he notated [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian]], [[Music of Slovakia|Slovakian]], [[Music of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] folk music. He also collected in [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]] and in 1913 in [[Algeria]]. The outbreak of World War I forced him to stop the expeditions, and he returned to composing, writing the ballet ''[[The Wooden Prince]]'' in 1914–16 and the ''[[String Quartet No. 2 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 2]]'' in 1915–17, both influenced by [[Debussy]].

Raised as a Roman Catholic, by his early adulthood Bartók had  become an atheist.  He believed that the existence of God could not be determined and was unnecessary. He later became attracted to [[Unitarianism]] and publicly converted to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith in 1916. As an adult, his son later became president of the Hungarian Unitarian Church (Hughes 1999–2007).

Bartók wrote another ballet, ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]'' influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], as well as [[Richard Strauss]].  He next wrote his two [[violin sonata]]s (written in 1921 and 1922 respectively), which are harmonically and structurally some of his most complex pieces.  ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]'', a modern story of prostitution, robbery, and murder, was started in 1918, but not performed until 1926 because of its [[Human sexuality|sexual]] content. 

In 1927–28, Bartók wrote his [[String Quartet No. 3 (Bartók)|third]] and [[String Quartet No. 4 (Bartók)|fourth]] [[string quartet]]s, after which his compositions demonstrate his mature style.  Notable examples of this period are ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and ''[[Divertimento for String Orchestra BB 118]]'' (1939).  The ''[[String Quartet No. 5 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 5]]'' was composed in 1934, and the [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|sixth]] and last string quartet in 1939.

In 1936 he travelled to [[Turkey]] to collect and study folk music. He worked in collaboration with Turkish composer [[Ahmet Adnan Saygun]] mostly around [[Adana]] (Özgentürk 2008; Sipos 2000).

===World War II and last years in America (1940–45)===
In 1940, as the European political situation worsened after the outbreak of World War II,  Bartók was increasingly tempted to flee Hungary. He was strongly opposed to the [[Nazis]] and Hungary’s siding with Germany. After the Nazis came to power in the early 1930s, Bartók refused to give concerts in Germany and broke with his publisher there. His anti-fascist political views caused him a great deal of trouble with the establishment in Hungary. Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bartók reluctantly emigrated to the U.S. with Ditta Pásztory in July that year. They settled in New York City. After joining them in 1942, his younger son, Péter Bartók, enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. His oldest son, Béla Bartók, Jr., remained in Hungary.

Bartók never became fully at home in the US. He initially found it difficult to compose. Although well-known in America as a pianist, ethnomusicologist and teacher, he was not well known as a composer.  There was little American interest in his music during his final years.  He and his wife Ditta gave concerts.  Bartók, who had made some recordings in Hungary also recorded for [[Columbia Records]] after he came to the US; many of these recordings (some with Bartók's own spoken introductions) were later issued on LP and CD (Bartók 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 2003 2007, 2008).

Supported by a research fellowship from [[Columbia University]], for several years, Bartók and Ditta worked on a large collection of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] folk songs in Columbia's libraries.  They also translated some old Hungarian textbooks into English which were also from Columbia's libraries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Bartók's economic difficulties during his first years in America were mitigated by publication royalties, teaching and performance tours. While his finances were always precarious, he did not live and die in poverty as was the common myth. He had enough supporters to ensure that there was sufficient money and work available for him to live on.  Bartók was a proud man and did not easily accept charity. Despite being short of cash at times, he often refused money that his friends offered him out of their own pockets. Although he was not a member of the [[ASCAP]], the society paid for any medical care he needed during his last two years.  Bartók accepted this (Chalmers 1995, 196–203).

The first symptoms of his health problems began late in 1940, when his right shoulder began to show signs of stiffening. In 1942, symptoms increased and he started having bouts of fever, but the disease was not diagnosed in spite of medical examinations. Finally, in April 1944, [[leukemia]] was diagnosed, but by this time, little could be done (Chalmers 1995, 202–207).

As his body slowly failed, Bartók found more creative energy, and he produced a final set of masterpieces, partly thanks to the violinist [[Joseph Szigeti]] and the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]] (Reiner had been Bartók's friend and champion since his days as Bartók's student at the Royal Academy). Bartók's last work might well have been the [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 6]] but for [[Serge Koussevitsky]]'s [[commission (art)|commission]] for the ''[[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]]''.  Koussevitsky's [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] premièred the work in December 1944 to highly positive reviews.  ''Concerto for Orchestra'' quickly became Bartók's most popular work, although he did not live to see its full impact. In 1944, he was also commissioned by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] to write a ''[[Sonata for Solo Violin (Bartók)|Sonata for Solo Violin]]''. In 1945, Bartók composed his ''[[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bartók)|Piano Concerto No. 3]]'', a graceful and almost neo-classical work.  He began work on his ''[[Viola Concerto (Bartók)|Viola Concerto]]'', but had not completed the scoring at his death.

[[File:HUF 1000 1983 obverse.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Béla Bartók's portrait on 1,000 [[Hungarian forint]] banknote (printed in 1983; no longer in circulation).]]

Béla Bartók died at age 64 in a hospital in New York City from complications of [[leukemia]] (specifically, of secondary [[polycythemia]]) on September 26, 1945. His funeral was attended by only ten people. Among them were his wife Ditta, their son Peter, and his pianist friend [[György Sándor]] (anon. 2006). 

Bartok's body was initially interred in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in Hartsdale, New York. During the final year of communist Hungary in the late 1980s, the Hungarian government requested that his remains be exhumed and transferred back to [[Budapest]] for burial, where it arranged a [[state funeral]] for him on July 7, 1988.  He was reinterred at Budapest's [[Farkasréti Cemetery]] (Chalmers 1995, 214).

The Third Piano Concerto was nearly finished at his death. Bartok had completed only the viola part and sketches of the orchestra part for the Viola Concerto.  Both works were later completed by his pupil, [[Tibor Serly]]. György Sándor was the soloist in the first performance of the Third Piano Concerto on February 8, 1946. The Viola Concerto was revised and polished in the 1990s by Bartók's son, Peter; this version may be closer to what Bartók intended (Chalmers 1995, 210).

==Compositions==
{{See|List of compositions by Béla Bartók}}

Bartók's music reflects two trends that dramatically changed the sound of music in the 20th century: the breakdown of the [[diatonic]] system of harmony that had served composers for the previous two hundred years (Griffiths 1978, 7); and the revival of nationalism as a source for musical inspiration, a trend that began with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]] in the last half of the 19th century (Einstein 1947, 332).  In his search for new forms of tonality, Bartók turned to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the [[Carpathian Basin]] and even of Algeria and Turkey; in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques (Botstein [n.d.], §6).

One characteristic style of music is his [[Night music (Bartók)|Night music]], which he used mostly in slow movements of multi-movement ensemble or orchestral compositions in his mature period. It is characterised by &quot;eerie dissonances providing a backdrop to sounds of nature and lonely melodies&quot; (Schneider 2006, 84). An example is the third movement ''Adagio'' of his [[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]].

His music can be grouped roughly in accordance with the different periods in his life.

===Youth: Late-Romanticism (1890–1902)===
The works of his youth are of a late-Romantic style. Between 1890 and 1894 (nine to 13 years of age) he wrote 31 pieces with corresponding opus numbers. He started numbering his works anew with ‘opus 1’ in 1894 with his first large scale work, a piano sonata. Up to 1902, Bartók wrote in total 74 works which can be considered in Romantic style. Most of these early compositions are either scored for piano solo or include a piano. Additionally, there is some chamber music for strings. Compared to his later achievements, these works are of less importance.

===New influences (1903–11)===
Under the influence of [[Richard Strauss]] (among other works ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Richard Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'') (Stevens 1993, 15–17&lt;!--Caution: if these pages really are from the 1953 first edition, the Bibliography needs to be changed.  The ISBN cited there was for the third edition of 1993.--&gt;), Bartók composed in 1903 [[Kossuth (Bartók)|Kossuth]], a symphonic poem in ten tableaux. In 1904 followed his ''Rhapsody for piano and orchestra'' which he numbered opus 1 again, marking it himself as the start of a new era in his music. An even more important occurrence of this year was his overhearing the eighteen-year-old nanny Lidi Dósa from [[Transylvania]] sing folk songs, sparking Bartók’s life long dedication to folk music (Stevens 1993, 22). When criticised for not composing his own melodies{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Bartók pointed out that [[Molière]] and [[Shakespeare]] mostly based their plays on well-known stories too. Regarding the incorporation of folk music into art music he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The question is, what are the ways in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach’s treatment of chorales. [...] Another method [...] is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above. [...] There is yet a third way [...] Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue. (Bartók 1931/1976, 341–44.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bartók became first acquainted with [[Debussy]]’s music in 1907 and regarded his music highly. In an interview in 1939 Bartók said
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Debussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities. In that, he was just as important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? (Moreux 1953, 92) &lt;/blockquote&gt; Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made [[Ferruccio Busoni]] exclaim ‘At last something truly new!’ (Bartók, 1948, 2:83&lt;!--It would be preferable to cite the letter from the English edition, for the benefit of readers not fluent in Hungarian.--&gt;). Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera ''[[Bluebeard’s Castle]]''. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements (Gillies 1993, 404; Stevens 1964, 47–49).

===New inspiration and experimentation (1916–21)===
His pessimistic attitude towards composing was lifted by the stormy and inspiring contact with Klára Gombossy in the summer of 1915 (Gillies 1993, 405). This interesting episode in Bartók's life remained hidden until it was researched by Denijs Dille between 1979 and 1989 (Dille 1990, 257–77). Bartók started composing again, including the Suite for piano opus 14 (1916), and ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]'' (1918) and he completed ''The Wooden Prince'' (1917).

Bartók felt the result of World War I as a personal tragedy (Stevens 1993, 3&lt;!--If the page number is from the first edition of 1953, this may require correction. The ISBN cited in the bibliography was for the third edition of 1993.--&gt;).  Many regions he loved were severed from [[Hungary]]: [[Transylvania]], the [[Banat]] where he was born, and [[Pozsony]] where his mother lived. Additionally, the political relations between Hungary and the other successor states to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] prohibited his folk music research outside of Hungary (Somfai, 1996, 18). Thrown largely onto himself, he experimented with extreme compositional practices, the peak being his Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1 (Op. 21) and No. 2.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Bartók also wrote the noteworthy ''Eight Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs'' in 1920, and the sunny ''Dance Suite'' in 1923, the year of his second marriage.

===&quot;Synthesis of East and West&quot; (1926–45)===
In 1926, Bartók needed a significant piece for piano and orchestra with which he could tour in Europe and America. In the preparation for writing his ''[[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Bartók)|First Piano Concerto]]'', he wrote his Sonata, ''[[Out of Doors]]'', and ''Nine Little Pieces'', all for solo piano (Gillies 1993, 173). He increasingly found his own voice in his maturity. The style of his last period—named &quot;Synthesis of East and West&quot; (Gillies 1993, 189)—is hard to define let alone to put under one term. In his mature period, Bartók wrote relatively few works but most of them are large-scale compositions for large settings. Only his voice works have programmatic titles and his late works often adhere to classical forms.

Among his masterworks are all the six [[List of string quartets by Béla Bartók|string quartets]] (1908, 1917, 1927, 1928, 1934, and 1939), the ''[[Cantata Profana]]'' (1930, Bartók declared that this was the work he felt and professed to be his most personal &quot;credo&quot;, Szabolcsi 1974, 186), the ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936), the ''[[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]]'' (1943) and the ''[[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bartók)|Third Piano Concerto]]'' (1945).

Bartók also made a lasting contribution to the literature for younger students: for his son Péter's music lessons, he composed ''[[Mikrokosmos (Béla Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]'', a six-volume collection of graded piano pieces.

==Analysis==
===Analytic approaches===
[[Paul Wilson (music theorist)|Paul Wilson]] lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bartók's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the [[Carpathian basin]] and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional [[Diatonic functionality|harmonic functions]] associated with major and minor scales (Wilson 1992, 2–4).

Although Bartók claimed in his writings that his music is always tonal, it rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. [[George Perle]] and Elliott Antokoletz focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry.  Others view Bartok's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols. [[Richard Cohn]] argues that [[Inversion (music)#Inversional_equivalency|inversional symmetry]] is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads. Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring [[polymodal chromaticism]], [[projected set]]s, [[privileged pattern]]s, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone aggregate, [[octatonic scale]] (and [[alpha chord]]), the diatonic and heptatonia seconda seven-note scales, and less often the whole tone scale and the primary pentatonic collection (Wilson 1992, 24–29).

He rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his ''Second Violin Concerto'', commenting that he &quot;wanted to show [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal&quot; (Gillies 1990, 185). More thoroughly, in the first eight measures of the last movement of his ''Second Quartet'', all notes gradually gather with the twelfth (G♭) sounding for the first time on the last beat of measure 8, marking the end of the first section. The aggregate is partitioned in the opening of the ''Third String Quartet'' with C♯–D–D♯–E in the accompaniment (strings) while the remaining pitch classes are used in the melody (violin 1) and more often as 7–35 (diatonic or &quot;white-key&quot; collection) and 5–35 (pentatonic or &quot;black-key&quot; collection) such as in no. 6 of the ''Eight Improvisations''. There, the primary theme is on the black keys in the left hand, while the right accompanies with triads from the white keys. In measures 50–51 in the third movement of the ''Fourth Quartet'', the first violin and 'cello play black-key chords, while the second violin and viola play stepwise diatonic lines (Wilson 1992, 25). On the other hand, from as early as the Suite for piano, op. 14 (1914), he occasionally employed a form of [[serialism]] based on compound interval cycles, some of which are maximally distributed, multi-aggregate cycles (Martins 2004, Gollin 2007).
[[File:Bartok Bela Baja.jpg|thumb|right|Béla Bartók memorial plaque in [[Baja, Hungary]]]]

[[Erno Lendvai]] (1971) analyses Bartók's works as being based on two opposing tonal systems, that of the [[acoustic scale]] and the [[axis system]], as well as using the [[golden section]] as a structural principle.

[[Milton Babbitt]], in his 1949 critique of Bartók's string quartets, criticized Bartók for using tonality and non tonal methods unique to each piece. Babbitt noted that &quot;Bartók's solution was a specific one, it cannot be duplicated&quot; (Babbitt 1949, 385). Bartók's use of &quot;two organizational principles&quot;—tonality for large scale relationships and the piece-specific method for moment to moment thematic elements—was a problem for Babbitt, who worried that the &quot;highly attenuated tonality&quot; requires extreme non-harmonic methods to create a feeling of closure (Babbitt 1949, 377–78).

===Catalogues and opus numbers===
The cataloguing of Bartók's works is somewhat complex.  Bartók assigned opus numbers to his works three times, the last of these series ending with the Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921. He ended this practice because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works.  Since his death, three attempts—two full and one partial—have been made at cataloguing.  The first, and still most widely used, is [[András Szőllősy]]'s chronological Sz. numbers, from 1 to 121.   [[Denijs Dille]] subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1–25) thematically, as DD numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of [[László Somfai]]; this is a chronological index with works identified by BB numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the Béla Bartók Thematic Catalogue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}.

'''Bill Haley''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|iː}}; July 6, 1925 – February 9, 1981) was one of the first American [[rock and roll]] musicians. He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] and their hit song &quot;[[Rock Around the Clock]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audiobooksonline.com/188595915X.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and career=== 
Bill Haley was born in Highland Park, Michigan. Because of the effects of the Great Depression on the Detroit area, his father moved the family to Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, near the town of Chester, when Bill was seven years old. Haley's father played the banjo, and his mother was a technically accomplished keyboardist with classical training. Haley told the story that when he made a simulated guitar out of cardboard, his parents bought him a real one.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. pages 15,17. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

The anonymous sleeve notes accompanying the 1956 Decca album &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; describe Haley's early life and career thus: &quot;Bill got his first professional job at the age of 13, playing and entertaining at an auction for the fee of $1 a night. Very soon after this he formed a group of equally enthusiastic youngsters and managed to get quite a few local bookings for his band.&quot;

The sleeve notes continue: &quot;When Bill Haley was fifteen [c.1940] he left home with his guitar and very little else and set out on the hard road to fame and fortune. The next few years, continuing this story in a fairy-tale manner, were hard and poverty stricken, but cramful of useful experience. Apart from learning how to exist  on one meal a day and other artistic exercises, he worked at an open-air park show, sang and yodelled with any band that would have him and worked with a traveling medicine show. Eventually he got a job with a popular group known as the &quot;Down Homers&quot; while they were in Hartford, Connecticut. Soon after this he decided, as all successful people must decide at some time or another, to be his own boss again - and he has been that ever since.’ [Note: these notes fail to account for his early band, known as the Four Aces of Western Swing. They later changed their name to avoid confusion with the pop vocal group the Four Aces].

The sleeve notes conclude: &quot;For six years Bill Haley was a musical director of Radio Station WPWA in Chester, Pennsylvania, and led his own band all through this period. It was then known as Bill Haley's Saddlemen, indicating their definite leaning toward the tough Western style. They continued playing in clubs as well as over the radio around Philadelphia, and in 1951 made their first recordings.&quot;

===Bill Haley &amp; His Comets===
[[Image:Bill Haley, 1974, Liége 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Haley and the Comets performing during 1974]]
{{main|Bill Haley &amp; His Comets}}
During the [[Labor Day]] weekend in 1952, The Saddlemen were renamed '''Bill Haley with Haley's Comets''' (inspired by a popular mispronunciation of [[Halley's Comet]]), and in 1953, Haley's recording of &quot;[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]&quot; (co-written by Haley and his bass player, [[Marshall Lytle]] although Lytle would not receive credit until 2001) became the first rock and roll song to hit the American charts, peaking at no.15 on Billboard and no.11 on Cash Box. Soon after, the band's name was revised to '''Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.'''

In 1953, a song called &quot;[[(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock|Rock Around the Clock]]&quot; was written for Haley.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to record it until April 12, 1954. Initially, it was relatively unsuccessful, staying at the charts for only one week, but Haley soon scored a major worldwide hit with a cover version of [[Big Joe Turner]]'s &quot;[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]&quot;, which went on to sell a million copies and became the first ever rock 'n' roll song to enter [[United Kingdom|British]] singles charts in December 1954 and became a Gold Record. He retained elements of the original, but threw some country music aspects in to the song (specifically, Western Swing) and cleaned up the lyrics. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; to a wider, mostly white audience after years of it being considered an underground genre. When &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; appeared behind the opening credits of the 1955 film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' starring [[Glenn Ford]], it soared to the top of the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart for eight weeks. The single is commonly used as a convenient line of demarcation between the &quot;rock era&quot; and the music industry that preceded it; ''Billboard'' separated its statistical tabulations into 1890-1954 and 1955–present. After the record rose to number one, Haley was quickly given the title &quot;Father of Rock and Roll,&quot; by the media, and by teenagers that had come to embrace the new style of music. 

&quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was the first record ever to sell over one million copies in both Britain and Germany and, in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour [[Europe]]. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as &quot;[[See You Later, Alligator]]&quot; and he starred in the first rock and roll musical movies ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'', both in 1956. Haley was soon eclipsed in the United States by the younger, sexier [[Elvis]], but continued to enjoy great popularity in [[Latin America]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] through the 1960s.

===Death and legacy===
A self-admitted [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] (as indicated in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]]), Haley fought a battle with alcohol into the 1970s. Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1960s with the [[Rock and roll revival]] movement and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European [[Sonet Records]] label. After performing for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at a command performance in 1979, Haley made his final performances in [[South Africa]] in May and June 1980. Prior to the South African tour, he was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], and a planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 was canceled. 

The October 25, 1980 edition of the German paper ''Bild'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. It quoted British manager Patrick Maylan as saying that Haley &quot;had taken a fit and went over the seat. He didn't recognize anyone anymore&quot; after being taken to his home in Beverly Hills. It also reported that a doctor at the clinic where Haley had been taken said, &quot;The tumor can't be operated on anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Haley 1982. page 154&quot;&gt;Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. page 154. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Berliner Zeitung&quot; reported a few days later that Haley had collapsed after a performance in Texas and been taken to the hospital in his home town of [[Harlingen, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Haley 1982. page 154&quot;/&gt;

Despite his ill health, Haley began compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he went back to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]], where he died early in the morning of February 9, 1981.

Martha, Bill's wife who was with him in these troubling times, denies he had a brain tumor as does his old, very close friend, Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Bill did not want to go on the road any more and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. According to McCallum, &quot;It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card.&quot;

It was obvious that his drinking problem was getting worse. According to Martha, by this time she and Bill fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out so he moved out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. &quot;There were days we never saw him,&quot; said his daughter Martha Maria.

In addition to the drinking problems, it had become obvious that he also was having serious mental problems; Martha Maria said that, &quot;It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking.&quot; After having been jailed by the Harlingen Police, Martha had the judge put Haley in the hospital where he was seen by a psychiatrist who said Bill's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction but said Bill would have to stop drinking. Martha said, &quot;This is pointless.&quot; She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out the his room in the pool house and the downward spiral continued until his death. &lt;ref&gt;Falling Comet. Michael Hall. 2011. Texas Monthly, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley's death certificate listed &quot;Natural causes: Most likely heart attack&quot; as the 'Immediate Cause' of death. The next lines, 'Due to, or as a consequence Of&quot; were blank.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. page 164. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives in which he seemed incoherently drunk or ill. Haley's first wife has been quoted as saying, &quot;He would call and ramble and dwell on the past, his mind was really warped.&quot; A belligerent phone call to a business associate was taped and gives evidence of Haley's troubled state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. pages 155-159. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports immediately following his death indicated Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in his final weeks, although beyond a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released a year later, which described Haley painting the windows of his home black, there is little information extant about Haley's final days. 

Haley was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Jim and Whitcomb, Ian (2005).  ''Rock Around the Clock: The Record that Started the Rock Revolution!'', p. 180. Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 087930829X&lt;/ref&gt;

Songwriters Tom Russell and [[Dave Alvin]] addressed Haley's demise in musical terms with &quot;Haley's Comet&quot; on Alvin's 1991 album ''Blue Blvd.'' [[Dwight Yoakam]] sang backup on the tribute.

Haley's original Comets still tour the world. They released a concert [[DVD]] in 2004 on Hydra Records, played the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] in 2005, and performed at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]] in 2006-07.

In March 2007, the Original Comets pre-opened the Bill Haley Museum in [[Munich, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockithydra.de&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2007, ex-Comets guitar player Bill Turner opened the Bill Haley Museum for the public.

====Asteroid====
:''Main article - [[79896 Billhaley]]''

In February 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] announced the naming of [[asteroid]] [[79896 Billhaley]] to mark the 25th anniversary of Bill Haley's death.

====Children====
Married three times, Bill Haley had at least eight children. John W. Haley, his eldest son, wrote ''Sound and Glory'', a biography of Haley, while his youngest daughter, [[Gina Haley]], is a professional musician based in [[Texas]]. Scott Haley is an athlete, while Haley's youngest son, Pedro Haley, is also a musician. 

He also had a daughter, Martha Maria, from his last marriage with Martha Velasco.

Bill Haley Jr. (Haley's second son and first with Joan Barbara &quot;Cuppy&quot; Haley-Hahn) publishes a regional business magazine in Southeastern Pennsylvania (''Route 422 Business Advisor''). He sings and plays guitar with a band called &quot;Lager Rhythms,&quot; and appeared with the &quot;Original Comets&quot; at the Bubba Mac Shack in [[Somers Point, New Jersey]], in 2004 and 2005, and at the Twin Bar re-dedication ceremony in [[Gloucester City, New Jersey]], in 2007. He is currently writing a biography about his father, concentrating on the years 1949-61.

==Biographies==
* In 1980, Haley began working on an autobiography entitled ''The Life and Times of Bill Haley'' but died after completing only 100 pages. The work is registered with the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] but has yet to be released to the public.
* In 1982, John Swenson wrote ''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'' (published in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] under the title, ''Bill Haley'').
* In 1990, Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley, along with John von Hoëlle wrote ''Sound and Glory'', a biography focusing mostly on Haley's early life and peak career years. This book is out of print.
* A [[German language|German]]-language biography was published soon after Haley's death, written by Peter Cornelsen and Harald D. Kain.
* A book on the history of Haley's most famous recording, ''Rock Around the Clock: The Record That Started the Rock Revolution'' by [[Jim Dawson]] was published in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra.html#clockbook Rockabillyhall.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film portrayals==
Unlike his contemporaries, Bill Haley has rarely been portrayed on screen. Following the success of ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' in 1978, Haley expressed interest in having his life story committed to film, but this never came to fruition. In the 1980s and early 1990s, numerous media reports emerged that plans were underway to do a biopic based upon Haley's life, with [[Beau Bridges]], [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[John Ritter]] all at one point being mentioned as actors in line to play Haley (according to ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine Magazine]]'', Ritter attempted to buy the film rights to ''Sound and Glory''). 

Bill Haley has also been portrayed - not always in a positive light - in several &quot;period&quot; films:
* John Paramor in ''[[Shout! The Story of Johnny O'Keefe]]'' (1985)
* Michael Daingerfield in ''[[Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story]]'' (1999)
* [[Dicky Barrett]] (of [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]) in ''[[Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story]]'' (also 1999)

In March 2005, the [[United Kingdom|British]] network [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]] reported that [[Tom Hanks]] was planning to produce a biopic on the life of Bill Haley, with production tentatively scheduled to begin in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sky.com/showbiz/picture_gallery/0,,50004-1175946-2,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However this rumor was quickly debunked by Hanks.

==Discography==

Prior to the formation of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, which later became The Comets, Haley released several singles with other groups. Dates are approximate due to lack of documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billhaleycentral.com Bill Haley Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

As '''Bill Haley and the Four Aces of Western Swing'''

1948
* Too Many Parties and Too Many Pals (vocal by Tex King)/Four Leaf Clover Blues ([[Cowboy Records|Cowboy]] CR1201)
1949
* Tennessee Border/Candy Kisses (Cowboy CR1202)

As '''Johnny Clifton and His String Band'''

1949 or 1950
* Stand Up and Be Counted/Loveless Blues ([[Center Records|Center]] C102)

Many Haley discographies list two 1946 recordings by the [[Down Homers]] released on the [[Vogue Records]] label as featuring Haley. Haley historian Chris Gardner, as well as surviving members of the group, have confirmed that the two singles: &quot;Out Where the West Winds Blow&quot;/&quot;Who's Gonna Kiss You When I'm Gone&quot; (Vogue R736) and &quot;Boogie Woogie Yodel&quot;/&quot;Baby I Found Out All About You&quot; (Vogue R786) do not feature Haley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegardnerfamily.org/haley/discography/recordings.html Thegardnerfamily.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tracks were nonetheless included in the compilation box set ''Rock 'n' Roll Arrives'' released by [[Bear Family Records]] in 2006.

:''See the discography section of [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] for a list of the singles and album releases made by Haley with the Saddlemen and the Comets from 1950 onwards.''

===Unreleased recordings===
Bill Haley recorded prolifically during the 1940s, often at the radio stations where he worked, or in formal studio settings. Virtually none of these recordings was ever released. Liner notes for a 2003 CD release by [[Hydra Records]] entitled ''Bill Haley and Friends Vol. 2: The Legendary Cowboy Recordings'' reveal that several additional Cowboy label single releases were planned for the Four Aces, but this never occurred. 

A number of previously unreleased Haley country-western recordings from the 1946-1950 period began to emerge near the end of Haley's life, some of which were released by the [[Arzee Records|Arzee]] label, with titles such as &quot;Yodel Your Blues Away&quot; and &quot;Rose of My Heart.&quot; Still more demos, alternate takes, and wholly unheard-before recordings have been released since Haley's death. Notable examples of such releases include the albums ''Golden Country Origins'' by [[Grassroots Records]] of [[Australia]] and ''Hillbilly Haley'' by the British label, [[Rollercoaster Records|Rollercoaster]], as well as the aforementioned German release by Hydra Records. In 2006, [[Bear Family Records]] of Germany released what is considered to be the most comprehensive (yet still incomplete) collection of Haley's 1946-1950 recordings as part of its Haley box set ''Rock n' Roll Arrives''.

The '''Northern Bobwhite''', '''Virginia Quail''' or (in its home range) '''Bobwhite Quail''' (''Colinus virginianus'') is a ground-dwelling [[bird]] native to the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean]]. It is a member of the group of species known as [[New World quail]]s (Odontophoridae).
They were initially placed with the Old World quails in the pheasant [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Phasianidae]]), but are not particularly closely related. The name &quot;[[Colinus|bobwhite]]&quot; derives from its characteristic whistling call. 
Despite its secretive nature, the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quail in eastern North America because it is frequently the only quail in its range. There are 22 subspecies of northern bobwhite, and many of the birds are hunted extensively as game birds.

==Appearance==
Bill: Short, curved, brown-black.&lt;br /&gt;
Size: 10&amp;nbsp;inches long with 15-inch wingspan, round body.&lt;br /&gt;
Colors: Brown, buff, rufous, white, black, gray.&lt;br /&gt;
Markings: Dimorphic species. Males have a white throat and brow stripe bordered by black. The overall rufous plumage has gray mottling on the wings and a gray tail, and the flanks show white scalloped stripes. Whitish underparts have black scallops. Females are similar but are duller overall and have a buff throat and brow without the black border. Both genders have pale legs and feet.

==Diet==
The Northern Bobwhite's diet consists of seeds, and insects that vary with the season.

==Habitat==
Northern bobwhites can be found year-round in agricultural fields, grassland, open woodland areas, roadsides and wood edges.. Their range covers the southeastern quadrant of the United States from the Great Lakes and southern Minnesota east to Pennsylvania and southern Massachusetts, and extending west to southern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and all but westernmost Texas. These birds are absent from the southern tip of Florida and the highest elevations of the Appalachian Mountains, but are found in eastern Mexico and in Cuba. Isolated populations of these game birds have been introduced in Oregon and Washington.

==Vocalizations==
The clear whistle &quot;bob-WHITE&quot; or &quot;bob-bob-WHITE&quot; call of these birds is most recognizable. The syllables are slow and widely spaced, rising in pitch a full octave from beginning to end. Other calls include lisps, peeps and more rapidly whistled warning calls.

==Behavior==
Like most game birds, the northern bobwhite is shy and elusive. When threatened, it will crouch and freeze, relying on camouflage to stay undetected, but will flush into low flight if closely disturbed. These birds are generally solitary or found in pairs early in the year, but family groups are common in the late summer and winter roosts may have two dozen or more birds in a single covey.

==Reproduction==
These are generally monogamous birds, though some evidence of polygamy has been noted. Both parents will incubate a brood for 23–24 days, and the precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching. Both parents will lead the young birds to food and care for them for 14–16 days until their first flight. These birds can raise 1-2 broods of 12-16 eggs per brood annually.

==Attracting Northern Bobwhites==
Game birds are not typical backyard birds, but in the appropriate habitat these birds will visit ground feeders for seeds or cracked corn. They will also visit ground-level bird baths. Birders who want to encourage northern bobwhites to visit should avoid insecticide sprays and choose low shrubs for landscaping to help the birds feel secure.

==Similar Species==
The [[Ruffed Grouse]] is larger with a fan-like tail.
