the writer of the best-selling [[Abarat]] series, and plans on producing three more novels in the series.

Barker's basic philosophy and approach are revealed clearly in his written foreword to H.R. Giger's illustrated work, &quot;Necronomicon.&quot;

==Film work==
Barker has a keen interest in movie production, although his films have received mixed receptions. He wrote the screenplays for ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]]'' (aka ''Transmutations'' – 1985) and ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), both directed by [[George Pavlou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|90233|Underworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), based on his novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]''. His early movies, the shorts ''The Forbidden'' and ''Salome'', are experimental art movies with surrealist elements, which have been re-released together to moderate critical acclaim. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (Cabal), which was widely considered to be a flop, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''. Barker was an executive producer of the film ''[[Gods and Monsters]]'', which received major critical acclaim. He had been working on a series of movie adaptations of his ''The Abarat Quintet'' books under Disney's management, but has admitted that because of creative differences, this project will not go ahead. He is developing a film based on his ''[[Tortured Souls]]'' line of toys from [[McFarlane Toys]].

In October 2006, Barker announced through his official website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original ''Hellraiser'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivebarker.info/intsrevel15.html The Official Clive Barker Resource – Revelations – Exclusive Interviews 15&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2994 Clive Barker remaking Hellraiser]'' – [[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]] news, 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A short story titled &quot;The Forbidden&quot;, from Barker's ''Books of Blood'', provided the basis for the film ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' and its two sequels.

Japanese director [[Ryuhei Kitamura]] directed the 2008 film ''[[Midnight Meat Train]]'' from [[Jeff Buhler]]'s screenplay based on Barker's short story of the same name for [[Lakeshore Entertainment]] and [[Lionsgate]].

In 2008, a movie was made from one of his &quot;Book of Blood&quot; short stories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.clivebarker.info/intsrevel19.html Revelations – official site interview]'' 7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Book of Blood (2008 film)|Clive Barker's Book of Blood]]'' was moderately well received, but was not very profitable.

In 2009 Barker's short story Dread (also from the Books of Blood) was made into a film and received good reviews. [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331307/ Dread (2009) on IMDb]

==Visual art and plays==
Barker is a prolific visual artist working in a variety of media, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, Dread, published by [[:it:Fantaco|Fantaco]] in the early Nineties, as well on the covers of the collections of his plays, ''Incarnations'' (1995) and ''Forms of Heaven'' (1996), as well as on the second printing of the original UK publications of his ''Books of Blood'' series. His artwork is currently exhibited at [http://www.bgfa.us/ Bert Green Fine Art] in Los Angeles, CA, and in the past has been shown at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection ''[[Clive Barker, Illustrator]]'', published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in Visions of Heaven and Hell, published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books. The most complete selection of Clive Barker's paintings and drawings are available to view in a gallery setting on the website [http://www.clivebarkerimaginer.com Clive Barker Imaginer.] Clive's official site has an [http://www.clivebarker.info/artindex.html extensive online gallery] of his artwork including exclusive sketches, the Imagining Man project and unpublished work-in-progress.
He worked on the creative side of a horror [[computer game]], ''[[Clive Barker's Undying]]'', providing the voice for the character Ambrose. ''Undying'' was developed by [[DreamWorks Interactive]] and released in 2001. Barker provided the artwork for his young adult novel ''[[The Thief of Always]]'' (1992) as well as the ''Abarat'' series. Barker announced in July 2006 that he has returned to the video game industry, working on ''[[Clive Barker's Jericho]]'' for [[Codemasters]] which was released in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&amp;aid=124325#962012 Clive Barker Returns To Games]'' – [[TotalGaming.net]] news, 19 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Barker created for Diguise Costumes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disguise.com/ Diguise Costumes – Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dark Bazaar a sortiment of [[Halloween]] costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35356/dress-up-like-clive-barkers-nightmares|title=Dress Up Like Clive Barker's Nightmares}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18723|title=Clive Barkers Enters the 'Dark Bizaar' with JAKKS Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==
A longtime comics fan, Barker achieved his dream of publishing his own superhero books when [[Marvel Comics]] launched the [[Razorline]] imprint in 1993. Based on detailed premises, titles and lead characters he created specifically for this, the four interrelated titles&amp;nbsp;— set outside the Marvel universe&amp;nbsp;— were ''[[Ectokid]]'' (written first by [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]], then by future ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' co-creator [[Wachowski brothers|Larry Wachowski]], with art by Steve Skroce), ''[[Hokum &amp; Hex]]'' (written by [[Frank Lovece]], art by [[Anthony Williams (comics)|Anthony Williams]]), ''[[Hyperkind]]'' (written by Fred Burke, art by Paris Cullins and Bob Petrecca) and ''[[Saint Sinner (comics)|Saint Sinner]]'' (written by [[Elaine Lee]], art by Max Douglas). A 2002 Barker telefilm titled ''Saint Sinner'' bore no relation to the comic.

Barker horror adaptations and spin-offs in comics include the Marvel/Epic series ''[[Hellraiser (comics)|Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Nightbreed (comics)|Nightbreed]]'', ''[[Pinhead (comics)|Pinhead]]'', ''The Harrowers'', ''Book of the Damned'' and ''Jihad''; [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse Books]]' series and [[graphic novels]] ''[[Tapping the Vein (comics)|Tapping The Vein]]'', ''Dread'', ''Son of Celluloid'', ''Revelations'' ''The Life of Death'', ''Rawhead Rex'' and ''The Yattering and Jack'', and [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Primal'', among others. Barker served as a consultant and wrote issues of the Hellraiser anthology comic book.

In 2005, IDW published a three-issue adaptation of Barker's children's fantasy novel ''[[The Thief of Always (comics)|The Thief of Always]]'', written and painted by Kris Oprisko and Gabriel Hernandez. IDW is publishing a 12 issue adaptation of Barker's novel ''[[The Great and Secret Show (comics)|The Great and Secret Show]]''.

In December 2007, Chris Ryall and Clive Barker announced an upcoming collaboration of an original comic book series, ''Torakator'', to be published by IDW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivebarker.info/newothersb.html The Official Clive Barker Resource – Revelations – Uncompleted Other Projects – B&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, IDW published ''Seduth'' (Written by Clive Barker and Chris Monfette; art by [[Gabriel Rodriguez]]; colors by Jay Fotos; letters by Neil Uyetake; edits by [[Chris Ryall]]; and 3-D conversion by [[Ray Zone]]), the first time Barker has created a world specifically for the comic book medium in two decades. The work was released with three variant covers; cover a featuring art by [[Gabriel Rodriguez]] and cover b with art by Clive Barker and the third is a &quot;retailer incentive signed edition cover&quot; with art by Clive Barker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/series/833 IDW Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
Barker has been openly [[homosexuality|homosexual]] since the early 1990s, first mentioning his dating life to US audiences in the pages of ''[[The Advocate]]'' magazine. He currently lives in [[Los Angeles]], CA, with his partner, photographer [[David Armstrong (photographer)|David Armstrong]] and Armstrong's daughter from a previous relationship, Nicole.

'''Comic fantasy''' is a subgenre of [[fantasy]] that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy.  It is sometimes known as [[Low fantasy]] in contrast to [[High fantasy]], which is primarily serious in intent and tone.  The term &quot;Low Fantasy&quot; is used to represent other types of fantasy, however, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature.

==History==
The subgenre rose in the latter half of the twentieth century.  [[T.H. White]]'s works exemplify it,&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 121–2. Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]]'s [[Harold Shea]] stories are early exemplars.  The overwhelming bulk of de Camp's fantasy was comic.&lt;ref&gt;Carter. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more modern times, [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Xanth]]'' books, [[Robert Asprin]]'s ''[[MythAdventures]]'' of Skeeve and Aahz books, [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'', [[Tom Holt]]'s books provide good examples, as do many of the works by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]].  Not surprisingly there are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including [[Chuck Whelon]]'s [[Pewfell]] series and the webcomics ''[[8-Bit Theater]]'' and ''[[The Order of the Stick]]''.

The subgenre has also been represented in [[Fantasy television|television]] and [[Fantasy film|film]], such as in the television series ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[Krod Mandoon]]'', and the 1975 film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.  Examples on radio are the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Hordes of the Things (radio series)|Hordes of the Things]]'', ''[[ElvenQuest]]'' and the original ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]''.

'''CLU''' is a [[programming language]] created at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] by [[Barbara Liskov]] and her students between 1974 and 1975. It was notable for its use of constructors for [[Abstract Data Type|abstract data types]] that included the code that operated on them, a key step in the direction of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP). However many of the other features of OOP are (intentionally) missing, notably inheritance, and the language is also hindered by a sometimes frustrating if elegant syntax.

== Clusters ==
The [[syntax]] of CLU was based on [[ALGOL]], then the starting point for most new language design. The key addition was the concept of a ''cluster'', CLU's type extension system and the root of the language's name (CLUster). Clusters correspond generally to the concept of an &quot;object&quot; in an OO language, and have roughly the same syntax. For instance, here is the CLU syntax for a cluster that implements [[complex number]]s:
&lt;!-- Not actually C, but this attribute is required--&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    complex_number = cluster is add, subtract, multiply, ...
        rep = record [ real_part: real, imag_part: real ]
        add = proc ... end add;
        subtract = proc ... end subtract;
        multiply = proc ... end multiply;
        ...
    end complex_number;&lt;/source &gt;

While clusters offered a then-advanced system for structuring programs, CLU did not offer any sort of structure for the clusters themselves. Cluster names are global, and no namespace mechanism was provided to group clusters or allow them to be created &quot;locally&quot; inside other clusters. This problem is not unique to CLU, but it is surprising that so many languages have lacked this feature — given the centralness in ALGOL of giving scope to variables, it seems that giving scope to cluster/object names would be an obvious extension.

CLU does not perform implicit type conversions. In a cluster, the explicit type conversions 'up' and 'down' change between the abstract type and the representation. There is a universal type 'any', and a procedure force[] to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being &quot;base types&quot; such as integers.

== Other features ==
Another key feature of the CLU type system are ''iterators'', which return objects from a collection one after the other. Iterators were &quot;black boxes&quot; that offered an identical [[application programming interface|API]] no matter what data they were being used with. Thus the iterator for a collection of &lt;code&gt;complex_number&lt;/code&gt;s would be identical to that for an array of &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;s. Iterators are now a common feature of most modern languages. ''(See [[Generator (computer science)|Generator]])''

CLU also includes [[exception handling]], based on various attempts in other languages; exceptions are raised using &lt;code&gt;signal&lt;/code&gt; and handled with &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt;. Oddly, given the focus on type design, CLU does not offer [[enumerated type]]s, nor any obvious way to create them.

A final distinctive feature in CLU is multiple assignment, where more than one variable can appear on the left hand side of an [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment operator]]. For instance, writing &lt;code&gt;x,y = y,x&lt;/code&gt; would exchange values of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. In the same way, functions could return several values, like &lt;code&gt;x,y,z = f(t)&lt;/code&gt;. 

All objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic.

== Influence on other programming languages ==
&lt;!-- this should probably be incorporated into the main article instead of having bullet points  --&gt;
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] borrowed several concepts from CLU (such as the ''yield'' statement and multiple assignment)
* CLU and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] were major inspirations for [[C++]] templates.
* CLU's exception handling mechanisms also influenced newer languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and C++.
* All objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic. These elements directly influenced Java.
* Python and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] include [[generator (computer science)|generator]]s (iterators in C#), which first appeared in CLU as iterators.
* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] took multiple assignment and multiple returns from function calls from CLU.

The '''history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991''', spans the period from [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|death and funeral]] until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Due to the years of [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet military]] buildup at the expense of domestic development, economic growth stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the [[Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] against the [[Soviet Union]]'s forces in the [[Soviet War in Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the [[Baltic republics]] and Eastern Europe. (Source: WorldBook online) 

Greater tits of political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], created an atmosphere of open criticism of the communist regime. The dramatic drop of the [[price of oil]] in 1985 and 1986, and consequent lack of [[foreign exchange reserves]] in following years to purchase grain profoundly influenced actions  of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name = 'AEI-Gaidar-Grain and Oil'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Tikhonov]], the [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], was succeeded by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and [[Vasili Kuznetsov (politician)|Vasili Kuznetsov]], the acting [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], was succeeded by [[Andrei Gromyko]], the former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

Several [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Socialist Republics]] began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government. The USSR's trade gap progressively emptied the coffers of the union, leading to eventual bankruptcy. The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple [[Perestroika|reform-minded]] Gorbachev.

==Leadership transition==
By 1982 the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the U.S. throughout the 1970s, but the system was so firmly entrenched that any real change seemed impossible. A huge rate of defense spending consumed large parts of the economy. The transition period that separated the Brezhnev and Gorbachev eras resembled the former much more than the latter, although hints of reform emerged as early as 1983.

===The Andropov interregnum===
Brezhnev died on November 10, 1982. Two days passed between his death and the announcement of the election of [[Yuri Andropov]] as the new [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary]], suggesting to many outsiders that a power struggle had occurred in the Kremlin. Once in power, however, Andropov wasted no time in promoting his supporters. In June 1983, he assumed the post of chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, thus becoming the ceremonial [[head of state]]. It had taken Brezhnev thirteen years to acquire this post. During his short rule, he replaced more than one-fifth of the Soviet ministers and regional party first secretaries and more than one-third of the department heads within the Central Committee apparatus. As a result, he replaced the aging leadership with younger, more dynamic administrators. But Andropov's ability to reshape the top leadership was constrained by his poor health and the influence of his rival [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who had previously supervised personnel matters in the Central Committee.

Andropov's domestic policy leaned heavily towards restoring discipline and order to Soviet society. He eschewed radical political and economic reforms, promoting instead a small degree of candor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to those that had been associated with Kosygin in the mid−1960s. In tandem with such economic experiments, Andropov launched an anti-corruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks. Unlike Brezhnev, who possessed several mansions and a fleet of luxury cars, he lived quite simply. His solution to the country's economic difficulties was basically for the people to work harder and show more discipline.

In foreign affairs, Andropov continued Brezhnev's policies. US−Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly beginning in March 1983, when US President [[Ronald Reagan]] dubbed the Soviet Union an &quot;[[evil empire]]&quot;. The official press agency TASS accused Reagan of &quot;thinking only in terms of confrontation and bellicose, lunatic anti-communism&quot;. Further deterioration occurred as a result of the Sept. 1, 1983 Soviet shooting  of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] near [[Moneron Island]] carrying 269 people including a sitting US congressman, [[Larry McDonald]], and over Reagan's stationing of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe.  In [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Nicaragua]] and elsewhere, under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the U.S. began undermining Soviet-supported governments by supplying arms to [[anti-communist]] resistance movements in these nations. 

Andropov's health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, becoming the first Soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that November.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. Did Andropov really not attend the November 7th, 1983 parade? There are some speculations that show he did attend|date=August 2009}} He died in February 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months. His most significant legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favours necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point, Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout Andropov's illness, Gorbachev's time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.

===The Chernenko interregnum===
At 72, [[Konstantin Chernenko]] was in poor health, suffering from emphysema, and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen, after lengthy discussion, to succeed Andropov. But Chernenko's short time in office did bring some significant policy changes. The personnel changes and investigations into [[political corruption|corruption]] undertaken under Andropov's tutelage came to an end. Chernenko advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture. He also called for a reduction in the CPSU's micromanagement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion. However, KGB repression of Soviet dissidents also increased.

Although Chernenko had called for renewed ''[[détente]]'' with the West, little progress was made towards closing the rift in East−West relations during his rule. The Soviet Union boycotted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], retaliating for the United States boycott of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]]. In the late summer of 1984, the Soviet Union also prevented a visit to [[West Germany]] by [[East Germany|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]]. Fighting in [[Afghanistan]] also intensified, but in the late autumn of 1984 the United States and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985.

The poor state of Chernenko's health made the question of succession an acute one. Chernenko gave Gorbachev high party positions that provided significant influence in the Politburo, and Gorbachev was able to gain the vital support of Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] in the struggle for succession. When Chernenko died in March 1985, Gorbachev assumed power unopposed.

==Rise of Gorbachev==
{{History of Russia|right}}The [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]], often referred to as the Soviet Union's &quot;Vietnam War&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamarov 1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Vladislav |last=Tamarov |title=Afghanistan: Soviet Vietnam |publisher=Mercury House |year=1992 |isbn=1-5627-9021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Vietnam War]]), led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. Also, the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 added motive force to Gorbachev's [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] reforms, which eventually spiraled out of control and caused the Soviet system to collapse.

== Changing of the guard ==

After years of stagnation, the &quot;new thinking&quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} of younger Communist [[apparatchik]]s began to emerge. Following the death of terminally ill [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the [[Politburo]] elected [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to the position of [[General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) in March 1985, marking the rise of a new generation of leadership. Under Gorbachev, relatively young, reform-oriented technocrats, who had begun their careers in the heyday of &quot;de−Stalinization&quot; under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (1958–1964), rapidly consolidated power within the CPSU, providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization, and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the West.

[[Nikolai Tikhonov]], the [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], was succeeded by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and [[Vasili Kuznetsov (politician)|Vasili Kuznetsov]], the acting [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], was succeeded by [[Andrei Gromyko]], the former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

[[Jimmy Carter]] had officially ended the policy of [[Détente]], by financially aiding [[President of Pakistan]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], who in turn put [[Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] in-charge of leading the war against the soviets by training and leading the anti−Soviet [[Mujahideen]] movement in neighboring [[Afghanistan]], which served as a pretext for the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]] six months later, with the aims of supporting the Afghan government, controlled by the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]]. Tensions between the superpowers increased during this time, when Carter placed trade embargoes on the Soviet Union and stated that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was &quot;the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;State of the Union Address, 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/speeches/su80jec.phtml |author=Carter, Jimmy |title=State of the Union Address, 1980 |publisher=Jimmy Carter Library and Museum|accessdate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

East-West tensions increased during the first term of U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–1985), reaching levels not seen since the 1962 [[Cuban missile crisis]] as Reagan increased US military spending to 7% of the GDP.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To match the USA's military buildup, the Soviet Union increased its own military spending to 27% of its GDP and froze production of civilian goods at 1980 levels, causing a sharp economic decline in the already failing Soviet economy. However, it is not clear where the number 27% of the GDP came from. This thesis is not confirmed by the extensive study on the causes of the dissolution of the Soviet Union by two prominent economists from the World Bank- [[William Easterly]] and [[Stanley Fisher]] from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “… the study concludes that the increased Soviet defense spending provoked by Mr. Reagan's policies was not the straw that broke the back of the Empire. The Afghan war and the Soviet response to Mr. Reagan's Star Wars program caused only a relatively small rise in defense costs. And the defense effort throughout the period from 1960 to 1987 contributed only marginally to economic decline.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/worldbusiness/17iht-think_2.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Many Can Learn From Soviet Downfall | first=Reginald | last=Dale | date=June 17, 1994 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, according to this thesis, major motivational factor for Gorbachev was his realization that the Soviet Union could not compete economically with the USA. However, if economic premises are taken into account, it is not clear why the Soviet leaders did not adopt the Chinese option - economic liberalization with preservation of political system. Instead Gorbachev chose political liberalization during the years leading to the collapse of the USSR, while not implementing any significant economic reforms. 

Pakistan's [[Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] was responsible for training, equipping and leading [[Mujaheddin]] forces against the [[Soviet Army]]. The Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence very efficiently fought the war and men like [[Akhtar Abdur Rahman]] and [[Hamid Gul]] were responsible for winning the war in Afghanistan. US President Reagan also actively hindered the Soviet Union's ability to sell natural gas to Europe whilst simultaneously actively working to keep gas prices low, which kept the price of Soviet oil low and further starved the Soviet Union of foreign capital.  This &quot;long-term strategic offensive,&quot; which &quot;contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of &quot;[[containment]]&quot;, accelerated the fall of the Soviet Union by encouraging it to overextend its economic base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm |title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan |publisher=Wais.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition that special operations by CIA in Saudi Arabia affected the prices of the Soviet oil was refuted by [[Marshall Goldman]]- eminent and one of the leading experts on the economy of the Soviet Union in his latest book. He pointed out that the Saudis decreased their production of oil in 1985 (it reached 16 year low), whereas the peak of production of oil was reached in 1980. They increased the production of oil in 1986, reduced it in 1987 with subsequent increase in 1988, but not to the levels of 1980 when the production reached the highest level. The real increase happened in 1990, by the time when the Cold War was almost over. In his book he asked the question if Saudi Arabia had such an effect on the Soviet oil prices why the prices did not fall in 1980 when the production of oil by Saudi Arabia reached the highest level- three times as much oil as in the middle of eighties and why the Saudis had been waiting till 1990 to increase their production -five years after CIA supposed intervention? Why the Soviet Union did not collapse in 1980 then? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bit8YHI8Hn0C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Marshall+Goldman+William+Casey+oil+USSR&amp;q |title=Petrostate: Putin, power, and the New Russia |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=49 |year=2008 |isbn=0195340736}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However this theory ignores the fact that the Soviet Union had already suffered several important setbacks during “reactive and defensive strategy” of “containment”. In 1972, Nixon normalized American relationship with China, thus creating pressure on the Soviet Union. Egyptian president Sadat in 1979 after signing of Camp David peace accord severed military and economic relations with the USSR (by that time the USSR provided a lot of assistance to Egypt and supported it in all its military operations against Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/sadat-and-nasser-13023 |title=Sadat and Nasser |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Gorbachev ushered in the process that would lead to the dismantling of the Soviet administrative [[command economy]] through his programs of ''[[glasnost]]'' (political openness), ''[[uskoreniye]]'' (speed-up of economic development) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (political and economic restructuring) announced in 1986, the Soviet economy suffered from both hidden [[inflation]] and pervasive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open [[black market]] that undermined the official economy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Additionally, the costs of superpower status—the military, space program, subsidies to client states—were out of proportion to the Soviet economy. The new wave of industrialization based upon information technology had left the Soviet Union desperate for Western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing [[backwardness]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Reforms===
[[Image:Soviet Union Administrative Divisions 1989.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet Union administrative divisions, 1989]]
The [[Law on Cooperatives]] enacted in May 1988 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene. 

''Glasnost'' resulted in greater freedom of speech and the press becoming far less controlled. Thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were also released.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Soviet social science became free to explore and publish on many subjects that had previously been off limits, including conducting public opinion polls. The All−Union Center for Public Opinion Research ([[VTsIOM|VCIOM]]) — the most prominent of several polling organizations that were started then — was opened. State archives became more accessible, and some social statistics that had been kept secret became open for research and publication on sensitive subjects such as income disparities, crime, suicide, abortion, and infant mortality. The first center for gender studies was opened within a newly formed Institute for the Socio−Economic Study of Human Population.

In January 1987, Gorbachev called for democratization: the infusion of democratic elements such as multi−candidate elections into the Soviet political process. A 1987 conference convened by Soviet economist and Gorbachev adviser [[Leonid Abalkin]], concluded: &quot;Deep transformations in the management of the economy cannot be realised without corresponding changes in the political system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Voprosy Ekonomiki'' (Moscow), no. 2 (1988), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 1988, at the CPSU's Nineteenth Party Conference,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. In December 1988, the Supreme Soviet approved the establishment of a [[Congress of People's Deputies]], which constitutional amendments had established as the Soviet Union's new legislative body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} 

[[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|Elections to the new Congress of People's Deputies]] were held throughout the USSR in March and April 1989. Gorbachev, as General Secretary of the Communist Party, could be forced to resign at any moment if the communist elite became dissatisfied with him. To proceed with reforms opposed by the majority of the communist party, Gorbachev aimed to consolidate power in a new position, [[President of the Soviet Union]], which was independent from the CPSU and the soviets (councils) and whose holder could be impeached only in case of direct violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/people/?pid=226 Российская история | Персонажи | Горбачев Михаил Сергеевич&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive president. At the same time, [[Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution|Article 6]] of the constitution was changed to deprive the CPSU of a monopoly on political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/spravka/20100314/213855855.html |title=Отмена 6-й статьи Конституции СССР о руководящей роли КПСС. Справка |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=14 March 2010|accessdate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintended consequences===
Gorbachev's efforts to streamline the Communist system offered promise, but ultimately proved uncontrollable and resulted in a cascade of events that eventually concluded with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initially intended as tools to bolster the Soviet economy, the policies of ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' soon led to unintended consequences. 

Relaxation under ''glasnost'' resulted in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the [[News media|media]]. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied and actively concealed. Problems receiving increased attention included poor housing, [[alcoholism]], [[drug abuse]], [[pollution]], outdated Stalin-era factories, and petty to large−scale corruption, all of which the official media had ignored. Media reports also exposed crimes committed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and the Soviet regime, such as the [[gulag]]s, [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|his treaty with Adolf Hitler]], and the [[Great Purges]], which had been ignored by the official media. Moreover, the ongoing [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]], and the mishandling of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], which Gorbachev tried to cover up, further damaged the credibility of the Soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing.

In all, the positive view of Soviet life long presented to the public by the official media was rapidly fading, and the negative aspects of life in the Soviet Union were brought into the spotlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy&quot;&gt;Acton, Edward,, (1995) ''Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy'', Longmann Group Ltd (1995) ISBN 0-582-08922-0&lt;/ref&gt; This undermined the faith of the public in the Soviet system and eroded the Communist Party's social power base, threatening the identity and integrity of the Soviet Union itself.

Fraying amongst the members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations and instability of its western allies, first indicated by [[Lech Wałęsa]]'s 1980 rise to leadership of the [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], accelerated, leaving the Soviet Union unable to depend upon its [[Eastern Europe]]an satellite states for protection as a buffer zone. By 1989, Moscow had repudiated the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non−intervention in the internal affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies. Gradually, each of the Warsaw Pact nations saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and, in the case of [[Romania]], a [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|violent uprising]]. By 1991 the communist governments of [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]], all of which had been imposed after [[World War II]], were brought down as [[Revolutions of 1989|revolution swept Eastern Europe]].
 
The Soviet Union also began experiencing upheaval as the political consequences of ''glasnost'' reverberated throughout the country. Despite efforts at containment, the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the USSR. In elections to the regional assemblies of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, [[nationalism|nationalists]] as well as radical reformers swept the board. As Gorbachev had weakened the system of internal political repression, the ability of the USSR's central Moscow government to impose its will on the USSR's constituent republics had been largely undermined. Massive peaceful protests in the [[Baltic Republics]] such as [[The Baltic Way]] and the [[Singing Revolution]] drew international attention and bolstered independence movements in various other regions.

The rise of nationalism under ''freedom of speech'' soon reawakened simmering ethnic tensions in various Soviet republics, further discrediting the ideal of a unified Soviet people. One instance occurred in February 1988, when the government in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a predominantly ethnic Armenian region in the [[Azerbaijan SSR]], passed a resolution calling for unification with the [[Armenian SSR]]. Violence against local Azerbaijanis was reported on Soviet television, provoking [[Sumgait pogrom|massacres of Armenians]] in the Azerbaijani city of [[Sumgait]].

Emboldened by the liberalized atmosphere of ''glasnost'', public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more overt than ever before in the Soviet period. Although ''perestroika'' was considered bold in the context of Soviet history, Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country's chronically sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms made some inroads in decentralization, but Gorbachev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the [[Stalinist]] system, including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production.

By 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. Tax revenues declined as republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The anti−alcohol campaign reduced tax revenues as well, which in 1982 accounted for about 12% of all state revenue. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supplier−producer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralization caused new production bottlenecks.

==Dissolution of the USSR==
{{Main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}

The '''dissolution of the Soviet Union''' was a process of systematic [[disintegration]], which occurs in [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economy]], social structure and [[Politics of the Soviet Union|political structure]]. It resulted in abolition of Soviet Federal Government (&quot;the Union centre&quot;) and independence of USSR's republic on 26 December 1991. The process was caused by weakening of the [[Soviet government]], which led to disentegration and took place from about 19 January 1990 to 31 December 1991. The process was characterized by many of the [[republics of the Soviet Union]] declaring their independence and being recognized [[Post-Soviet states|as sovereign nation-states]].

==Summary==
{{unreferenced-section|date=February 2011}}
The principal elements of the old Soviet political system were Communist Party dominance, the hierarchy of [[Soviet (council)|soviets]],  state [[socialism]], and  ethnic [[federation|federalism]]. Gorbachev's programs of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' produced radical unforeseen effects that brought that system down. As a means of reviving the Soviet state, Gorbachev repeatedly attempted to build a coalition of political leaders supportive of reform and created new arenas and bases of power. He implemented these measures because he wanted to resolve serious economic problems and political inertia that clearly threatened to put the Soviet Union into a state of long−term stagnation. 

But by using structural reforms to widen opportunities for leaders and popular movements in the union republics to gain influence, Gorbachev also made it possible for nationalist, orthodox communist, and populist forces to oppose his attempts to liberalize and revitalize Soviet communism. Although some of the new movements aspired to replace the Soviet system altogether with a liberal democratic one, others demanded independence for the national republics. Still others insisted on the restoration of the old Soviet ways. Ultimately, Gorbachev could not forge a compromise among these forces and the consequence was the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

==Post−Soviet restructuring==
{{Main|History of post-Soviet Russia}}
To restructure the Soviet administrative command system and implement transition to a [[market-based economy]], Yeltsin's [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock program]] was employed within days of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The subsidies to money-losing farms and industries were cut, price controls abolished, and the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] moved towards [[convertibility]]. New opportunities for Yeltsin's circle and other entrepreneurs to seize the former state property were created thus restructuring old state-owned economy within a few months. 

After obtaining power, the vast majority of &quot;idealistic&quot; reformers gained huge possessions of state property using their positions in the government and became [[business oligarch]]s in a manner that appeared antithetical to an emerging democracy. Existing institutions were conspicuously abandoned prior to the establishment of new legal structures of the market economy such as those governing private property, overseeing financial markets, and enforcing taxation.

Market economists believed that the dismantling of the administrative command system in Russia would raise [[GDP]] and living standards by allocating resources more efficiently. They also thought the collapse would create new production possibilities by eliminating central planning, substituting a decentralized market system, eliminating huge macroeconomic and structural distortions through liberalization, and providing incentives through privatization.

Since the USSR's collapse, Russia faced many problems that [[free market]] proponents in 1992 did not expect. Among other things, 25% of the population lived below the poverty line, life expectancy had fallen, birthrates were low, and the GDP was halved. These problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s, which nearly led to election of Yeltsin's Communist challenger, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]]. In the recent years, the economy of Russia has begun to improve greatly, due to major investments and business development and also due to high prices of natural resources.

'''Corsican''' ({{lang-co|corsu}} or ''lingua corsa'' is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken and written on the islands of [[Corsica]] ([[France]]) and northern [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]). Corsican is the traditional native language of the Corsican people, and was long the sole language of the island, which was acquired by France in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the (forced) use of French grew to the extent that, by the Liberation in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The twentieth century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1990, an estimated 50% of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a small minority, perhaps 10%, used Corsu as a first language.&lt;ref name=cif/&gt;

== Number of speakers ==
The January 2007 estimated population of the island was 281,000, while the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies - though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article - were performed, was about 261,000 (see under [[Corsica]]). Only a certain percentage of the population at either time spoke Corsu with any fluency. The 2001 population of 341,000 speakers on the island given by [[Ethnologue]]&lt;ref name=ethn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cos|title=Corsican|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; exceeds either census and thus may be considered questionable{{Or|date=May 2010}}, like its estimate of 402,000 speakers worldwide.

The use of Corsican over French has been declining. In 1980 about 70% of the population &quot;had some command of the Corsican language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corsican language use survey|url=http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=2008-06-13}} To find this statement and the supporting data click on List by languages, Corsican, Corsican language use survey and look under ''INTRODUCTION''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 out of a total population of about 254,000 the percentage had declined to 50%, with only 10% using it as a first language.&lt;ref name=cif/&gt; The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its non-supportive stand and began some strong measures to save it. Whether these measures will succeed remains to be seen. No recent statistics on Corsu are available.

[[UNESCO]] classifies the Corsican language as a ''potentially endangered language'', as it has &quot;a large number of children speakers&quot; but is &quot;without an official or prestigious status.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Red Book on Endagered Languages: Europe:|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_index.html|first=Tapani|last=Salminen|date=1993-1999|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification does not state that the language is currently endangered, only that it is potentially so. In fact it is being vigorously affirmed. Often acting according to the current long-standing sentiment unknown Corsicans cross out French roadway signs and paint in the Corsu names. The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in [[proverb]]s and in [[polyphony|polyphonic]] song.

== Governmental support ==
The 1991 &quot;Joxe Statute&quot;, in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [[Corsican Assembly]], and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsu. The [[University of Corsica Pascal Paoli]] at [[Corte]] took a central role in the planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insular Autonomy: A Framework for Conflict Settlement? A Comparative Study of Corsica and the Åland Islands|first=Farimah|last=Daftary|publisher=European Centre For Minority Issues (ECMI)|date=October 2000|url=http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_9.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2008-06-13|pages=pages 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the primary school level Corsu can be taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level, but is required at the University of Corsica. It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the Corsican Assembly advocates for its use; for example, on public signs.

== Sources ==
According to the anthropologist Dumenica Verdoni, writing new literature in modern Corsican, known as the ''Riacquistu'', is an integral part of affirming Corsican identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etat/identités:de la culture du conflit à la culture du projet|url=http://www.interromania.com/studii/sunta/verdoni/etats_identites.htm|first=Dumenica|last=Verdoni|publisher=Centru Culturale Universita di Corsica|work=InterRomania|accessdate=2008-06-17}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who had a notable career in France returned to Corsica to write in Corsican, such as the musical producers, Dumenicu Togniotti, director of the Teatru Paisanu, which produced polyphonic musicals, 1973–1982, followed in 1980 by Michel Raffaelli's Teatru di a Testa Mora, and Saveriu Valentini's Teatru Cupabbia in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=53|title=Music and Gender: Perspectives from the Mediterranean|first=Tullia|last=Magrini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226501663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of prose writers includes Alanu di Meglio, Ghjacumu Fusina, Lucia Santucci, Marcu Biancarelli,and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corsican Literature Today|first=Paul-Michel|last=Filippi|journal=Transcript|issue=17|year=2008|url=http://www.transcript-review.org/section.cfm?id=226&amp;lan=en|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mythology concerning the Corsican language is to some degree current{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} among foreigners, that it was a spoken language only or was only recently written. Omniglot goes so far as to assert &quot;Corsican first appeared in writing towards the end of the 19th century ....&quot;&lt;ref name=omni&gt;{{cite web|title=Corsican (corsu)|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/corsican.htm|publisher=Omniglot|date=1998-2008|first=Simon|last=Ager|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th and 18th century there was a steady stream of writers in Corsican, many of whom wrote also in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auteurs|url=http://www.adecec.net/adecec-net/Anthologie/liste.php?debut=0|publisher=ADECEC.net|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferdinand Gregorovius]], 19th century traveller and enthusiast of Corsican culture, reports that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the ''vocero'', a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 18th century Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=275–312|title=Corsica in Its Picturesque, Social, and Historical Aspects: the Records of a Tour in the Summer of 1852|first=Ferndinand|last=Gregorovius|authorlink=Ferdinand Gregorovius|coauthors=Russell Martineau (Translator)|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans|location=London|year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail of written popular literature of known date in Corsican currently goes no further back than the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Corsican Language|url=http://www.transcript-review.org/section.cfm?id=227&amp;lan=en|journal=Transcript|first=Francis (Translator)|last=Beretti|issue=17|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under ''External links'' below). Corsican has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on Corsica and many of the churchmen were [[Notary|notaries]].

Between 1200 and 1425 the monastery of [[Gorgona, Italy|Gorgona]], [[Benedictine]] for much of that time and in the territory of [[Pisa]], acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts written on Corsica. As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with Corsican ones there the legal language shows a transition from entirely [[Latin language|Latin]] through partially Latin, partially Corsican to entirely Corsican. The first known surviving document containing some Corsican is a bill of sale from [[Patrimonio]] dated to 1220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Silio P. P.|last=Scalfati|title=Latin et langue vernaculaire dans les actes notariés corses XIe-XVe siècle|pages=Section I|journal=Éditions en ligne de l'École des chartes|issue=7|year=2003|accessdate=2008-06-29|nopp=true}} {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were moved to Pisa before the monastery closed its doors and were published there.

Research into earlier evidence of Corsican is ongoing. It is entirely possible that archaeology or research in monastic archives will turn up more.

== Origins ==
The Corsican language has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the Medieval Italian powers: [[Tuscany]] (828-1077), [[Pisa]] (1077–1282) and [[Genoa]] (1282-1768), more recently by France (1768–present), which, since 1789, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term ''gallicised Corsican'' refers to Corsu up to about the year 1950. The term ''distanciated Corsican'' refers to an idealized Corsu from which various agents have succeeded in removing French or other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corsican distanciation strategies: Language purification or misguided attempts to reverse the gallicisation process?|first=Robert J.|last=Blackwood|journal=Multilingua - Journal of Cross-Cultural and Interlanguage Communication|volume=23|issue=3|pages=233–255|date=August 2004|format=pdf|url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/mult.2004.011?cookieSet=1|accessdate=2008-06-13|doi=10.1515/mult.2004.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general classification of Corsican as a Romance language allows two possibilities as to the identity of the speakers of the first distinct Corsican, or Proto-Corsican. They created the language either from Proto-Romance or from a subsequent Romance language.

In 40 AD neither a Romance nor an Italic language were spoken by the natives of Corsica. The Roman exile, [[Seneca the younger]], reports that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he did not understand (see under [[Prehistory of Corsica#Ligurian hypothesis|Prehistory of Corsica]]). Latin at that time was generally spoken only in the Roman colonies. There was probably a substratic language that is still visible in the toponymy or in some words, for instance Corsican (Gallurese) ''zerru'' 'pig'. The same is valid for [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]. The occupation of the island by [[Vandals]] about 469 AD marks the end of authoritative influence by Latin-speaking Romans (see under [[Medieval Corsica]]). If the natives of that time were speaking Latin they must have acquired it during the late empire. The documents of the early Christian church concerning Corsica are in Latin, but they are only communications between church officials (see under [[Ajaccio#History|Ajaccio]]).

The next window of opportunity for the predecessor of a Proto-Corsican was the administration of Corsica by [[Tuscany]], then speaking the [[Tuscan dialect]], an immediate predecessor of Italian. The first [[Italian language#History|Italian]] documents date from the 10th century but Italian must have developed earlier and Tuscan even earlier. Tuscan would have come from the latest phases of [[Vulgar Latin]]; Proto-Corsican from the Tuscan spoken on Corsica.

The last historical possibility is that Proto-Corsican came from the Tuscan dialect of [[Pisa]]; its period of Corsican administration, however, was relatively short. Genoese is not a likely possibility as Corsican is attested before the presence of [[Genoa]] on Corsica, and the linguistic features of Corsican do not match well with those of Genoese. Historical circumstances alone reduce the window of opportunity only to within several hundred years.

== Classification by subjective analysis ==
One of the main sources of confusion in popular classifications is the difference between a [[dialect]] and a [[language]]. Typically it is not possible to ascertain what an author means by these terms. For example, one might read that Corsican is a &quot;central southern [[Italian dialects|Italian dialect]]&quot; along with Tuscan, Campanian, Sicilian and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560079/italian_language.html|title=Italian Language|publisher=Encarta|accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwaudYBC|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it is &quot;closely related to the Tuscan dialect of Italian,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=52&amp;lang=en|title=Eurolang report on Corsican|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is generally understood that Italian is from Tuscan.

One of the characteristics of Tuscan and Italian is that Latin -''u''- in -''um'' becomes -''o'': ''annum'' &quot;year&quot; but Italian ''anno''. Corsican has ''annu'', retaining the -''u''. Or, the -''re'' infinitive ending as in Latin ''mittere'', &quot;send&quot;, is retained in Tuscan but lost in Corsican, which has ''mette''/''metta'', &quot;to put.&quot; The Latin relative pronoun, &quot;who,&quot; &quot;qui,&quot; &quot;quae,&quot; and &quot;what,&quot; &quot;quod,&quot; are [[inflected]] in Latin, while relative pronoun in Italian for &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; is &quot;che&quot; and in Corsican is uninflected ''chì.&quot;

== Dialects ==
The language has several dialects including Northern Corsican, spoken in the [[Bastia]] and [[Corte]] area, and Southern Corsican, spoken around [[Sartene]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]]. The dialect of [[Ajaccio]] has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] and [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]] are closer to the [[Genoa]] dialect, also known as [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]].

[[Image:Gallurese.png|right|thumb|250px|Languages in northern [[Sardinia]]]]
On [[Maddalena archipelago]] the local dialect (called ''Isulanu, Maddaleninu, Maddalenino'') was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio during immigration in the 17th-18th centuries. Though influenced by [[Gallurese]] it has maintained the original characteristics of Corsican. There are also numerous words of [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] and [[Ponza|Ponzese]] origin.&lt;ref name=ethn/&gt;

== Languages related to Corsican in Sardinia ==
{{Main|Gallurese|Sassarese language}}
[[Gallurese]] is spoken in the Sardinian region of [[Gallura]], including the archipelago of [[La Maddalena]]. [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]], is spoken in [[Sassari]] and in its neighbourhood, in the north-west of [[Sardinia]]. Whether these two languages should be included in the Corsican language as dialects, included in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] as dialects, or considered as independent languages, is debatable.

Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26, October 15, 1997, of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia grants &quot;''al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese''&quot; equal legal status with the other languages on [[Sardinia]]. They are being legally defined as different languages from [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] by the Sardinian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&amp;c=72&amp;s=1&amp;file=1997026|title= Legge Regionale 15 ottobre 1997, n. 26|accessdate=2008-06-16|author=Autonomous Region of Sardinia|date=1997-10-15|pages=Art. 2, paragraph 4}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alphabet ==
{{Main|Corsican alphabet}}
Corsican uses the [[Latin alphabet]] with some changes. Although the words written in it are close enough to [[Italian language|Italian]] and Latin for the non-Corsican speaker with a language background to follow, the pronunciation of those letters in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] or Italian is not a guide to the pronunciation of Corsican, which follows complex rules.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowel inventory ===
The grapheme &quot;i&quot; appears in some [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. &quot;I&quot; is not pronounced before a, o, u after sc, sg, c and g: ''sciarpa'' {{IPA|[ˈʃarpa]}}; or initially in some words: ''istu'' {{IPA|[ˈstu]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La prononciation des voyelles|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gbatti-alinguacorsa/|publisher=A Lingua Corsa|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels may be nasalized before n, which is assimilated to m before p or b, and the liquid consonant, gn. The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus n, m or gn. The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: ''pane'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpãnɛ]}} and not {{IPA|[ˈpanɛ]}}.

The vowel inventory, or collection of phonemic vowels (and the major allophones), transcribed in [[IPA]] symbols, is:&lt;ref name=omni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes sur la phonétique utilisée sur ce site|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gbatti-alinguacorsa/|publisher=A Lingua Corsa|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commodore''' is the commonly used name for '''Commodore Business Machines''' ('''CBM'''), the U.S.-based home computer manufacturer and [[electronics]] manufacturer headquartered in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], which also housed Commodore's corporate parent company, '''Commodore International Limited'''. Commodore played a vital role in the development of the [[home computer|home]]–[[personal computer]] industry in the 1980s. Commodore developed and marketed the world's best-selling desktop computer, the [[Commodore 64]] (1982). 

The company declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1994 and since then there have been several attempts to revive its [[Amiga]] systems. The brand revived in 2005 after a few mergers with Yeahronimo Media Ventures Inc., SATXS Communications BV, and Tulip Computers.

==History==
=== Founding and early years ===
[[Image:Commodore196x.svg|right|thumb|220px|Original Commodore logo: all-lowercase company name (1962&amp;ndash;1984).]]
[[Image:Commodore PR-100 3q.jpg|thumb|220px|Commodore PR-100 programmable calculator]]
The company that would become Commodore Business Machines, Inc. was founded in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=262677 |title=Commodore International B.V.: Private Company Information |publisher=Investing.businessweek.com |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Toronto as the '''Commodore Portable Typewriter Company''' by Polish immigrant and [[Auschwitz]] survivor [[Jack Tramiel]]. For a few years he had been living in New York, driving a taxicab and running a small business repairing typewriters, when he managed to sign a deal with a Czechoslovakian company to manufacture their designs in Canada. He moved to Toronto to start production. By the late 1950s a wave of Japanese machines forced most North American typewriter companies to cease business, but Tramiel instead turned to [[adding machine]]s.

In 1955, the company was formally incorporated as '''Commodore Business Machines, Inc.''' ('''CBM''') in Canada. In 1962, Commodore went public at New York stock exchange under the name of '''Commodore International Limited'''. In the late 1960s history repeated itself when Japanese firms started producing and exporting adding machines. The company's main investor and chairman, [[Irving Gould]], suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to understand how to compete. Instead, he returned with the new idea to produce electronic [[calculator]]s, which were just coming on the market.

Commodore soon had a profitable calculator line and was one of the more popular brands in the early 1970s, producing both consumer as well as scientific/programmable calculators. However, in 1975, [[Texas Instruments]], the main supplier of calculator parts, entered the market directly and put out a line of machines priced at less than Commodore's cost for the parts. Commodore had to be rescued once again by an infusion of cash from Gould, which Tramiel used beginning in 1976 to purchase several second-source chip suppliers, including [[MOS Technology|MOS Technology, Inc.]], in order to assure his supply. He agreed to buy MOS, which was having troubles of its own, only on the condition that its chip designer [[Chuck Peddle]] join Commodore directly as head of engineering.

In December 2007 when Tramiel was visiting the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]], for the 25th anniversary of the Commodore 64, he was asked why he called his company Commodore. He said: &quot;I wanted to call my company General, but there's so many Generals in the U.S.: [[General Electric]], [[General Motors]]. Then I went to Admiral, but that was taken. So I wind up in Berlin, Germany, with my wife, and we were in a cab, and the cab made a short stop, and in front of us was an [[Opel Commodore]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Software Development Times (January 1, 2008), Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Tramiel gave this account in many interviews, but Opel's Commodore didn't debut until 1967, years after the company had been named.&lt;ref&gt;Kretzinger, Boris: Commodore - Aufstieg und Fall eines Computerriesen, Morschen 2005, p. 14, Fn  18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Computers for the masses, not the classes&quot;===
[[Image:PET2001.jpg|right|thumb|Commodore PET 2001 (1977)]]
Once Chuck Peddle had taken over engineering at Commodore, he convinced Jack Tramiel that calculators were already a dead end and that they should turn their attention to [[home computer]]s. Peddle packaged his existing [[KIM-1]] [[single-board computer]] design in a metal case, along with a full-travel [[QWERTY]] keyboard, [[monochrome]] [[computer monitor|monitor]], and [[Datassette|tape recorder]] for program and data storage, to produce the [[Commodore PET]] (Personal Electronic Transactor). From PET's 1977 debut, Commodore would be a computer company.

Commodore had been reorganized the year before into '''Commodore International, Ltd.''', moving its financial headquarters to the [[Bahamas]] and its operational headquarters to [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], near to the MOS Technology site. The operational headquarters, where research and development of new products occurred, retained the name Commodore Business Machines, Inc.

The PET computer line was used primarily in schools, due to its tough all-metal construction (some models were labeled &quot;Teacher's PET&quot;), but did not compete well in the home setting where graphics and sound were important. This was addressed with the introduction of the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] in 1981, which was introduced at a cost of US$299 and sold in retail stores. Commodore took out aggressive ads featuring [[William Shatner]] asking consumers &quot;Why buy just a video game?&quot; The strategy worked and the VIC-20 became the first computer to ship more than one million units. A total of 2.5 million units were sold over the machine's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, Brian. ''On the Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore'', Variant Press. Page 221. ISBN 0-9738649-0-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Commodore64.jpg|275px|thumb|left|Commodore 64 (1982)]]

In 1982, Commodore introduced the [[Commodore 64]] as the successor to the VIC-20. Thanks to a well-designed set of [[integrated circuit|chips]] designed by MOS Technology, the Commodore 64, (also referred to as C64), possessed remarkable sound and graphics for its time and is often credited with starting the computer [[demo scene]]. Its US$595 price was high compared with that of the VIC-20, but it was still much less expensive than any other 64K computer on the market. Early C64 ads boasted, &quot;You can't buy a better computer at twice the price.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Australian ads used a tune speaking the words &quot;Are you keeping up with the commodore? Because the commodore is keeping up with you. &quot;

In 1983, Tramiel decided to focus on market share and cut the price of the VIC-20 and C64 dramatically, starting what would be called the &quot;home computer war.&quot; TI responded by cutting prices on its [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]], which had been introduced in 1981. Soon there was an all-out price war involving Commodore, TI, [[Atari]] and practically every vendor other than [[Apple Computer]]. By the end of this conflict, Commodore had shipped somewhere around 22 million C64s&amp;mdash;making the C64 the best selling computer of all time.

===Tramiel quits; The Amiga vs. ST battle===
[[Image:Commodore logo.svg|right|thumb|220px|Second Commodore logo, with mixed-case company name (1985&amp;ndash;1994).]]

Commodore's board of directors were as impacted as anyone else by the price spiral and decided they wanted out. An internal power struggle resulted; in January 1984, Tramiel resigned. He founded a new company, Tramel Technology (spelled differently so people would pronounce it correctly), and hired away a number of Commodore engineers to begin work on a next-generation computer design.

Now it was left to the remaining Commodore management to salvage the company's fortunes and plan for the future. It did so by buying a small startup company called [[Amiga Corporation]] in August 1984, for $25 million ($12.8 million in cash &amp; 550,000 in common shares) which became a subsidiary of Commodore, called Commodore-Amiga, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;David Needle. &quot;Special Report&quot; p.90 Personal Computing, (August 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Commodore brought this new [[32-bit]] computer design (initially codenamed &quot;Lorraine&quot;, later dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]) to market in the fall of 1985 for US $1295.

But Tramiel had beaten Commodore to the punch. His design was 95% completed by June (which fueled speculation that his engineers had taken technology with them from Commodore). In July 1984 he bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]] which allowed him to strike back and release the [[Atari ST]] earlier in 1985 for about $800.

During development in 1983, Amiga had exhausted venture capital and was desperate for more financing. [[Jay Miner]] and company had approached former employer [[Atari]], and the &quot;Warner owned&quot; Atari had paid Amiga to continue development work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOP SECRET: Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html|year=1983|month=November|work=Atari Historical Society|accessdate=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return Atari was to get one-year exclusive use of the design as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete Amiga computer. The Atari Museum has acquired the Atari-Amiga contract and Atari engineering logs revealing that the Atari Amiga was originally designated as the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named &quot;Mickey&quot;, and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed &quot;Minnie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html |title=&quot;Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement&quot; and &quot;Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor&quot; |publisher=Archives.atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Tramiel discovered that [[Warner Communications]] wanted to sell Atari, which was rumored to be losing about $10,000 a day. Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, he approached Atari and entered negotiations. After several on-again/off-again talks with Atari in May and June 1984, Tramiel had secured his funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July.

As more execs and researchers left Commodore after the announcement to join up with Tramiel's new company [[Atari Corp.]], Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets in late July. This was intended, in effect, to bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.

One of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff, and to cancel almost all ongoing projects, in order to review their continued viability. In late July/early August, Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract from the previous fall. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage, Tramiel immediately used the contract to counter-sue Commodore through its new subsidiary, Amiga, on August 13.

The Amiga crew, still suffering serious financial problems, had sought more monetary support from investors that entire spring. At around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari, Amiga entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore's intentions to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts - including Atari Inc.'s. This &quot;interpretation&quot; is what Tramiel used to counter-sue, and sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing any resembling technology. This was an attempt to render Commodore's new acquisition (and the source for its next generation of computers) useless. The resulting court case lasted for several years, with both companies releasing their respective products. By March 1987 they had settled out of court, with all suits against Tramiel's engineers dropped. His &quot;Business is War&quot; tactics had succeeded again.

[[Image:Amiga500 system1.jpg|270px|thumb|right|Amiga 500 (1987)]]

Throughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms, a ferocious Atari-Commodore rivalry raged. While this rivalry was in many ways a holdover from the days when the Commodore 64 had first challenged the Atari 800 (among others) in a series of scathing television commercials, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga only served to further alienate fans of each computer, who fought vitriolic [[Flame war#Holy wars|holy wars]] on the question of which platform was superior. This was reflected in sales numbers for the two platforms until the release of the [[Amiga 500]] in 1987 which led the Amiga sales to exceed the ST by about 1.5 to 1,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} despite reaching the market later. However, the battle was in vain, as neither platform captured a significant share of the world computer market and only the Apple Macintosh would survive the industry-wide shift to Microsoft Windows running on PC clones.

===Demise and bankruptcy===

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the computer press had often sought Commodore, one of the industry's leading players, and its colorful management for information, despite the company's notorious reputation. One columnist stated in April 1981 that &quot;the microcomputer industry abounds with horror stories describing the way Commodore treats its dealers and its customers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;osborne19810413&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=osborne&amp;f=false | title=The Portable Osborne | work=InfoWorld | accessdate=April 4, 2011 | author=Osborne, Adam | date=1981-04-13 | publisher=IDG | pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VIC-20 and C64, although aggressively marketed, were arguably more successful because of their price than their marketing. After Tramiel's departure, Commodore executives shied away from mass advertising and other marketing ploys, fearful of repeating past mistakes. Commodore also retreated from its earlier strategy of selling its computers to discount outlets and toy stores, and now favored authorized dealers.

By the late 1980s, the personal computer market had become dominated by the [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms. Commodore's marketing efforts for the Amiga were less competitive and seemed half-hearted and unfocused. The company also concentrated on consumer products that would not see a demand for another few years&amp;mdash;including a digital TV system called [[CDTV]].

In the early 1990s, CBM continued selling Amigas with 7&amp;ndash;14&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68000|68000]]-family CPUs (even though [[Amiga 3000]] with 25&amp;nbsp;MHz [[68030]] was in the market by that time), when PCs with 33&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Intel 80486|486]]s, high-color [[graphics card]]s and [[SoundBlaster]] (or compatible) [[sound card]]s offered comparable, and eventually higher, performance, albeit at higher prices. By way of contrast, when introduced in 1985, the Amiga had competed favorably against [[Intel 80286|286]]-based systems with [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics and rudimentary sound capabilities that frequently cost 2&amp;ndash;3 times as much.

In 1992, the production of the [[Amiga 600|A600]] seemed like a backward move; it replaced the [[Amiga 500|A500]], yet it removed the numeric keypad, Zorro expansion slot, SCSI capability, and other functionality in favor of PCMCIA and a theoretically cost-reduced design. It was basically unexpandable and lasted less than a year. Productivity developers moved to PC and Macintosh, while the console wars took over the gaming market. David Pleasance, managing director of Commodore UK, described the A600 as a 'complete and utter screw-up'. (Smith, 1994)

In late 1992, Amiga hardware began to reach parity with PCs with the release of the [[Amiga 4000|A4000]] and [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] computers, which featured an improved graphics chipset, the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]]. By this point, both the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh had a much larger market share than the Amiga platform. As software developers shifted to these platforms, the Amiga lost value for mainstream consumers. The custom-designed and custom-built AGA chipset also cost Commodore considerably more than the commodity chips used in IBM PCs, further reducing Commodore's profit margins. Common wisdom was that even though the AGA clearly improved upon the original chipset (OCS), it never returned to Amiga the clear dominance of multimedia computing that it once promised.

[[Copyright infringement of software|Software piracy]] has often been given by trade publications and user groups as the reason for the Amiga's demise, but this view is controversial{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. For information on the specific challenges in the Amiga market of the time, see the [[Amiga software#Piracy|Amiga Software]] article.

In 1994, the 'make or break' system, according to Pleasance, was the 32-bit [[CD-ROM]]-based [[game console]]: the [[Amiga CD32|CD32]], but it was not sufficiently profitable to put Commodore back in the black.

In the early 1990s, all servicing and warranty repairs were outsourced to [[Wang Laboratories]]. By 1994, only its operations in [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] were still profitable. Commodore declared bankruptcy on April 29, 1994, and its assets were liquidated. The former site of Commodore's operational headquarters in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], now houses the headquarters and broadcast studios of leading cable retailer [[QVC]], Inc. (On November 26, 2004, QVC became the first retailer to sell the [[C64 Direct-to-TV|DTV]], a &quot;C64 in a joystick&quot; designed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]].)

The company's computer systems, especially the C64 and Amiga series, retain a cult-following among their users years after its demise.

===Post-Commodore International, Ltd.===
Following its liquidation, Commodore's former assets went their separate ways, with none of the descendant companies repeating Commodore's early success.

{{Rquote|left|&quot;Commodore's high point was the Amiga 1000 (1985). The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody--including Commodore's marketing department--could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.&lt;br /&gt;--''[[Byte Magazine]],'' August 1994}}

Commodore UK was the only subsidiary to survive the bankruptcy and even placed a bid to buy out the rest of the operation, or at least the former parent company. For a time it was considered the front runner in the bid, and numerous reports (all false), surfaced during the 1994–1995 time frame that Commodore UK had made the purchase. Commodore UK stayed in business by selling old inventory and making computer speakers and some other types of computer peripherals. However, Commodore UK lost its financial backing after several larger companies, including [[Gateway Computers]] and [[Dell Inc.]], became interested, primarily for Commodore's 47 patents relating to the Amiga. Ultimately, the successful bidder was [[Germany|German]] PC conglomerate [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], and Commodore UK was absorbed into Escom in mid-1995.

Escom paid US$14 million for Commodore International, primarily for the Commodore brand name. It separated the Commodore and Amiga operations into separate divisions and quickly started using the brand name on a line of PCs sold in [[Europe]]. However, it soon started losing money due to over-expansion, went bankrupt on July 15, 1996, and was liquidated.

In September 1997, the Commodore brand name was acquired by Dutch computer maker [[Tulip Computers NV]]. Tulip's ownership was largely academic until July 11, 2003, when Tulip announced it would re-launch the Commodore name, including new Commodore 64-related products, and threatened legal action against commercial Web sites that used the computer's name without a license. On 18 June 2004, Tulip introduced the website [[CommodoreWorld]].com (see external links, below), run by its new daughter company '''[[Commodore International Corporation|Commodore International BV]]'''.

The Commodore brand name also resurfaced in late 2003 on an inexpensive portable [[MP3]] player made in the [[People's Republic of China]] by [[Tai Guen Enterprise]], sold mostly in [[Europe]]. However, the device's connection to Tulip, the legal owners of the name, is unclear.

In July 2004, Tulip announced a new series of products using the Commodore name: fPET, a flash memory-based USB Flash drive; mPET, a flash-based MP3 Player and digital recorder; eVIC, a 20 GB music player; and the [[C64 Direct-to-TV|C64 DTV]].

In late 2004, Tulip sold the Commodore name to [http://www.commodorecorp.com/corporate/the+company/01+About+CIC.aspx Yeahronimo Media Ventures] for €22 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.com/2004/12/29/tulip_sells_commodore/&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed in March 2005 after months of negotiations.

The Commodore Semiconductor Group (formerly MOS Technology, Inc.) was bought by its former management and in 1995, resumed operations under the name '''GMT Microelectronics''', utilizing a troubled facility in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]] that Commodore had closed in 1992. By 1999 it had $21 million in revenues and 183 employees. However, in 2001 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] shut the plant down. GMT ceased operations and was liquidated.

Ownership of the Amiga line passed through a few companies, from Escom of Germany in 1995, and then to U.S. PC clone maker [[Gateway Computers|Gateway]] in 1997, before an exclusive lifetime license was made to '''Amiga, Inc.''', a Washington company founded by former Gateway employees Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss in 2000. On March 15, 2004, Amiga, Inc. announced that on April 23, 2003 it had transferred its rights over past and future versions of the Amiga OS (but not over other intellectual property) to Itec, LLC, later acquired by KMOS, Inc., a Delaware company. On March 16, 2005, KMOS, Inc. announced that it had completed all registrations with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name to Amiga, Inc.

[[Commodore Gaming]] was formed to reintroduce the brand to the booming gaming PC market, after jointly acquiring the Commodore name with Commodore International Corporation in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgaming&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commodoregaming.com/pcshop/About+Commodore+gaming/About+Commodore+gaming.aspx |title=Who? |publisher=Commodore Gaming |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the CeBIT 2007 show in Germany, four new gaming geared PCs were introduced, named Cg, Cgs, Cgx and Cxx. These are described as ranging from an entry level gaming PC to an “extreme specification model”. Each x-86 machine has [[Microsoft Windows]] as the default operating system with customization from a range of high end components and peripherals. Production has ceased.

In 2010 [[Commodore USA]] launched as a start-up company that produced a replica of the Commodore 64 which it says will begin shipping in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/articles/229401217?cid=RSSfeed_IWK_All | title=Commodore 64 Replica Boasts Modern Components, Retro Look|date=2011-04-08|accessdate=2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodore USA also plan to bring back a range of high-end home theater PCs and workstations incorporating the Amiga brand in 2011. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} A Commodore Amiga 500 keyboard computer replica is also said to be in the design stage. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Commodore USA machines will run a custom Linux derivative called Commodore OS which is said to feature classic software emulation.

==Different Hardware And Operating System==

Since 2004, Commodore computers use [[Intel]] processors instead [[PowerPC]]. The main operating system used is [[Microsoft Windows]] with the only compatible Amiga-related operating system being [[AROS]]. The only PowerPC computers capable of booting [[Amiga OS]] and [[MorphOS]] that have been made are a limited product line consisting of [[AmigaOne X1000|Amigas]] and mostly Amiga Clones, such as those made by [[Genesi]], A-Eon, and A-Cube. Additionally, almost every recent Commodore computer uses a Microsoft Windows keyboard with the exception of [[prototypes]] with original Commodore and [[Amiga]] keyboards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Military ranks}}

'''Commodore''' is a [[military rank]] used in many [[navy|navies]] for officers whose position exceeds that of a navy [[Captain (Navy)|captain]], but is less than that of a [[rear admiral]]. Non English-speaking nations often use the rank of [[Flotilla Admiral]] or [[Counter Admiral]] instead (although the latter may also correspond to rear admiral).

It is often regarded as a [[1 star rank]] with a [[NATO]] code of [[OF-6]], but is not ''always'' regarded as a [[flag rank]].&lt;ref&gt;Whether &quot;commodore&quot; is a [[flag rank]] (or not) varies by country. Often, &quot;rear admiral&quot; is the first of the &quot;flag ranks&quot;. For example, it was not until 2001 that the UK made &quot;commodore&quot; a &quot;flag rank&quot;, and changed the shoulder rank insignia (although not the cuff rings) of the higher ranking admirals accordingly. Australia made this change in the mid-1990s, and also changed the commodore rank insignia to include a star.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is sometimes abbreviated as ''Cdre'', ''CDRE'' or ''COMO''.&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;Cdre&quot; abbreviation for the OF-6 rank of commodore is sometimes confused with the &quot;Cmdr&quot; abbreviation for the OF-4 rank of &quot;[[commander]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The rank of Commodore derives from the [[French language|French]] ''commandeur'', which was one of the highest ranks in orders of [[knight]]hood, and in military orders the title of the knight in charge of a ''commenda'' (a local part of the order's territorial possessions).

==History==
The [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] also used the rank of ''[[commandeur]]'' from the end of the 16th century for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in 1955. 
The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] has adopted the English spelling of ''Commodore'' for an equivalent rank.

The rank of Commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon Captains who commanded [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] of more than one vessel. In many navies, the rank of Commodore was merely viewed as a [[Senior Captain]] position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of Commodore the prestige of [[flag officer]] status - Commodore is the highest rank in the [[Irish Naval Service]], for example, and is held by only one person. In the Royal Navy, the position was introduced to combat the cost of appointing more Admirals - a costly business with a fleet as large as the Royal Navy's at that time.

==== United States ====
In 1899 the substantive rank of Commodore was discontinued in the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard]], but revived during World War II. It was discontinued as a rank in these services during the postwar period, but as an appointment, the title &quot;Commodore&quot; was then used to identify senior U.S. Navy [[captain (U.S. Navy)|Captain]]s who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel or functional air wings or air groups that were not part of a carrier air wing or air group. Concurrently, until the early 1980s, [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Coast Guard]] Captains selected for promotion to the rank of [[Rear Admiral]] (Lower Half), would wear the same insignia as Rear Admiral (Upper Half), i.e., two silver stars for collar insignia or sleeve braid of one wide and one narrow gold stripe, even though they were actually only equivalent to one star officers. 

To correct this inequity, the rank of Commodore as a single star Flag Officer was reinstated by both services in the early 1980s. This immediately caused confusion with those senior U.S. Navy Captains commanding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, functional air wings and air groups, and so on., who held the temporary &quot;title&quot; of Commodore. As a result of this confusion, the services soon renamed the new one star rank as Commodore Admiral (CADM) within the first six months following the rank's reintroduction. This was considered an awkward title and the rank was renamed a few months later to its current title of Rear Admiral (Lower Half), or RDML. 

The &quot;title&quot; of Commodore continues to be used in the U.S. Navy for those senior Captains in command of organizations consisting of groups of ships or submarines organized into [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]], air wings or air groups of [[Squadron (aviation)|aviation squadrons]] other than carrier air wings, special warfare ([[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]]) groups, and construction battalion ([[SeaBee]]) regiments. Although not Flag Officers, modern day Commodores in the U.S. Navy rate a blue and white command pennant that is normally flown at their headquarters facilities ashore or from ships they are embarked aboard.

===Argentina===
In the Argentine Navy,  the rank of commodore was created in the late 1990s, and is usually—but not always—issued to senior captains holding rear-admiral´s positions. Its equivalent in the Army is colonel-major, and has no equivalent in the Air Force. It´s usually—but incorrectly—referred to as &quot;Navy Commodore&quot;, to avoid confusion with the &quot;Air Force Commodore&quot;, which is equivalent to Navy´s Captain and Army´s Colonel.
The sleeve lace is identical to that of the Royal Navy, and wears one star on the shoulder strap.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Air force ranks==
Commodore, in Spanish ''Comodoro'', is a rank in the [[Argentine Air Force]]. This rank is the equivalent of a [[Colonel]] in the [[Argentine Army]], and a Colonel or [[Group Captain]] in other air forces of the world. The Argentine rank below Commodore is the rank of Vice-Commodore, in Spanish ''Vicecomodoro'', equivalent to a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the Argentine Army, and a Lieutenant-Colonel or [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] in other air forces.

Commodore is a rank in the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. It is a [[1 star rank]] and has essentially the same rank insignia as the British [[Air Commodore]].

Many air forces, use the rank of [[Air Commodore]]. This rank was first used by the [[Royal Air Force]] and is now used in many countries such as India, Australia, New Zealand, Greece, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Nigeria. It is the equivalent rank to the navy rank of &quot;commodore&quot;, and the army ranks of [[brigadier]] and [[brigadier general]].

The German air force used the concept of a unit Commodore, although this was a unit command appointment rather than a rank.

==Merchant and boating rank==
&lt;!-- An internal link from [[RMS Titanic]] is targeted to this section. Please change the link on that pageif you change the section name here! Thanks. --&gt;
Commodore is also a title held by the senior captain within a shipping company and by the senior officer of many yacht clubs and boating associations.

==Convoy commodore==

During wartime, a shipping [[convoy]] will have a ranking officer—sometimes an active-duty naval [[commissioned officer|officer]], at other times a [[civilian]] [[Master Mariner|master]] or retired naval officer—designated as the ''convoy commodore''. This title is not related to the individual{{'}}s military rank (if any), but instead is the title of the senior individual responsible for the overall operation of the [[merchant ship]]s and naval [[auxiliary ship]]s that make up the convoy. The convoy commodore does not command the convoy{{'}} escort forces (if any), which are commanded by a naval officer who serves as escort commander.

==Other uses==

In the [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary]], the senior elected officer of the organization is the National Commodore, also there are Commodores elected for the individual district commands of the Coast Guard Auxiliary. They hold the title of District Commodore. There are also appointed Commodores who are the senior office holder for the areas within the organizational directorate.  

In the [[Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary]] - PCGA , each of the directors in command of the 10 Coast Guard Auxiliary districts are Commodores, as well as most of the Deputy National Directors (some may be Rear Admirals - RADM). Commodore is appreviated to COMMO in the PCGA.

[[Vanderbilt University]]'s intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, a reference to [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]'s self-appointed title (he was the master of a large shipping fleet).

In the U.S. [[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]] program (which is part of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]), all National, Regional, Area, and Council committee chairs are titled as Commodore, while senior committee members are addressed as Vice Commodore. Ship Committee chairs do not hold this recognition.

      <comment>/* Complex differentiability */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Cauchy–Riemann differential equations''' in [[complex analysis]], named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Augustin Cauchy]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]], consist of a system of two [[partial differential equation]]s which must be satisfied in order for a [[differentiable function]] to be [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in an [[open set]] {{harv|Stewart &amp; Tall, p.70}}. This system of equations first appeared in the work of [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] {{harv|d'Alembert|1752}}. Later, [[Leonhard Euler]] connected this system to the [[analytic functions]] {{harv|Euler|1797}}. {{harvtxt|Cauchy|1814}} then used these equations to construct his theory of functions. Riemann's dissertation {{harv|Riemann|1851}} on the theory of functions appeared in 1851.

The Cauchy–Riemann equations on a pair of real-valued functions ''u''(''x'',''y'') and ''v''(''x'',''y'') are the two equations:

:(1a){{quad}} &lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial x } = { \partial v \over \partial y } &lt;/math&gt;

and

:(1b){{quad}}&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial y } = -{ \partial v \over \partial x } &lt;/math&gt;

Typically ''u'' and ''v'' are taken to be the [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s respectively of a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function ''f''(''x'' + i''y'') = ''u''(''x'',''y'') + i''v''(''x'',''y'').  Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' are [[continuously differentiable]] on an [[open subset]] of '''C'''.  Then ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''+i''v'' is [[holomorphic]] if and only if the partial derivatives of ''u'' and ''v'' exist, are [[Continuous function|continuous]], and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations (1a) and (1b).

== Interpretation and reformulation ==

The equations are one way of looking at the condition on a function to be differentiable (holomorphic) in the sense of [[complex analysis]]: in other words they encapsulate the notion of [[function of a complex variable]] by means of conventional [[differential calculus]]. In the theory there are several other major ways of looking at this notion, and the translation of the condition into other language is often needed.

=== Conformal mappings ===
First, the Cauchy–Riemann equations may be written in complex form

:(2){{quad}}&lt;math&gt;{ i { \partial f \over \partial x } } = { \partial f \over \partial y } . &lt;/math&gt;

In this form, the equations correspond structurally to the condition that the [[Jacobian matrix]] is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  a &amp;   -b  \\
  b &amp; \;\; a  
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a=\partial u/\partial x=\partial v/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b=\partial v/\partial x=-\partial u/\partial y&lt;/math&gt;.  A matrix of this form is the [[Complex number#Matrix representation of complex numbers|matrix representation of a complex number]]. Geometrically, such a matrix is always the [[function composition|composition]] of a [[rotation]] with a [[homothety|scaling]], and in particular preserves [[angle]]s. Consequently, a function satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations, with a nonzero derivative, preserves the angle between curves in the plane.  That is, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are the conditions for a function to be [[conformal map|conformal]].

=== Complex differentiability ===
Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = u(z) + i v(z)\,&lt;/math&gt;

is a function of a complex number ''z''.  Then the complex derivative of ''ƒ'' at a point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\underset{h\in\mathbb{C}}{h\to 0}} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = f'(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;

provided this limit exists.

If this limit exists, then it may be computed by taking the limit as ''h''&amp;nbsp;→ 0 along the real axis or imaginary axis; in either case it should give the same result.  Approaching along the real axis, one finds

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\underset{h\in\mathbb{R}}{h\to 0}} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z_0).&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, approaching along the imaginary axis,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\underset{h\in \mathbb{R}}{h\to 0}} \frac{f(z_0+ih)-f(z_0)}{ih} =
\lim_{\underset{h\in \mathbb{R}}{h\to 0}} -i\frac{f(z_0+ih)-f(z_0)}{h} =-i\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z_0).&lt;/math&gt;

The equality of the derivative of ''ƒ'' taken along the two axes is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z_0)=-i\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z_0),&lt;/math&gt;

which are the Cauchy–Riemann equations (2) at the point&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conversely, if ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: '''C'''&amp;nbsp;→ '''C''' is a function which is differentiable when regarded as a function on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''ƒ'' is complex differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold.

Indeed, following {{harvtxt|Rudin|1966}}, suppose ''ƒ'' is a complex function defined in an open set Ω&amp;nbsp;⊂ '''C'''.  Then, writing {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + i ''y''{{nowrap end}} for every ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈ Ω, one can also regard Ω as an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''ƒ'' as a function of two real variables ''x'' and ''y'', which maps Ω&amp;nbsp;⊂  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''C'''.  We consider the Cauchy–Riemann equations at ''z''&amp;nbsp;= 0 assuming ''ƒ''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;= 0, just for notational simplicity &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;the proof is identical in general case.  So assume ''ƒ'' is differentiable at 0, as a function of two real variables from Ω to '''C'''.  This is equivalent to the existence of two complex numbers &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; (which are the partial derivatives of ''ƒ'') such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(z) = \alpha x + \beta y + \eta(z)z \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; z=x+iy &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \eta(z) \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; z \rightarrow z_0 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;  Since &lt;math&gt; z+\bar{z}=2x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z-\bar{z}=2iy &lt;/math&gt;, the above can be re-written as

:&lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{\alpha - i\beta}{2}z + \frac{\alpha + i\beta}{2}\bar{z} + \eta(z) z\, &lt;/math&gt;

Defining the two [[Wirtinger derivatives]] as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2} \Bigl( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigr), \;\;\; \frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}}= \frac{1}{2} \Bigl( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigr),&lt;/math&gt;

the above equality can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{f(z)}{z} =\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right)(0) + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}}\right)(0) \cdot \frac{\bar{z}}{z} + \eta(z), \;\;\;\;(z \neq 0). &lt;/math&gt;

For real values of &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; \bar{z}/z = 1&lt;/math&gt; and for purely imaginary &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; \bar{z}/z = -1 &lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;math&gt; f(z)/z &lt;/math&gt; has a limit at 0 (''i.e.'', ''ƒ'' is complex differentiable at 0)  if and only if &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle (\partial f/\partial\bar{z})(0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  But this is exactly the Cauchy–Riemann equations, thus ''ƒ'' is analytic at 0 if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold at&amp;nbsp;0.

=== Independence of the complex conjugate ===

The above proof suggests another interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations.  The [[complex conjugate]] of ''z'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x + iy} := x - iy&lt;/math&gt;
for real ''x'' and ''y''. The Cauchy–Riemann equations can then be written as a single equation

:(3){{quad}}&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

by using the [[Wirtinger derivatives|Wirtinger derivative respect to the conjugate variable]]. In this form, the Cauchy–Riemann equations can be interpreted as the statement that ''f'' is independent of the variable &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;. As such, we can view analytic functions as true functions of ''one'' complex variable as opposed to complex functions of ''two'' real variables.

=== Physical interpretation ===
One interpretation of the Cauchy-Riemann equations {{harv|Pólya|Szegö|1978}} does not involve complex variables directly.  Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations in an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and consider the [[vector field]]

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f} = \begin{bmatrix}u\\ -v\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

regarded as a (real) two-component vector.  Then the second Cauchy-Riemann equation (1b) asserts that &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; is [[irrotational vector field|irrotational]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial (-v)}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The first Cauchy-Riemann equation (1a) asserts that the vector field is [[solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] (or [[divergence]]-free):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (-v)}{\partial y}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Owing respectively to [[Green's theorem]] and the [[divergence theorem]], such a field is necessarily [[conservative vector field|conserved]] and free from sources or sinks, having net flux equal to zero through any open domain.  (These two observations combine as real and imaginary parts in [[Cauchy's integral theorem]].) In [[fluid dynamics]], such a vector field is a [[potential flow]] {{harv|Chanson|2000}}.  In [[magnetostatics]], such vector fields model static [[magnetic field]]s on a region of the plane containing no current.  In [[electrostatics]], they model static electric fields in a region of the plane containing no electric charge.

=== Other representations ===
Other representations of the Cauchy–Riemann equations occasionally arise in other [[coordinate system]]s.  If (1a) and (1b) hold for a continuously differentiable pair of functions ''u'' and ''v'', then so do

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial s},\quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial n} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}&lt;/math&gt;

for any coordinate system {{nowrap|(''n''(''x'', ''y''), ''s''(''x'', ''y''))}} such that the pair &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (\nabla n, \nabla s)&lt;/math&gt; is [[orthonormal]] and [[orientation (mathematics)|positively oriented]].  As a consequence, in particular,  in the system of coordinates given by the polar representation {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''r''&amp;thinsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;i''&amp;theta;''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the equations then take the form

:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial r } = {1 \over r}{ \partial v \over \partial \theta},\quad{ \partial v \over \partial r } = -{1 \over r}{ \partial u \over \partial \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these into one equation for ''ƒ'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial r} = {1 \over i r}{\partial f \over \partial \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Inhomogeneous equations==

The inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations consist of the two equations for a pair of unknown functions ''u''(''x'',''y'') and ''v''(''x'',''y'') of two real variables

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \alpha(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = \beta(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some given functions α(''x'',''y'') and β(''x'',''y'') defined in an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  These equations are usually combined into a single equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}} = \phi(z,\bar{z})&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' = ''u'' + i''v'' and φ = (α + iβ)/2.

If φ is [[continuously differentiable|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;]], then the inhomogeneous equation is explicitly solvable in any bounded domain ''D'', provided ''φ'' is continuous on the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''D''.  Indeed, by the [[Cauchy integral formula]],

:&lt;math&gt;f(\zeta,\bar{\zeta}) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\iint_D \phi(z,\bar{z})\frac{dz\wedge d\bar{z}}{z-\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''ζ'' ∈ ''D''.

==Generalizations==
=== Goursat's theorem and its generalizations ===
{{see also|Cauchy–Goursat theorem}}

Suppose that {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' {{=}} ''u''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;i''v''}} is a complex-valued function which is [[Fréchet derivative|differentiable]] as a function {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Then '''Goursat's theorem''' asserts that ''ƒ'' is analytic in an open complex domain Ω if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equation in the domain {{harv|Rudin|1966|loc=Theorem 11.2}}. In particular, continuous differentiability of ''ƒ'' need not be assumed {{harv|Dieudonné|1969|loc=§9.10, Ex. 1}}.

The hypotheses of Goursat's theorem can be weakened significantly.  If {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' {{=}} ''u''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;i''v''}} is continuous in an open set Ω and the [[partial derivative]]s of ''ƒ'' with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' exist in Ω, and satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations throughout Ω, then ''ƒ'' is holomorphic (and thus analytic).  This result is the [[Looman–Menchoff theorem]].

The hypothesis that ''ƒ'' obey the Cauchy–Riemann equations throughout the domain Ω is essential.  It is possible to construct a continuous function satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations at a point, but which is not analytic at the point (e.g., ''ƒ''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;{{!}}z{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.  Similarly, some additional assumption is needed besides the Cauchy–Riemann equations (such as continuity), as the following example illustrates {{harv|Looman|1923|p=107}}

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \begin{cases}\exp(-z^{-4})&amp;\mathrm{if\ }z\not=0\\
0&amp;\mathrm{if\ }z=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations everywhere, but fails to be continuous at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Nevertheless, if a function satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations in an open set in a [[weak derivative|weak sense]], then the function is analytic.  More precisely {{harv|Gray|Morris|1978|loc=Theorem 9}}:
* If ''ƒ''(''z'') is locally integrable in an open domain Ω&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;'''C''', and satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations weakly, then ''ƒ'' agrees [[almost everywhere]] with an analytic function in Ω.
This is in fact a special case of a more general result on the regularity of solutions of [[hypoelliptic operator|hypoelliptic]] partial differential equations.

===Several variables===
There are Cauchy–Riemann equations, appropriately generalized, in the theory of [[several complex variables]]. They form a significant [[overdetermined system]] of PDEs. As often formulated, the ''[[d-bar operator]]'' 

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;

annihilates holomorphic functions. This generalizes most directly the formulation

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = {1 \over 2}\left({\partial f \over \partial x} + i{\partial f \over \partial y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bäcklund transform ===
Viewed as [[conjugate harmonic functions]], the Cauchy–Riemann equations are a simple example of a [[Bäcklund transform]]. More complicated, generally non-linear Bäcklund transforms, such as in the [[sine-Gordon equation]], are of great interest in the theory of [[soliton]]s and [[integrable system]]s.

'''Chaim Topol''' ({{lang-he|'''חיים טופול'''}}; born September 9, 1935), often billed simply as '''Topol''', is an [[Israel]]i [[theater|theatrical]] and [[film]] performer.

==Early life==
Topol was born in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1935 in what was then the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], to Rel (née Goldman) and Jacob Topol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/86/Topol.html|title=Topol Film Reference biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first practiced acting in amateur theatrical plays staged by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Army]]. Subsequently he established his own theatre troupe in Tel Aviv, and in 1961, he significantly contributed to the foundation of the [[Haifa Theatre|Haifa Municipal Theatre]].

==Acting career==
Among Topol's earliest film appearances was the lead role in the 1964 film ''[[Sallah Shabati]]'' by [[Ephraim Kishon]] &amp;mdash; a play, later adapted for film, depicting the hardships of a [[Mizrahi Jew|Mizrachi Jewish]] immigrant family in Israel of the early 1960s. The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and earned the actor the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor]]. In 1966, Topol made his first [[English language|English-language]] screen appearance as Abou Ibn Kaqden in the big-budget [[Mickey Marcus]] biopic ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]''.

He came to greatest prominence in the role of [[Tevye]] the milkman in the long-running musical show ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_f/fiddler_on_the_roof.htm ''Fiddler On The Roof'' (The Guide to Musical Theatre)]. Retrieved 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring a major success on the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage, he later starred in the 1971 [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|film version]].  

In 1972, Topol won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for his performance in the film. He was on active service with the [[Israeli Army]] at the time, but was granted permission to attend the awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omanoot.com/Artist-175,1257-Chaim-Topol.aspx Topol's Biography at Omanoot]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, Topol originated the leading role of the baker, Aimable, in the new musical &quot;[[The Baker's Wife]]&quot;, but was fired after eight months by producer [[David Merrick]]. In her autobiography, &quot;[[Patti LuPone]]: A Memoir&quot;, his co-star in the production relayed that Topol behaved unprofessionally in front of paying audiences, sometimes speaking gibberish instead of his lines, and other times responding to the director's instructions by grossly overacting on purpose. Her account was echoed by the show's composer, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], in the book &quot;Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, From Godspell to Wicked&quot;, in which he claimed that Topol's unprofessional behavior greatly disturbed the cast and directors and resulted in the production not reaching Broadway as planned.

Some of Topol's other notable appearances were in ''[[Galileo (film)|Galileo]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]), ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), and as [[Milos Columbo]] in [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' ([[1981 in film|1981]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082398/ ''For Your Eyes Only'' film profile at IMDb website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he reprised the role of Tevye in a London revival of ''Fiddler on the Roof''. In the late 1980s, he played the role in a touring United States production. He was by now the approximate age of the character, and in fact the actress playing his wife Golde in the production, [[Rosalind Harris]], had played his oldest daughter Tzeitel in the film. In 1990, he again played the part in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''Fiddler'', and was nominated for 1991 a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]], losing to [[Jonathan Pryce]]. He played the part again in a 1994 London revival, which became a touring production. He has since played the part in various productions including stages in [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]. His most recent film roles were in ''[[Left Luggage (film)|Left Luggage]]'' (1998) in the role of Mr. Apfelschnitt, and ''Time Elevator'' (1998) as Shalem.

In November 2005, Topol had a two month season once again playing [[Tevye]] in [[Fiddler On the Roof]] at [[Capitol Theatre]] in [[Sydney, Australia]] and in April 2007, played the role in [[Wellington, New Zealand]]. In September 2008, Topol played the part of Honore in [[Gigi]] at the [[Open Air Theatre]] in [[Regent's Park]], London.

On January 20, 2009, Topol began a farewell tour of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' as Tevye, opening in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. He was forced to withdraw from the tour due to a shoulder injury and made his last appearance as Tevye in Boston, Massachusetts on November 15, 2009.  ([[Theodore Bikel]] and [[Harvey Fierstein]], both of whom have portrayed Tevye on Broadway, replaced him in scheduled appearances.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Propst|first=Andy|url=http://www.theatermania.com/touring-productions/news/11-2009/harvey-fierstein-replaces-topol-in-fiddler-on-the_22808.html|title=Harvey Fierstein Replaces Topol in Fiddler on the Roof Tour: Theater News on TheaterMania.com - 11/11/2009|publisher=Theatermania.com|date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
His autobiography, ''Chaim Topol on Topol'', was published in London and Israel.

Topol is also an illustrator, responsible for drawings in several books, including ''A Treasury of [[Jewish humour]]''.

== History ==
=== Nineteenth century ===
The Christadelphian religious group traces its origins to Dr [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]] (1805–1871), who migrated to America from England in 1832.  Following a near shipwreck he vowed to find out the truth about life and God through personal Biblical study.  Initially he sought to avoid the kind of [[sectarianism]] he had seen in England.  In this he found sympathy with the rapidly emerging [[Restoration Movement]] in America at the time.  This movement sought for a reform based upon the [[Sola scriptura|Bible alone]] as a sufficient guide and rejected all [[creed]]s. However this liberality eventually led to dissent as John Thomas developed in his personal beliefs and started to question mainstream orthodox Christian beliefs.  Whilst the Restoration Movement accepted Thomas's right to have his own beliefs, when he started preaching that they were essential to salvation, it led to a fierce series of debates with a notable leader of the movement, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]].  John Thomas believed that scripture, as God's word, did not support a multiplicity of differing beliefs, and challenged the leaders to continue with the process of restoring 1st-century Christian beliefs and correct interpretation through a process of debate.  The history of this process appears in the book ''Dr. Thomas, His Life and Work'' (1873) by a Christadelphian, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;Available online http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/Bereans/Cornerstones/Pioneers/Life/toc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of formulating his ideas he was baptised twice,&lt;ref&gt;John Thomas was baptised by Walter Scott of the Disciples of Christ in 1832 and again in 1847 (probably by John Tomline Walsh, according to Peter Hemingray ''John Thomas—His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p.145) after publishing ''A Confession and Abjuration'' in which he renounced previously held beliefs as false.&lt;/ref&gt; the second time after renouncing the beliefs he previously held. His new position was based on a new appreciation for the reign of Christ on David's throne.&lt;ref&gt;Available [http://www.antipas.org/books/faith_in_last_days/fld_014.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; It was this abjuration of his former beliefs that eventually led to the Restoration Movement disfellowshipping him when he toured England and they became aware of his abjuration in America.

The Christadelphian community in Britain effectively dates from Thomas's first lecturing tour (May 1848 – October 1850). His message was particularly well received in Scotland, and [[Campbellite]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Adventist]] friends separated to form groups of &quot;Baptised Believers&quot;. Two thirds of ecclesias, and members, in Britain before 1864 were in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, AB op cit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Christmas. The Christadelphian 1956–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norrie, William &quot;Early History of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God in Britain&quot; Earlston 1904&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, during his tour of Britain he completed (a decade and a half before the name ''Christadelphian'' was conceived) ''[[Elpis Israel]]''&lt;ref&gt;John Thomas, ''Elpis Israel: an exposition of the Kingdom of God with reference to the time of the end and the age to come'' (London: 1849). Available [http://www.thechristadelphian.com/books/readonline/elpisisrael/default.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; (''elpis'' being Greek for &quot;hope&quot;) – in which he laid out his understanding of the main doctrines of the Bible.{{wikisource|Elpis Israel}} Since his medium for bringing change was print and debate, it was natural for the origins of the Christadelphian body to be associated with journals and books, namely the ''Herald of the Kingdom'' and ''The Ambassador'' (which later became ''[[The Christadelphian]]''). 

In this desire to seek to establish Biblical truth and test out orthodox Christian beliefs through independent scriptural study he was not alone and, amongst other churches, he also had links with [[Adventist]] movement and with [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] (who later set up the [[Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith]] in the 1860s).

Although the Christadelphian movement originated through the activities of John Thomas, he never saw himself as setting up disciples. Rather he believed he had rediscovered 1st-century beliefs and sought to prove that through a process of challenge and debate and writing journals. Through that process a number of people were convinced and set up various fellowships that had sympathy with that position. Groups associated with John Thomas met under various names, including Believers, Baptised Believers, the Royal Association of Believers, Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God, Nazarines (or Nazarenes) and The Antipas&lt;ref name = &quot;anrvrv&quot;/&gt; until the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). At that time, church affiliation was required{{where?}} to register for [[conscientious objector|conscientious-objector]] status, and in 1865 Thomas chose for registration purposes the name ''Christadelphian''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas preferred the name ''Brethren in Christ'', but settled on ''Christadelphian''. He once wrote in a letter, &quot;I did not know a better denomination that would be given to such a class of believers, than ''Brethren in Christ''. This declares their true status; and, as officials prefer words to phrases, the same fact expressed in another form by the word Christadelphians, or ''Christou Adelphoi'', Christ's Brethren. This matter settled to their satisfaction ... &quot; ({{cite journal | last = Carter | first= John | title = Our Name | journal = The Christadelphian | volume = 92 | page = 181 | month = May | year = 1955}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the teaching of John Thomas and the need in the American civil war for a name, the Christadelphians emerged as a denomination, but they were formed into a lasting structure through a passionate follower of his interpretation of the Bible, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]]. At the age of 10 he was taken by his mother to hear a talk given by John Thomas in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]]. At the age of 13 he read Thomas's [[Elpis Israel]] and was subsequently baptised in 1853 at the age of 14 in the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]] and joined the &quot;Baptised Believers&quot;. He was 're-baptised' in 1863 &quot;on attaining to an understanding of the things concerning the name of Jesus, of which he was ignorant at his first immersion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christadelphian'' Vol. 11 1874, p.610 (Birmingham: Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 he began to publish ''The Ambassador'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22981 ''A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 7: The City of Birmingham'' W.B. Stephens (Editor) 1964] &quot;Ann Street (later Colmore Row) school was the first Birmingham meeting-place of the Christadelphians, and was used by them from 1864 to 1866, when it was replaced by Athenaeum Hall, Temple Row, q.v. There were 53 members of the ecclesia at the end of 1865. (fn. 46)&quot; &quot;Temple Street, Temperance Hall was used for meetings of the Birmingham ecclesia from 1871, when an attendance of almost 1,000 was claimed. (fn. 79) In 1892 the Sunday evening attendance was 319. (fn. 80) The Temperance Hall ceased to be used for meetings in 1932, and was replaced by meetings at the Midland Institute, Paradise Street, q.v. At the time of the split in 1884 (fn. 81) the Temperance Hall ecclesia adopted the fundamentalist position. Until the reconciliation of 1957 it and its successor at the Midland Institute remained at the head of one of two distinct 'confederations' of ecclesias in Birmingham. (fn. 82)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This was renamed ''The Christadelphian'' in 1869 and continues to be published under that name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christadelphian'' is published by The Christadelphian Magazine &amp; Publishing Association Ltd (Birmingham, UK)&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts was prominent in the period following the death of John Thomas and helped craft the structures of the Christadelphian body.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson writes of Roberts that &quot;The organising ability of Robert Roberts was very important: he gave the movement its rules, institutions and much of its literature&quot;. Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p.399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Roberts was absolutely certain that John Thomas had rediscovered the truth, and it is largely down to Roberts' organisation that the Christadelphian body exists in its present form. His life was characterised by debates over issues that arose within the fledgling organisation and some of this process can be found in the book ''Robert Roberts—A study of his life and character'' by Islip Collyer. He also wrote a booklet called a ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883). Available [http://www.thechristadelphians.org/htm/books/guide/index.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been significant in establishing the basic structure most ecclesias follow today.  

Initially the denomination grew in the English-speaking world, particularly in the [[English Midlands]] and parts of North America. In the early days after the death of John Thomas the group could have moved in many directions. Not everyone believed that John Thomas had established the truth correctly and many doctrinal issues arose, debates were held and statements of faith were created and amended as other issues arose.  These attempts were felt necessary by many to both settle and define a doctrinal stance for the newly emerging denomination and to keep out error.

* In 1873 the [[Nazarene fellowship|Nazarene Fellowship]], led by Edward Turney of Nottingham, separated over the atonement. Following his death in 1879 his most active supporter David Handley of Maldon returned to the main grouping,&lt;ref&gt;Christadelphian Magazine 1881&lt;/ref&gt; and the group gradually died out. In the 1950s Turney's cause, and the name of the group, were revived by Ernest Brady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Introduction | url = http://www.thenazarenefellowship.co.uk | accessdate =2008-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1885 the Suffolk Street Fellowship was formed over the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of the Bible. Robert Ashcroft, a leading member, wrote an article which challenged Christadelphian belief in [[Wiktionary:plenary|plenary]] inspiration and which, although he himself left, led to a division in the main body. One group formed a new ecclesia which later met in Suffolk Street, Birmingham. Other ecclesias throughout the world which supported them became known as the &quot;Suffolk Street fellowship&quot; to distinguish itself from the group they were separated from, which became known as the &quot;Temperance Hall fellowship&quot;. The main magazine of this group from 1884–1957 was ''The Fraternal Visitor'', whose editors included J.J. Bishop and J.J. Hadley (d.1912), then [[Thomas Turner (metallurgist)|Thomas Turner]], and finally Cyril Cooper (till reunion in 1957).

* In 1898 the [[Unamended Christadelphians|Unamended Fellowship]] was separated from as a result of differing views on who would be raised to judgment at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgment will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptized believers.&lt;ref&gt;The Sydney Ecclesia, Australia had already &quot;disfellowshipped&quot; 10 members for denying this in 1883. The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, ecclesial news p.90 and editorial comment p.382&lt;/ref&gt; The majority in Britain, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly. Those who opposed the amendment in North America became known as the &quot;Unamended fellowship&quot; and allowed the teaching that God either could not or would not raise those who had no covenant relationship with him. Opinions vary as to what the established position was on this subject prior to the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.genusa.com/Truth/UnamendedErrors.html Website] claiming views held by Amended community were original Christadelphian beliefs Versus [http://www.republic-christadelphians.org/Unamended.html Website] claiming views held by Unamended community were original Christadelphian beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt; In North America those who continued to associate with Britain on the basis of the amended 1898 statement became known as the [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended Fellowship]],in contrast to the Unamended Fellowship, who took their lead from the ''Christadelphian Advocate'' Magazine of [[Thomas Williams (Christadelphian)|Thomas Williams]] of Chicago.

* In 1923 the [[Berean Christadelphians|Berean Fellowship]] was formed, as a result of varying views on military service in Britain, and on the atonement in North America. In 1942 the Bereans again divided over marriage and divorce with the stricter party forming the Dawn Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Longman |url=http://www.dawnchristadelphian.co.uk/ |title=The Dawn Christadelphian Homepage |publisher=Dawnchristadelphian.co.uk |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnchristadelphians.org |title=A Dawn Christadelphian's Website |publisher=Dawnchristadelphians.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the North American Bereans re-joined the main body of Christadelphians in 1952; though a small number continue as a separate community to the present day.

=== Twentieth century ===
The Christadelphian position on conscientious objection came to the fore with the introduction of conscription during the First World War. Varying degrees of exemption from military service were granted to Christadelphians in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. In the Second World War, this frequently required the person seeking exemption to undertake civilian work under the direction of the authorities. 

During the Second World War the Christadelphians in Britain assisted in the [[Kindertransport]], helping to relocate several hundred Jewish children away from Nazi persecution and founding a hostel [[Elpis Lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =Kinderball piano score | publisher =Imperial War Museum   | url = http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 | accessdate =2008-02-08 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Morrell | first=Leslie | title =The Christadelphian Response to the Holocaust | url = http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany the small Christadelphian community founded by [[Albert Maier]] went underground from 1940–1945, and a leading brother, [[Albert Merz]], was imprisoned as a conscientious objector and later executed.&lt;ref&gt;April 1941 in Berlin.Bogner, Gustav. Geschichte der Christadelphians in Deutschland (2) http://www.projekt-glauben.de/?p=205&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on the restoration of truth has led to a history of division and schism that many have felt unpleasant and that has divided friends and families.  Moves have been made to try to solve them with some success. In the early 1950s the majority of the Berean Fellowship re-joined the Temperance Hall Fellowship, with the remainder continuing as a separate community. In 1957–1958, there was further reunion with the Suffolk Street Fellowship, which had already incorporated many of the Unamended Fellowship outside North America. This re-united group, which now included the large majority of Christadelphians, became known as the Central Fellowship&lt;ref name=&quot;Birmingham 1933, p. 376&quot;&gt;The first use of the term &quot;Birmingham (Central) fellowship&quot; in ''The Christadelphian'' magazine was in volume 70, 1933, p. 376. The term was used to distinguish those ecclesias in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) ecclesia from those in the &quot;Suffolk Street Fellowship&quot;. By 1939 the word &quot;Birmingham&quot; was dropped and the term &quot;Central Fellowship&quot; was thereafter used with some regularity (342 times between 1939 and 2000) in ''[[The Christadelphian]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; named after the Birmingham Central ecclesia. In Australia and New Zealand a union occurred in 1958 between the Central fellowship and the Shield fellowship (which was allied to the Suffolk Street fellowship) through an understanding expressed in a document called the Cooper-Carter Addendum. Those who held that the reasons for separation from the Suffolk Street Fellowship remained, opposed the re-union and formed the Old Paths Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gospeltruth.info |title=Old Paths Fellowship (Australia) |publisher=Gospeltruth.info |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphians.co.uk |title=Old Paths Fellowship (UK) |publisher=Christadelphians.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some co-operation between the Central (Amended) and Unamended Fellowships in North America – most recently in the Great Lakes region, where numerous Amended &amp; Unamended ecclesias have opened fellowship to one another despite the failure of wider attempts at re-union under the North American Statement of Understanding (NASU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasu.ca |title=North American Statement of Understanding |publisher=Nasu.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recent years.

Despite success in reuniting large sections of the wider Christadelphian community and periodic efforts at reuniting smaller offshoots, there are still a number of groups who remain separate from other bodies of Christadelphians. These include the Berean Fellowship (who use precisely the same Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith (BASF) as the central fellowship),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bereans.org |title=Berean Christadelphians |publisher=Bereans.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dawn Fellowship, the Old Paths Fellowship, the Companion Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companionchristadelphians.org |title=Companion Christadelphians |publisher=Companion Christadelphians |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pioneer Maranatha Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;The Pioneer and Maranatha Fellowships united in August 2008 [http://www.pioneerchristadelphians.org Pioneer Maranatha Christadelphians]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dawn Christadelphians and the former Lightstand Fellowship in Australia united in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The Dawn Christadelphian Magazine, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the divisions still in existence within the Christadelphian community today stem from further divisions of the Berean fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jim, ''The Berean Christadelphians: Why the Bereans?''

=== Today ===
The post-war, and post-reunions, period saw an increase in co-operation and interaction between ecclesias, resulting in the establishment of a number of week-long Bible schools and the formation of national and [[international]] organisations such as the Christadelphian Bible Mission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbm.org.uk/cbm2histo.htm |title=History of the Christadelphian Bible Mission |publisher=Cbm.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for preaching and pastoral support overseas), the Christadelphian Support Network&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.chsn.org.uk http://www.caregroup.org.au http://www.caringnetwork.ca&lt;/ref&gt; (for counselling), and the [[Meal-a-Day Fund|Christadelphian Meal-A-Day Fund]] (for charity and humanitarian work). 

The period following the reunions was accompanied by expansion in the developing world, which now accounts for around 40% of Christadelphians.&lt;ref&gt;Based on figures from ''CBM Worldwide Guide 2006'', Christadelphian Bible Mission (UK), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
=== Fellowships today ===
Since the reunions in UK and Australia in 1957 two generations of Christadelphians have grown up with little awareness of the existence of the minority &quot;fellowships&quot;, or awareness that the main group is called &quot;Central&quot; by the minority groups. Parallel with this generational change, the articles and books on the doctrine and practice of fellowship with the main &quot;Central&quot; grouping now reject the notion itself of separate &quot;fellowships&quot; among those who recognise the same baptism as &quot;schism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/oates-pearce-1957-booklet-fellowship-and-withdrawal.doc Oates &amp; Pearce ''Fellowship and Withdrawal'' (doc)] 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/whittaker_fellowship_1973.doc H.A. Whittaker ''Block Disfellowship?'' (doc)] articles from [[Testimony Magazine]] 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphianbooks.org/booker/bible_fellowship/ch01.html |title=Biblical Fellowship |publisher=Christadelphianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Andrew. ''Fellowship Matters'', Willow publications, 2nd edition, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; A third significant change, outside North America, has been the shrinking of the minority &quot;fellowships&quot; due to defection to the main group and natural causes. According to [[Bryan Wilson]] functionally the definition of a &quot;fellowship&quot; within Christadelphian History has been mutual or unilateral exclusion of groupings of ecclesias from the breaking of bread.&lt;ref&gt;See Wilson op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; This functional definition still holds true in North America, where two other sizeable groups, [[Unamended Christadelphians]] and  [[Church of the Blessed Hope|CGAF]]  are not received by most North American  [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended]] ecclesias. But outside North America this functional definition no longer holds. Many ecclesias in the &quot;Central&quot; grouping would not refuse a baptised Christadelphian from a minority &quot;fellowship&quot; from breaking bread, the exclusion is more usually the other way. 

Today the Christadelphian body remains divided into &quot;fellowships&quot;, the largest being the Central Fellowship, named after the now-defunct Birmingham Central ecclesia, once its largest and most influential ecclesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birmingham 1933, p. 376&quot;/&gt;  There remains a large number of Unamended Christadelphians, particularly in the US and Canada. Smaller fellowships include the Berean Christadelphians, the Dawn Christadelphians, the Old Paths Christadelphians, and the Pioneer Maranatha Christadelphians.  The number of adherents to the various smaller groups of Christadelphians varies from approximately 1,850 members (the Unamended Christadelphians as of 2006)&lt;ref&gt;''2006 Christadelphian Ecclesial Directory''. Also see ''Unamended Christadelphian'' Wikipedia entry [[Unamended Christadelphians#Organization &amp; worship|here]]&lt;/ref&gt; to groups made up of little more than one or two [[Nuclear family|immediate families]].

They tend to operate organisationally fairly similarly, although there are different emphases.  For instance the [[Berean Christadelphians]] focus on the pioneer Christadelphians and the Dawn Christadelphians put a huge importance on the need to follow a consistent set of disciplines regarding divorce and remarriage. These different Christadelphian fellowships are to some degree localised.  For example, the Unamended Fellowship exists only in North America, and some of the others are confined to the English-speaking world. 

{{wikisource|Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith}}Each fellowship has a Statement of Faith, the most common of which is the ''Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith'' (BASF), named after an ecclesia in Birmingham. This is used by all Old Paths ecclesias without amendment from the days of Robert Roberts.  Most  Unamended ecclesias have a similar Statement of Faith called the ''Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith'' (BUSF)&lt;ref&gt;''Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith''. Available [http://www.monroechristadelphians.com/browser/unamendedsof.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; with one clause being different. The Berean Christadelphians generally use BASF.&lt;ref&gt;[www.bereans.org/basf.html Bereans.org BASF] With some exceptions including the Lampasas Texas Berean Ecclesia. Some have an amendment in the Doctrines to be Rejected which prohibits a person being a police constable.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dawn Christadelphians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnchristadelphians.org |title=Dawn Christadelphians |publisher=Dawn Christadelphians |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; use a statement of faith which is based on the original 1886 statement of faith, but has four additions addressing issues that have arisen since that time. Some Christadelphian groups which are separated to a greater or lesser degree from the main body of Christadelphians use [[statement of faith|statements of faith]] which differ in some regard from the BASF and from each other.  Within the &quot;Central&quot; grouping individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community.

For each fellowship, anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in the statement and is in good standing in their &quot;home ecclesia&quot; is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia.

=== General organisation ===
In the absence of centralised organisation, some differences exist amongst Christadelphians on matters of belief and practice.  This is because each congregation (commonly styled 'ecclesias') is organised [[wiktionary:autonomous|autonomously]], typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Most ecclesias have a constitution,&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/constitution.htm Constitution of the Birmingham Christadelphian Ecclesia, Midland Institute] c.1932-onwards&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a 'Statement of Faith', a list of 'Doctrines to be Rejected' and a formalized list of 'The Commandments of Christ'.&lt;ref&gt;This list as published by [[The Christadelphian Magazine]] contains 53 paraphrases of Bible verses which were originally read weekly as part of the service at Temperance Hall ecclesia. Other versions, of unconfirmed origin, exist with the list expanded to 100 including some verses justifying division.&lt;/ref&gt; With no central authority individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the Statement of Faith is seen by many as useful to this end. The Statement of Faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of consultation, mediation, and discussion, with disfellowship (similar to [[excommunication]]) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 32, 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative uniformity of organisation and practice is undoubtedly due to the influence of a booklet, written early in Christadelphian history, called ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;/&gt; It recommends a basically democratic arrangement by which congregational members elect 'brothers' to arranging and serving duties,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 17–27&lt;/ref&gt; and includes guidelines for the organisation of committees, as well as conflict resolution between congregational members and between congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 35–38, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; Christadelphians do not have paid [[minister of religion|ministers]]. Male members are assessed by the congregation for their eligibility to teach and perform other duties, which are usually assigned on a rotation basis, as opposed to having a permanently appointed preacher. Congregational governance typically follows a [[democracy|democratic]] model, with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia's members.

Inter-ecclesial organisations co-ordinate the running of, among other things, Christadelphian schools&lt;ref&gt;For example: Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Cooranbong)|Heritage College, Cooranbong]] and Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Sydney)|Heritage College Sydney]], Kemps Creek.&lt;/ref&gt; and elderly care homes, the [[Christadelphian Isolation League]] (which cares for those prevented by distance or infirmity from attending an ecclesia regularly) and the publication of [[:Category:Christadelphian magazines|Christadelphian magazines]].

== Beliefs ==
Due to the way the Christadelphian body is organised there is no central authority to establish and maintain a standardised set of beliefs and it depends what Statement of Faith is adhered to and how liberal the ecclesia is, but there are core doctrines most Christadelphians would accept.  In the formal statements of faith a more complete list is found.  For instance in the Central Fellowship, the BASF the official Statement of Faith has 30 doctrines to be accepted and 35 to be rejected.

=== The Bible ===
Christadelphians state that their beliefs&lt;ref&gt;''A Declaration of the Truth revealed in the Bible'' (Birmingham: Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association). An early summary of Christadelphian beliefs. Available [http://users.aol.com/bible2007/declare.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; are based wholly on the [[Bible]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hyndman&quot;/&gt; and they accept no other texts as inspired by [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bull  | first =Mike| title =The Bible—The Word of God | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_bible.htm | isbn =81-87409-52-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== God ===
They believe that God is the creator of all things and the father of true believers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Drabbenstott | first =Mark| title =God Our Father | publisher =Printland Publishers | year=2000 | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_father.htm | isbn =81-87409-64-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he is a separate being from his son, [[Jesus]] Christ,&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Flint | first =James | coauthors = Deb Flint | title =One God or a Trinity? | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_onegod.htm | isbn =81-87409-61-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title =Jesus: God the Son or Son of God?| publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/jesussonofgod.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[Holy_Spirit#Christadelphians|Holy Spirit]] is the power of God used in creation and for [[Salvation#Salvation|salvation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spirit&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Tennant| first =Harry | title =The Holy Spirit—Bible Understanding of God's Power | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/holysprt.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that the phrase ''Holy Spirit'' sometimes refers to God's character/mind, depending on the context in which the phrase appears,&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Broughton | first = James H. | authorlink = | coauthors = Peter J Southgate | title = The Trinity: True or False? | publisher = The Dawn Book Supply | date = | location = UK | pages = | url = http://www.biblelight.org/trin/trinind.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but reject the orthodox Christian view that we need strength, guidance and power from the Holy Spirit to live the Christian life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Whittaker | first =Edward | last2 =Carr| first2 =Reg | title ='Spirit' in the New Testament| publisher =The Testimony | location = | url = }}, p. 117,132,145&lt;/ref&gt; believing instead that the spirit a believer needs within themselves is the mind/character of God, which is developed in a believer by their reading of the Bible (which, they believe, contains words God gave by his Spirit) and trying to live by what it says during the events of their lives which God uses to help shape their character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Pearce| first =Graham | title =The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Gifts| publisher =Logos | location = | url =http://www.antipas.org/books/holy_spirit_pearce/hsp_toc.html }}, p. 27-29.

If I be asked, what is the manner in which he teaches this religion, I reply in the same way that all teachers convey instruction to their pupils; ''by words, either spoken or written''. ... Now Paul says that the ''sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise to salvation, by the faith'' (or gospel) ''which is through Jesus Christ''. What more do we want than wisdom in relation to this matter? If the sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise, we need no other instrumentality. The Holy Spirit by the word, without infusing a single idea into it more than it actually and ordinarily contains, and without any collateral influence, teaches us all wisdom and knowledge that is necessary ...' John Thomas, ''The Apostasy Unveiled'', as quoted in G. Pearce, ''The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Gifts'', pp. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jesus ===
Christadelphians believe that Jesus is the promised Jewish [[Messiah]], in whom the prophecies and promises of the [[Old Testament]] find their fulfilment.&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zilmer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Zilmer| first =Paul | title =Who is Jesus? | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_jesus.htm | isbn =81-87409-68-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tennant| first =Harry| title =Christ in the Old Testament: Israel's True Messiah | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/christ.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe he is the [[Son of Man]], in that he inherited human nature (with its inclination to sin) from his mother, and the [[Son of God]] by virtue of his miraculous conception by the power of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zilmer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title =Do You Believe in a Devil? | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/doyoubelieve.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was tempted, Jesus committed no sin, and was therefore a perfect representative sacrifice to bring salvation to sinful humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zilmer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;/&gt; They believe that God raised Jesus from death and gave him [[immortality]], and he ascended to [[Heaven]], God's dwelling place.&lt;ref name=&quot;zilmer&quot;/&gt; Christadelphians believe that he will return to the earth in person to set up the Kingdom of God in fulfilment of the promises made to [[Abraham]] and [[David (biblical king)|David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilson| first=Shiela | title =The End of the World: Horror Story—or Bible Hope? | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/endworld.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Scott| first =Malcom |  title =Christ is Coming Again! | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_coming.htm | isbn =81-87409-34-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the belief that the coming Kingdom will be the restoration of God's first Kingdom of Israel, which was under David and Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Morgan | first= Tecwyn | title =Christ is Coming!

=== Salvation ===
Christadelphians believe that people are separated from God because of their sins, but can be reconciled to him by becoming disciples of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Watkins| first=Peter | title =The Cross of Christ| publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/cross.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salvation&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Flint| first=James| coauthors = Deb Flint | title =Salvation | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_salvation.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is by belief in the gospel, through [[repentance]], and through [[baptism]] by total immersion in water.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baptism&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=| title =Why Baptism Really Matters: What must we do to be saved?| publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/whybaptism.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not believe we can be sure of being saved, believing instead that salvation comes as a result of a life of obedience to the commands of Christ &lt;ref&gt;Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith, Doctrine to be Rejected no 24 'That the gospel alone will save without the obedience of Christ's commandments'.&lt;/ref&gt; After death, believers are in a state of [[Psychopannychism|non-existence]], knowing nothing until the [[Resurrection]] at the return of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =After Death – What? | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/afterdeath.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the judgement at that time, the accepted receive the gift of [[immortality]], and live with Christ on a restored Earth, assisting him to establish the [[Kingdom of God]] and to rule over the mortal population for a thousand years (the [[Millennialism|Millennium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= | title =Raised to Judgement: Bible Teaching about Resurrection &amp; Judgement | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/judgment.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christadelphians believe that the Kingdom will be centred upon Israel, but Jesus Christ will also reign over all the other nations on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =M.| title =Israel: God's People, God's Land | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/israelgodsland.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the Kingdom itself is not worldwide but limited to the land of Israel promised to Abraham and ruled over in the past by David, with a worldwide empire.&lt;ref&gt;See ''What is the true Gospel?'', available [http://www.gospeltruth.info/gospel.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection of some traditional doctrines ===
Christadelphians reject a number of doctrines held by many other Christians, notably the immortality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[trinitarianism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity2&quot;/&gt; the [[pre-existence of Christ]],&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity2&quot;/&gt; the baptism of infants,&lt;ref name=&quot;baptism&quot;/&gt; the personhood of the Holy Spirit&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spirit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity2&quot;/&gt; and the present-day possession of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;spirit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zilmer&quot;/&gt; They believe that the word [[devil]] is a reference to sin and human nature in opposition to God while the word [[satan]] is merely a reference to an adversary (be it good or bad). According to Christadelphians, these terms are used in reference to specific political systems or individuals in opposition or conflict. [[Hell]] is understood to refer to death and the grave, rather than being a place of eternal torment.&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christadelphia.org/reject.htm ''Doctrines to be Rejected'']—an appendix to the Christadelphian statement of faith&lt;/ref&gt; Christadelphians do not believe that anyone can go to Heaven.  Instead, they believe that only Christ Jesus went to Heaven, and when Christ Jesus comes back to the earth the true believers will live in the Land of Israel which will be the Kingdom of God on Earth. Christadelphians believe the doctrines they reject were introduced into [[Christendom]] after the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;''Answering Common Questions about the Christadelphians'' from [https://sites.google.com/site/christadelphianinfo/articles/apologetics/critics/cqa Christadelphian Info]&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be demonstrated from the Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jesus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity2&quot;/&gt;

=== Life in Christ===
{{wikisource|The  Commandments of Christ}}The historic ''[[wikisource:the Commandments of Christ|Commandments of Christ]]'' demonstrates the community's recognition of the importance of Biblical teaching on morality. Marriage and family life are important. Christadelphians believe that sexual relationships are limited to heterosexual marriage, ideally between baptised believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Christian Life: Marriage—&quot;Only in the Lord&quot;  | url=http://www.bibleed.com/bibleteachings/christianlife/marriage.asp | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and the Church: Bible Answers to Moral Questions'' (Birmingham: Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association). Available [http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/homosex.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other historical groups and individuals with some shared doctrines ==
One criticism of the Christadelphian movement has been over the claim of John Thomas and Roberts Roberts to have &quot;rediscovered&quot; scriptural truth.&lt;ref&gt;Christendom Astray, Robert Roberts, written 1862, Lecture 1: 'Do you mean to say, asks the incredulous enquirer, that the Bible has been studied by men of learning for eighteen centuries without being understood?  and that the thousands of ministers set apart for the very purpose of ministering in its holy pages are all mistaken?'  (He then goes on to suggest that social conditioning, self interest by the clergy and an incomplete reformation prevented its rediscovery.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In an article 'A Glance at The History and Mystery of Christadelphianism', a contemporary of John Thomas, David King, from the Restoration Movement 1881, argues that a complete losing of truth would have been unlikely.  Available [http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~pdover/histmyst.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; However, although both men believed that they had &quot;recovered&quot; the true doctrines for themselves and contemporaries, they also believed there had always existed a group of true believers throughout the ages, albeit marred by the apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;'An arrangement of this sort was absolutely necessary for '''the preservation and protection of the One Body, witnessing for the truth''' against &quot;the worshipping of the daemonials and idols&quot;, in the midst of the nations, and &quot;before the God of the earth;&quot; the weapons of whose warfare were civil disabilities, and the infernal tortures of anti-heretical crusaders and inquisitions.', John Thomas, 'Eureka' (1915 edition), volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''''Thus, the history of the ages and the generations of the unmeasured Court is in strict harmony with this prophecy of the witnesses'''. For a period considerably over a thousand years after Rome renounced its old gods for the ghosts, dry bones, and fables of the catholic superstition, '''the Spirit had provided himself with Two Witnessing Classes, to whose custody he providentially committed the truth''', and its judicial vindication by fire and sword.', John Thomas, 'Eureka', volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Though the apostles died, their work continued, '''and the generation of believers that went to the grave with them were succeeded by other believers who maintained the integral structure of the temple of God, founded in Europe'''. True, the work was marred and corrupted by the apostasy of the mass: '''still, a real work—a real temple, existed, consisting of the remnant of true believers preserved by God as His witnesses in the midst of the prevailing corruption'''.', Robert Roberts, 'Thirteen Lectures On The Apocalypse' (4th edition 1921), page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most notable Christadelphian attempts to find a continuity of those with doctrinal similarities since that point have been geographer [[Alan Eyre]]'s two books ''[http://www.antipas.org/books/protesters/prot_toc.html The Protesters]'' (1975) and ''[http://www.antipas.org/books/brethren_in_christ/binc_toc.html Brethren in Christ]'' (1982) in which he shows that many individual Christadelphian doctrines had been previously believed.  Eyre focused in particular on the [[Radical Reformation]], and also among the [[Socinians]] and other early [[Unitarians]] and the [[English Dissenters]]. In this way, Eyre was able to demonstrate substantial historical precedents for individual Christadelphian teachings and practices, and believed that the Christadelphian community was the 'inheritor of a noble tradition, by which elements of the Truth were from century to century hammered out on the anvil of controversy, affliction and even anguish'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan Eyre page 8&quot;&gt;Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 8 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although noting in the introduction to 'The Protestors' that 'Some recorded herein perhaps did not have &quot;all the truth&quot; — so the writer has been reminded',&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan Eyre page 8&quot;/&gt; Eyre nevertheless claimed that the purpose of the work was to 'tell how a number of little-known individuals, groups and religious communities strove to preserve or revive the original Christianity of apostolic times',&lt;ref&gt;Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 11 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and that 'In faith and outlook they were far closer to the early springing shoots of 1st-century Christianity and the penetrating spiritual challenge of Jesus himself than much that has passed for the religion of the Nazarene in the last nineteen centuries'.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', pages 11–12 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyre's research has been criticized by some of his Christadelphian peers,&lt;ref&gt;Both of Eyre's works were criticized by Ruth McHaffie 'Finding Founders and Facing Facts' (2001), in which evidence was presented suggesting that Eyre had misread a number of his sources, and that some his claims could not be supported from (and were often contradicted by) the available historical evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result Christadelphian commentary on the subject was subsequently more cautious and circumspect, with caveats being issued concerning Eyre's claims,&lt;ref&gt;'But some, though having neither time nor opportunity to search archives, knew enough to realise that the claims were exaggerated, however praiseworthy the intention. Moreover, misgivings increased as the years passed and when members examined the subject more closely for themselves.  As explained in the November 1993 issue of The Endeavour Magazine, Brother Ron Coleman in 1986, when preparing an address for the Oxford ecclesia to commemorate the 450th anniversary of William Tyndale's death, not only sought information from The Protesters but also from Tyndale's own writings. He was surprised to find serious misrepresentations in our community's publication.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Founding Fathers And Facing Facts', (2001), page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'In 1989 when an article by Brother Alan appeared in The Christadelphian containing a number of inaccuracies on the hymn writer Isaac Watts,, editor of The Christadelphian, and subsequently corresponded with Alan in the manner which becomes Brethren.  Scholarly evidence to disprove Ron's criticisms was not forthcoming with regard to either Tyndale or Watts, and the editor was requested to publish a short note of amendment on both writers, but there appears to have been no response.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Founding Fathers And Facing Facts', (2001), page 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the two books less used and publicized than in previous years.

Nevertheless, all the distinctive Christadelphian doctrines, down to interpretations of specific verses, can be found particularly among 16th century [[Socinianism|Socinian]] writers (e.g. the rejection of the doctrines of the trinity, [[pre-existence of Christ]], immortal souls, a literal hell of fire, original sin)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document  | last = Pope  | first = Hugh  | contribution = Socinianism  | year = 1912  | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia  | editor-last =   | editor-first =  | volume = 14  | place = New York  | publisher =  Robert Appleton Company  | contribution-url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14113a.htm  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early English Unitarian writings also correspond closely to those of Christadelphians. Also, recent discoveries and research have shown a large similarity between Christadelphian beliefs and those held by [[Isaac Newton#Religious views|Isaac Newton]] who, among other things, rejected the doctrines of the trinity, immortal souls, a personal devil and literal demons. Even with most source writings of those later considered &quot;heretics&quot; destroyed, evidence can be provided that since the 1st century CE there have been various groups and individuals who have held certain individual Christadelphian beliefs or similar ones. 

For example:
* The typical Old Testament belief in unconsciousness till resurrection,&lt;ref&gt;The Christadelphian understanding of Daniel 12:2, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Barr is surely right to stress that the Genesis story as it now stands indicates that humans were not created immortal, but had (and lost) the chance to gain unending life.’, Wright, ‘The Resurrection of the Son of God’, p. 92 (2003); Wright himself actually interprets some passages of Scripture as indicating alternative beliefs, ‘The Bible offers a spectrum of belief about life after death’,Wright, ‘The Resurrection of the Son of God’, p. 129 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘In contrast to the two enigmatic references to Enoch and Elijah, there are ample references to the fact that death is the ultimate destiny for all human beings, that God has no contact with or power over the dead, and that the dead do not have any relationship with God (see, inter alia, Ps. 6:6, 30:9–10, 39:13–14, 49:6–13, 115:16–18, 146:2–4). If there is a conceivable setting for the introduction of a doctrine of the afterlife, it would be in Job, since Job, although righteous, is harmed by God in the present life. But Job 10:20–22 and 14:1–10 affirm the opposite.’, Gillman, ‘Death and Afterlife, Judaic Doctrines Of’, in Neusner, ‘The Encyclopedia of Judaism’, volume 1, p. 176 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘ “Who knows whether the breath of human beings rises up and the breath of an animal sinks down to the earth?” (Eccles 3:21). In Qohelet’s day there were perhaps people who were speculating that human beings would enjoy a positive afterlife, as animals would not. Qohelet points out that there is no evidence for this.’, Goldingay, ‘Old Testament Theology’, volume 2, p. 644 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘The life of a human being came more directly from God, and it is also evident that when someone dies, the breath (rûaḥ, e.g., Ps 104:29) or the life (nepeš, e.g., Gen 35:18) disappears and returns to the God who is rûaḥ. And whereas the living may hope that the absence of God may give way again to God’s presence, the dead are forever cut off from God’s presence.241 Death means an end to fellowship with God and to fellowship with other people. It means an end to the activity of God and the activity of other people. Even more obviously, it means an end to my own activity. It means an end to awareness.’, ibid., p. 640&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the immortality of the soul, has been held marginally throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity&lt;ref&gt;'In the first place, there have not been a few, both in ancient and modern times, who have maintained the truth of a &quot;Conditional Immortality&quot;.', McConnell, ‘The Evolution of Immortality’, p. 84 (1901).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'At the same time there have always been isolated voices raised in support of other views. There are hints of a belief in repentance after death, as well as conditional immortality and annihilationism.', Streeter, et al., ‘Immortality: An Essay in Discovery, Co-Ordinating Scientific, Psychical, and Biblical Research’, p. 204 (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Many biblical scholars down throughout history, looking at the issue through Hebrew rather than Greek eyes, have denied the teaching of innate immortality.’, Knight, 'A brief history of Seventh-Day Adventists', p. 42 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Various concepts of conditional immortality or annihilationism have appeared earlier in Baptist history as well. Several examples illustrate this claim. General as well as particular Baptists developed versions of annihilationism or conditional immortality.’, Pool, ‘Against returning to Egypt: Exposing and Resisting Credalism in the Southern Baptist Convention’, p. 133 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;: such sources include certain Jewish pseudepigraphal works,&lt;ref&gt;'However, Strack and Billerbeck, noted authorities on Rabbinic literature, suggest that the pseudepigraphal references to eternal punishment simply denote everlasting annihilation.

Aphrahat insists - as does Ephrem - &quot;that as yet no one has received his reward. For the righteous have not inherited the Kingdom, nor have the wicked gone into torment&quot; (8.22; fc. 20). At present, the dead simply &quot;sleep&quot; in their graves, which are collectively referred to as Sheol, or the underworld. Their capabilities for activity and experience are, apparently, almost non-existent, &quot;for when people die, the animal spirit is buried with the body and sense is taken away from it, but the heavenly spirit they receive [i.e. the Holy Spirit, given in baptism] goes, according to its nature, to Christ&quot; (6.14). Aphrahat, however, seems to ascribe to the dead a kind of anticipatory consciousness of their own future which is akin to dreaming in earthly sleep.', Daley, ‘The hope of the early church: a handbook of patristic eschatology’, p. 73 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The wicked will be sent back to Sheol, the real of Death under the world (22.17.24; cf. 6.6), where they will be punished in the measure and the way that their sins deserve - some in &quot;outer darkness,&quot; others in unquenchable fire, others by simple exclusion from the presence of God (22.18-22).', ibid., p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]],&lt;ref&gt;'Ephrem, too, conceives of the time between our death and the second coming of Jesus as a &quot;sleep,&quot; a period of inactivity in virtually every aspect of human existence. Because his anthropology is more highly developed than Aphrahat's, and because he is so insistent - in contrast to Bardaisan and other earlier, more dualistic Syriac writers - that the human person needs both body and soul to be functional, Ephrem seems to imagine that this sleep as [sic] deprived even of the &quot;dreaming&quot; Aphrahat mentions. For Ephrem, the soul without the body is &quot;bound,&quot; &quot;paralyzed&quot; (CN 476.6); it is like an embryo in its mother's womb or like a blind or deaf person: &quot;living, but deprived of word and thought&quot; (HP 8.4-6).', ibid., p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Because of his insistence on the positive role of the body in human life and its necessity for a full human existence (e.g., CN 47.4), Ephrem sees eschatological reward and punishment as delayed until the resurrection of the dead.

From the moment that her lover deserted her, he recounts, nephesh lost her speech and fell into a deep slumber. In spite of this, even in this state of forced inertia, she maintained her essential characteristics: her galloping intellect, her acute judgement, the emotions that open up a view in the world. The reason that all her faculties had ceased to function is that they had no more any purpose to serve, since the body for the sake of which they operated was no longer there. Nephesh recovered her sentience and her speech at the end of time when, together with the body, she rose to give an account for her deeds. Till then she felt no pain or joy.

Then those who died in &quot;peace and quiet&quot; with the lord will find eternal peace (Bedjan 276.15), while sinners will be banished to a darkness far away from God (Bedjan 117f.). Gehenna, the kingdom of the demons (Bedjan 203.4 from bottom), is a place of fire, and on the day of judgment this fire will burst forth from the bodies of the damned (Bedjan 73.4.; 118.3-7). Until the resurrection, the dead must wait in Sheol, which the author seems to imagine as a collective grave (Bedjan 366.3 from bottom; 368.5; 369.4). Some passages in the corpus suggest that the dead continue to act, in Sheol, as they have during life (e.g., Bedjan 90.13; 366.10-18).

Organised worship in England for those whose beliefs anticipated those of Christadelphians only truly became possible in 1779 when the [[Act of Toleration 1689]] was amended to permit denial of the Trinity, and only fully when property penalties were removed in the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]]. This is only 35 years before John Thomas' 1849 lecture tour in Britain which attracted significant support from an existing [[non-Trinitarian]] [[Adventist]] base, particularly, initially, in Scotland where [[Arian]] [[Socinian]] and unitarian (with a small 'u' as distinct from the Unitarian Church of [[Theophilus Lindsey]]) views were prevalent.

== Modern mainstream theology developing similar beliefs ==
Over the last 100 years mainstream Christian theologians and Biblical scholars have gradually been developing beliefs which the Christadelphian community has historically held. Example areas are satan and demons; the atonement; justification; heaven and hell; the state of the dead. 

* '''The state of the dead''': The majority of standard scholarly Jewish and Christian sources today describe the state of the dead in terms identical or very close to the Christadelphian view.&lt;ref&gt;‘For a Hebrew, ‘soul’ indicated the unity of a human person; Hebrews were living bodies, they did not have bodies. This Hebrew field of meaning is breached in the Wisdom of Solomon by explicit introduction of Greek ideas of soul. A dualism of soul and body is present: ‘a perishable body weighs down the soul’ (9:15). This perishable body is opposed by an immortal soul (3:1-3). Such dualism might imply that soul is superior to body. In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20). ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23). Although the Greek idea of an immortal soul different in kind from the mortal body is not evident, ‘soul’ denotes the existence of a person after death (see Luke 9:25; 12:4; 21:19); yet Greek influence may be found in 1 Peter’s remark about ‘the salvation of souls’ (1:9). A moderate dualism exists in the contrast of spirit with body and even soul, where ‘soul’ means life that is not yet caught up in grace. See also Flesh and Spirit; Human Being.’, Neyrey, ‘Soul’, in Achtemeier, Harper, &amp; Row (eds.), ‘Harper’s Bible Dictionary’, pp. 982-983 (1st ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Indeed, the salvation of the “immortal soul” has sometimes been a commonplace in preaching, but it is fundamentally unbiblical. Biblical anthropology is not dualistic but monistic: human being consists in the integrated wholeness of body and soul, and the Bible never contemplates the disembodied existence of the soul in bliss.’, Myers (ed.), ‘The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary’, p. 518 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘A particular instance of the Heb. avoidance of dualism is the biblical doctrine of man. Greek thought, and in consequence many Hellenizing Jewish and Christian sages, regarded the body as a prison-house of the soul: sōma sēma ‘the body is a tomb’. The aim of the sage was to achieve deliverance from all that is bodily and thus liberate the soul. But to the Bible man is not a soul in a body but a body/soul unity; so true is this that even in the resurrection, although flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, we shall still have bodies (1 Cor. 15:35ff.).’, Cressey, ‘Dualism’, in Cressey, Wood, &amp; Marshall (eds.), ‘New Bible Dictionary’, p. 284 (3rd. ed. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term “soul,” we must be clear that Scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew Scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.’, Avery-Peck, ‘Soul’, in Neusner, et al. (eds.), ‘The Encyclopedia of Judaism’, p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘‎Gn. 2:7 refers to God forming Adam ‘from the dust of the ground’ and breathing ‘into his nostrils the breath of life’, so that man becomes a ‘living being’. The word ‘being’ translates the Hebrew word nep̄eš which, though often translated by the Eng. word ‘soul’, ought not to be interpreted in the sense suggested by Hellenistic thought (see Platonism; Soul, Origin of). It should rather be understood in its own context within the OT as indicative of men and women as living beings or persons in relationship to God and other people. The lxx translates this Heb. word nep̄eš with the Gk. word psychē, which explains the habit of interpreting this OT concept in the light of Gk. use of psychē. Yet it is surely more appropriate to understand the use of psychē (in both the lxx and the NT) in the light of the OT’s use of nep̄eš. According to Gn. 2, any conception of the soul as a separate (and separable) part or division of our being would seem to be invalid. Similarly, the popular debate concerning whether human nature is a bipartite or tripartite being has the appearance of a rather ill-founded and unhelpful irrelevancy. The human person is a ‘soul’ by virtue of being a ‘body’ made alive by the ‘breath’ (or ‘Spirit’) of God.’, Ferguson &amp; Packer (eds.),’New Dictionary of Theology’, pp. 28-29 (electronic ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Far from referring simply to one aspect of a person, “soul” refers to the whole person. Thus, a corpse is referred to as a “dead soul,” even though the word is usually translated “dead body” (Lev. 21:11; Num. 6:6). “Soul” can also refer to a person’s very life itself 1 Kgs. 19:4; Ezek. 32:10).‎“Soul” often refers by extension to the whole person.’, Carrigan, ‘Soul’, Freedman, Myers, &amp; Beck (eds.) ‘Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible’, p. 1245 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘There is no suggestion in the OT of the transmigration of the soul as an immaterial, immortal entity. Man is a unity of body and soul—terms that describe not so much two separate entities in a person as much as one person from different standpoints. Hence, in the description of man’s creation in Genesis 2:7, the phrase “a living soul” (kjv) is better translated as “a living being.”’, Elwell &amp; Comfort (eds.), ‘Tyndale Bible dictionary, p. 1216 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘It has been noted already that the soul, like the body, derives from God. This implies that man is composed of soul and body, and the Bible makes it plain that this is so. The soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man. Disembodied existence in Sheol is unreal. Paul does not seek a life outside the body, but wants to be clothed with a new and spiritual body (1 Cor. 15; 2 Cor. 5).’, Bromiley, ‘Psychology’, in Bromiley, ‘The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia’, volume 3, p. 1045 (rev. ed. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Nor is any place left for dualism. Soul and body are not separate entities which are able to work in concert by virtue of a preestablished harmony (Leibniz).’ , ibid., p. 1045.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘All Christians believe in immortality, understood as a final resurrection to everlasting life. The majority have held that immortality also includes continuing existence of the soul or person between death and resurrection. Almost every detail of this general confession and its biblical basis, however, has been disputed. The debate has been fueled by the development of beliefs about the afterlife within the Bible itself and the variety of language in which they are expressed. The Hebrew Bible does not present the human soul (nepeš) or spirit (rûah) as an immortal substance, and for the most part it envisions the dead as ghosts in Sheol, the dark, sleepy underworld. Nevertheless it expresses hope beyond death (see Pss. 23 and 49:15) and eventually asserts physical resurrection (see Isa. 26:19; Dan. 12:2).’, Cooper, ‘Immortality’, in Fahlbusch &amp; Bromiley (eds.), ‘The Encyclopedia of Christianity’, volume 2, p. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘soul. The idea of a distinction between the soul, the immaterial principle of life and intelligence, and the body is of great antiquity, though only gradually expressed with any precision. Hebrew thought made little of this distinction, and there is practically no specific teaching on the subject in the Bible beyond an underlying assumption of some form of afterlife (see immortality)., Cross &amp; Livingstone, (eds.), ‘The Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church’, p. 1531 (3rd rev. ed. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘The English translation of nepeš by the term “soul” has too often been misunderstood as teaching a bipartite (soul and body—dichotomy) or tripartite (body, soul, and spirit—trichotomy) anthropology. Equally misleading is the interpretation that too radically separates soul from body as in the Greek view of human nature. See body; spirit. N. Porteous (in IDB, 4:428) states it well when he says, “The Hebrew could not conceive of a disembodied nepeš, though he could use nepeš with or without the adjective ‘dead,’ for corpse (e.g., Lev. 19:28; Num. 6:6).” Or as R. B. Laurin has suggested, “To the Hebrew, man was not a ‘body’ and a ‘soul,’ but rather a ‘body-soul,’ a unit of vital power” (BDT, 492). In this connection, the most significant text is Gen. 2:7, “the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life [nišmat hayyîm], and the man became a living being [nepeš hayyâ]” (the KJV rendering “living soul” is misleading).’, Lake, ‘Soul’, in Silva &amp; Tenney (eds.), ‘The Zondervan Encyclopedia of the Bible’, volume 5, p. 586 (rev. ed. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The atonement''': The majority Christian interpretation of the atonement as [[penal substitution]] has been criticized in mainstream Christianity since the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;'The character of the needed reform became more and more clear : Christian thought must be brought over from the point of view of law to that of the conscience, it must be raised from legality to morality. Those even who wished to adhere as far as possible to the tradition of the past, tried to find a new foundation for the doctrine of substitution in the moral fact of solidarity. They gave up justifying the expiatory condemnation of Christ on the plea that divine justice must be satisfied; they were content to insist upon the organic bond which united the Son of man with the whole race. This method of argumentation, the first sketch of which was given by Ch. Secretan, and which was powerfully developed by so many orators, among whom should be mentioned E. Bersier, Ed. de Pressense, and Ch. Bois, has the advantage of being modem; but it remains to be seen whether, from a logical point of view, the argument does not ruin the ancient edifice it was destined to support.', Sabatier, 'The Doctrine of the Atonement: And Its Historical Evolution and Religion; and, Religion and Modern Culture ', pp. 92-93 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘But new challenges to the position arose in the modern period and were accepted by more and more churches. Able apologists for the penal substitutionary view also defended and developed that position against these new theories.’, Allison, ‘History of the Doctrine of the Atonement’, Southern Baptist Journal of Theology ( 11.2.15), 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in increasing rejection of traditional penal substitution.&lt;ref&gt;‘In the twenty-first century, the doctrine of the atonement has come under fierce attack. Particularly singled out for criticism is the penal-substitutionary theory because, according to its detractors, it privileges one (outmoded) metaphor of the atonement, it fosters passivity in the face of evil and oppression, and it even encourages child abuse. Some evangelicals, disturbed by these criticisms, have sought to revise the traditional doctrine. Many evangelicals, however, rehearse and defend the penal substitutionary model.’, Allison, ‘History of the Doctrine of the Atonement’, Southern Baptist Journal of Theology ( 11.2.16-17), 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The Christadelphian distinction between representation and substitution has been noted in the relevant scholarly literature,&lt;ref&gt;'Christadelphian writers point to the fact that there is a great difference between a 'representative' and a 'substitute'. A representative, they hold, is not disconnected from those represented, whereas a substitute performs a role instead of those for whom he or she is substitute.', Scotland, 'Sectarian Religion in Contemporary Britain', p. 49 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and representative participation (an interpretation long held by Christadelphians&lt;ref&gt;‘The true believer is in Christ “for the obtaining of the blessings promised,” it is true, but his obtainment thereof is strictly subject to his recognition of the means by which they were “purchased.” The first act he is called upon to perform is a participation in those means, viz., the death of Christ.’, Roberts, ‘Answers to Correspondents’, Christadelphian Magazine (7.67.23), 1870&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Therefore, in the very act of putting on the name of Christ “for the obtaining of the blessings promised,” he is made to endorse and morally participate in the “condemnation of sin in the flesh,” which Jesus underwent in the “body preared” for the purpose.—(Heb. 10:5.)’ , ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘By this three-fold preparation, entering within the circle of righteousness, participation in the one great sacrifice, and “the washing of water by the Word,” we antitypically enter into the Holy place, where the candlestick was to be seen in the type.’, WHB, ‘The Temple Exhibition’, Christadelphian Magazine (44.522.540), 1907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘This, then, is the way of approach to God—by voluntary entrance into Christ and a participation in his death. Thus each individual coming to God must first of all recognise the principles involved in the crucifixion, virtually proclaim his own worthiness of death and at the same time declare, in a practical manner, God’s righteousness.’, Walker, ‘The Cross of Christ’, Christadelphian Magazine (55.652.457), 1918&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘The final meeting, on the subject “Risen with Christ”, emphasized the nature and the means of our participation now in Christ’s resurrection.', Sargent, ‘The Ecclesial Visitor’, Christadelphian Magazine (104.1235.230), 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘The Apostle’s reasoning in Romans 6 on the nature of baptism as a dying with Christ, a participation in his crucifixion, is reinforced here by his categorical “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God” (v. 3).’, Nicholls, ‘Editorial’, Christadelphian Magazine (120.1428.201-202), 1983&lt;/ref&gt;), is widely considered the original Biblical teaching on the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;‘Christ’s love, according to Kenneth Grayston, “is his action in dying not chiefly as a martyr—not solely as our representative—but as our forerunner, to show the way that all must go.”42  In other words, the death and resurrection of Christ “are saving events insofar as Christians participate in them.”43’, Marshall, ‘On A Hill Too Far Away?: Reclaiming The Cross as the Critical Interpretive Principle of the Christian Life’, Review and Expositor (91.2.252), 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Reno says that, in this account, Milbank accords the activity of &quot;interpretive creativity&quot; an indispensable role in the act of atonement itself, which thereby gives rise to the idea of &quot;participatory atonement.&quot;', Hyman, 'The Predicament of Postmodern Theology: Radical Orthodoxy or Nihilist Textualism?', p. 87 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But Paul's teaching is not that Christ dies &quot;in the place of&quot; others so that they escape death (as the logic of &quot;substitution&quot; implies).86 It is rather that Christ's sharing their death makes it possible for them to share his death. “Representation” is not an adequate single-word description, nor particularly “participation” or “participatory event”. But at least they help convey the sense of a continuing identification with Christ in, through, and beyond his death, which, as we shall see, is fundamental to Paul’s soteriology.’,  Dunn, ‘The Theology of Paul the Apostle’, p. 223 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘In the Roman Church, after the critique by Sabourin and Lyonnet and under the climate created by Teilhard de Chardin and Rahner, few scholars of note, if any, have maintained it. K. Barth again proclaimed that Christ was “the Judge judged in our stead” but expressly repudiated the doctrine that he was so punished as to spare us death and to “satisfy” the demands of wrath (CD IV/1, §59/2, fine print after about 40 percent of the section). In their later writings Moltmann and Pannenberg have come closer to evangelical language. However, Moltmann denies that God’s wrath was appeased (25–26), and Pannenberg, despite strong statements of penal substitution (425–27), claims that “the reconciling death of Christ is not a payment that Christ made to God in place of others” (429; 448, against “satisfaction”).’, Vanhoozer, et al (eds.), 'Dictionary for theological interpretation of the Bible', p. 73 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Sanders goes so far as to argue that &quot;the purpose of Christ's death [for Paul is ] that Christians may participate in it, not that their sins may be atoned for.&quot;.', Finlan, 'The background and content of Paul's cultic atonement metaphors', p. 117 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'On the other hand, the New Testament leaves no doubt that atonement is accomplished through the believer’s participation with the Lord in his death rather than merely by Christ’s death on the cross (Rom. 6:2, 6, 8; cf. Gal. 2:19–20).’ , ‘Atone, Atonement’, in Myers (ed.), ‘Eerdmans Bible Dictionary’, p. 106 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall &amp; Bayne, ‘A Participatory Model of the Atonement’, in Nagasawa &amp; Erik Wielenberg (eds.), ‘New Waves in Philosophy of Religion’, pp. 150-166 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices and worship ==
Christadelphians are organised into local congregations, that commonly call themselves ''[[ecclesia]]s'',&lt;ref name=&quot;hyndman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Hyndman  | first =Rob | title =The Christadelphians (Brothers and Sisters in Christ): Introducing a Bible-based Community | publisher =Bethel Publications | year =1999 | location =Beechworth, VIC | url =http://robjhyndman.com/christadelphians/ | isbn =81-87409-34-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is taken from usage in the New Testament&lt;ref&gt;e.g. see Greek of Acts 5:11; 7:38&lt;/ref&gt; and is Greek for ''gathering of those summoned''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ecclesia.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 03 Feb. 2009. Available here [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177746/Ecclesia]&lt;/ref&gt; Congregational worship, which usually takes place on Sunday, centres on the remembrance of the death and celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by the taking part in the &quot;memorial service&quot;. Additional meetings are often organised for worship, prayer, [[evangelism]] and Bible study.

Ecclesias are typically involved in evangelism in the form of public lectures on Bible teaching,&lt;ref&gt;Examples of lecture titles on [http://www.handsworth-cdelph.co.uk/ Handsworth Christadelphians] website&lt;/ref&gt; college-style seminars on reading the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.biblecourse.f9.co.uk/ Learn to Read the Bible Effectively]&lt;/ref&gt; and Bible Reading Groups. Correspondence courses&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.thisisyourbible.com/pages/course.php This is Your Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; are also used widely, particularly in areas where there is no established Christadelphian presence. Some ecclesias, organisations or individuals also preach through other media like video,&lt;ref&gt;For example: Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society (CALS) [http://www.christadelphian.org/videos.htm videos], Williamsburgh Christadelphian Foundation (WCF) [http://www.wcfoundation.org/res/videolauncher.htm videos], the Christadelphians of Southern California's [http://thisisyourbible.org/video.asp videos], and Christadelphian [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youpreach YouPreach] on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; podcasts&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://washwoodheath.thepositiveword.com/index.php?cat=Proclamation Washwood Heath] Christadelphians' podcasts, [http://biblestudypodcast.wordpress.com Bible Study Podcasts] and [http://www.searchforhope.org/podcasts Search for Hope] podcasts.&lt;/ref&gt; and internet forums.&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.openbibleforum.org/forums/index.php?act=home Open Bible Forum], [http://www.thechristadelphians.org/forums/ Bible Discussion Forum] and [http://www.btdf.org/forums/ Bible Truth Discussion Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only baptised believers are considered members of the ecclesia. However, the children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian [[Sunday Schools]] and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings. Many ecclesias organise holidays for young people, the most popular form in the UK being [[camping]] holidays.

Christadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God's sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members. Women are typically not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the ecclesia when male believers are present, and do not sit on the main ecclesial arranging committees. They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children, other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities.

There are ecclesially-accountable committees for co-ordinated evangelism, youth and Sunday School work, [[military service]] issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study. 

Christadelphians refuse to participate in any military because they are [[conscientious objectors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gospelandstrife&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Norris | first =Alfred | title =The Gospel and Strife | publisher =Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/norris_gospelandstrife.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warandpolitics&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Watkins | first =Peter | title =War and Politics: The Christian's Duty | publisher =Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/watkins_warandpoliticsthechristiansduty.doc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While Christadelphians are not pacifists and say the time will come when military coercion and conflict will be required to establish Christ's kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;  

There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading and study&lt;ref&gt;'They are characterized by holding a firm belief in the inspired status of the Bible and place enormous emphasis upon biblical study', Evans, John S, 'The Prophecies of Daniel 2', page 251, USA:Xulon Press (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Christadelphian devotion centers on daily Bible study and weekly meetings', page 421, Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey W, 'The Encyclopedia of Christianity', USA:Wm.

=== Hymnody and music ===
Christadelphians are a [[liturgy|non-liturgical]] denomination. Christadelphian ecclesias are autonomous and free to adopt whatever pattern of worship they choose. However, in the English-speaking world, there tends to be a great deal of uniformity in order of service and [[hymn]]ody. 

Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and British Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more British than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the [[Psalter|Scottish Psalter]] and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[John Newton]].  Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.&lt;ref&gt;'Hymnody was an important part of Christadelphianism from its beginning, and, along with the journal, The Christadelphian, gave independent ecclesias a broader fellowship. Hymns reflected the essential doctrines and principles of their faith. These principles were anti-Trinitarianism. They also believed that God would establish his kingdom on earth through the return of Jesus to reign a thousand years in Jerusalem', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest hymn book published was the &quot;Sacred Melodist&quot; which was published by [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] in Geneva, Illinois in 1860. The next was the hymn book published for the use of ''Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God'' (an early name for Christadelphians&lt;ref name = &quot;anrvrv&quot;&gt;Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;) by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]] published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called ''The Golden Harp'' (which was subtitled &quot;Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in 'The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ'&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced only five years later by the first &quot;Christadelphian Hymn Book&quot; (1869), compiled by J. J. and A. Andrew,&lt;ref&gt;Ambassador of the Coming Age Vol. 6, P. 148&lt;/ref&gt; and this was revised and expanded in 1874, 1932 and 1964. A thorough revision by the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association resulted in the latest (2002) edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/acatalog/2002HymnBooks.html |title=The CMPA online bookshop |publisher=Thechristadelphian.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is almost universally used by English-speaking Christadelphian ecclesias. In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books. 

A more contemporary worship style is now popular in some quarters. The ''Praise the Lord'' songbook&lt;ref&gt;''Praise the Lord'' (Hoddesdon Christadelphian Service, 1993, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available.  This book is either used as a supplement to the more traditional Hymn Book or is used in place of the traditional Hymn Book. 

In the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bands&lt;ref&gt;An example is the Christadelphian folk rock band [[Fisher's Tale]] (albeit this is a witness project as opposed to being for the purpose of church worship)&lt;/ref&gt; and the establishment of the Christadelphian Arts Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catonline.org |title=Christadelphian Arts Trust |publisher=Catonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.

In other countries, hymnbooks have been produced in local languages,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Liedboek van de Broeders in Christus'' (Holland, circa 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture.  It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.&lt;ref&gt;'Considering the scope of hymnic literature by Christadelphians, we might conclude that few branches of Christianity can claim such a close relationship between hymn writing and their own religious development, and such a high percentage of hymnists in their membership.  As their hymns become better known, this close relationship will reveal that the heritage and faith of Christadelphians has been enhanced through a strong emphasis on hymnody, from their beginnings to the present day', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RG-59.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coaxial cable]] is often used to transmit '''cable television''' into a residence.]]
'''Cable television''' is a system of providing [[television]] to consumers via [[radio frequency]] signals transmitted to televisions through [[coaxial cable]]s or Digital light pulses though fixed [[optical fiber]]s located on the subscriber's property, much like the over-the-air method used in [[Terrestrial television|traditional television broadcasting]] (via radio waves) in which a television antenna is required.  [[FM radio]] programming, [[high-speed Internet]], [[telephony]], and similar non-television services may also be provided. The major difference is the change of radio frequency signals used and optical connections to the subscriber property.

The abbreviation '''CATV''' is often used to mean &quot;Cable TV&quot;.  It originally stood for '''Community Antenna Television''', from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large &quot;community antennas&quot; were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable ''broadcasting'' are even older as radio programming was [[Linjesender|distributed by cable]] in some European cities as far back as 1924.

It is most commonplace in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[East Asia]], though it is present in many other countries, mainly in [[South America]] and the [[Middle East]]. Cable TV has had little success in [[Africa]], as it is not cost-effective to lay cables in sparsely populated areas. So-called &quot;wireless cable&quot; or [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service|microwave]]-based systems are used instead.

==Cable television deployments==
===Asia &amp; Australia===
====Australia====
Cable television began in the early 1990s in Australia. Several companies appeared including FOXTEL, Galaxy TV, OPTUS TV, Selectv and Austar offering services to homes across the major states of Australia. Services to Tasmania and the Northern Territory took longer to start, not until the mid 2000's when the digital satellite pay television service had picked up momentum and was beginning to be used for metropolitan installs and not just rural installs. As FOXTEL and Austar subscribers continued to rise, Galaxy TV ended their services, while Selectv has become a Greek dedicated Satellite service. OPTUS TV in 2011 will cease their services.

====Philippines====
“NUVUE”, the first cable television system, was set up in Baguio City spearheaded by American expatriate Russel Swartley in 1969. Popularity of CATV started in the 1980s after the Marcos administration. Cable giant [[SkyCable]] started in 1992. Cable providers have grown, and these some examples are [[Global Destiny Cable|Global Destiny]], [[Cablelink]], and some regional cable providers. In 2007, SkyCable introduced the DigiBox, a cable TV set-top box that provides a digital television ([[Digital television|DTV]]) signal for higher video quality and prevents illegal cable TV connections. In 2008, SkyCable also broadcast the [[2008 Ryder Cup|37th Ryder Cup]] in [[High-definition television|HDTV]]. In 2009, SkyCable became the first cable TV service provider in the Philippines to broadcast the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]] Games in [[High-definition television|HDTV]] via the new SkyHD Cable TV service.

====Mongolia====
There are several cable TV providers in Mongolia.  The main three are &quot;SuperVision&quot;, &quot;Hiimori&quot; and &quot;Sansar CATV&quot;. All three cover approximately 15 national channels and 40 foreign channels, such as CNN, BBC, and NHK. &quot;Sansar&quot; has biggest network in Ulaanbaatar. SuperVision is the first digital cable television in Mongolia and other CATVs are planning to launch digital cable television with CA systems.

====Maldives====
There are only two cable TV operators in the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As the population of the Maldives is separated across around 200 inhabited islands, there is a cable TV operator for nearly every island. [[MediaNet]] Pvt. Ltd. is the country's largest cable TV operator (providing only analog service, although digital service has been announced. MediaNet is a Male-based cable TV operator that provides cable and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service ([[MMDS]]) service to five islands near Male. MediaNet holds a distribution license for 75 channels and distributes channels to nearly all the operators of the country. In Maldives, cable TV subscribers can get most [[Pay television|premium]] channels available in [[Asia]].

All channels are required to obtain an exhibition license from Department of Information after each channel is classified at [http://nbc.gov.mv/app.php '''National Bureau of Classification (NBC)''']. NBC gives the highest classification for every channel after contents of each channel are examined for a week. Cable TV classification ratings are as follows:

[[Image:NBC channel stickers.jpg]]

*'''G'''    - General viewing for all ages.
*'''PG'''   - Parental Guidance is required.
*'''12+'''  - For viewers aged 12 and above.
*'''15+'''  - For viewers aged 15 and above.
*'''18+'''  - For viewers aged 18 and above.
*'''18+R''' - For viewers aged 18 and above.

Channels with an '''18+R''' classification rating contains content that may affect an individual directly or indirectly. Viewers discretion is advised.

=== Latin America ===
====Panamá====
Panamanian company Rexa started Cable TV deployment in 1983. Rexa's successor, Cableonda, was dominant throughout the 1990s, but as the customer base expanded, other companies entered the market. Since 2000 several companies compete for the Panamanian market, such as CTV, Cable Onda, Cablevision, Cable and Wireless, and others. Cable Onda is the largest. The penetration of CableTV in Panamá is at 40%.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

====Dominican Republic====
Cable television in the [[Dominican Republic]] is provided by a variety of companies. These companies offer both English and Spanish language television, plus a range of channels in other languages, [[High-definition television|high definition]] channels, [[pay-per-view]] movies and events, sports packages and [[Pay television|premium]] movie channels such as [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO]], [[Playboy TV]], [[Cinecanal]], etc. Also, the channels are from not only the Dominican Republic, but also the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the Dominican Republic television spectrum, there are 46 [[VHF]], [[UHF]], and [[free-to-air]] (FTA) channels. The free of charge channels programming consists mainly of locally produced entertainment shows, news, and comedy shows; and foreign sit-coms, soap operas, movies, cartoons, and sports programs.

The main service provider in the Dominican Republic is Telecable from Tricom. Aster is concentrated in Santo Domingo, but is expanding its service throughout the Dominican Republic. There are also new companies using new technologies that are expanding quickly such as Claro TV ([[IPTV]]), Wind Telecom ([[MMDS]]) and [[SKY Latin America|SKY]] ([[Satellite TV]]).

===Europe===
====Ireland====

{{main | Cable Television in Ireland}}

Cable television is the most common{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} system for distributing multi-channel television in Ireland. With more than 40 year of history and extensive networks of both wired and &quot;wireless&quot; cable, Ireland is amongst the most cabled countries in Europe. Forty percent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comreg.ie/publications/default.asp?S=&amp;NavID=&amp;ctype=5&amp;NID=102445 Commission for Communications Regulation]&lt;/ref&gt; of Irish homes received cable television in September 2006. The figure dropped slightly in the early years of the 21st century due to the increased popularity of satellite reception, notably [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]], but has stabilized recently.

In the Republic of Ireland, [[UPC Ireland]] is by far the largest cable and MMDS operator, owning all of the state's MMDS licenses and almost all of the state's cable TV operators. UPC offers analogue and digital cable television services in cities and towns throughout the country (with the exception of Cork, where the network is digital-only). It offers MMDS services in rural areas. In areas previously served by NTL, the network is digital-only, while Chorus areas still have both analogue and digital services. Other than UPC, the only other operator providing analogue and digital cable is Casey Cablevision, which operates in [[Dungarvan]], [[County Waterford]]. There also exists a small number of analogue-only cable networks such as the [[Longford]] service Crossan Cable.

====United Kingdom====
When the infant [[BBC Television]] service was started in 1932, [[Rediffusion]], which had supplied cable radio services since 1928, started providing &quot;Pipe TV&quot; to its customers who had difficulties tuning into the weak TV broadcast signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/tvh/history/history.php A short history of Rediffusion by Russ J Graham]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspended during World War II, the BBC service was re-established in June 1946, and had only one transmitter, at [[Alexandra Palace]], which served the London area.  From the end of 1949, new transmitters were steadily opened to serve other major conurbations, and then smaller areas of population.  The areas on the fringes of the transmitter coverage provided an opportunity for [[Rediffusion]] and other commercial companies to expand cable systems to enlarge the viewing audience for the one [[BBC]] television channel which then existed.  The first was in Gloucester in 1950&lt;ref&gt;2008 Aldrich MJ ''[http://www.aldricharchive.com/cable_systems.html History of UK Cable]'', Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton&lt;/ref&gt; and the process gathered pace over the next few years, especially after a second television channel, [[ITV]], was launched in 1955 to compete with BBC.  By the late 1970s, two and a half million British homes received their television service via cable.&lt;ref&gt;1982 Aldrich MJ co-author ''Cable Systems'' p18 HMSO London ISBN 0-11-630821-4&lt;/ref&gt;

By law, these cable systems were restricted to the relay of the public broadcast channels, which meant that as the transmitter network became more comprehensive, the incentive to subscribe to cable was reduced and they began to lose customers.  In 1982, a radical liberalization of the law on cable was proposed by the Information Technology Advisory Panel,&lt;ref&gt;2008 Aldrich MJ ''The Cable Story'' Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton [http://www.aldricharchive.com/cable_story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; for the sake of promoting a new generation of [[broadband]] cable systems leading to the wired society&lt;ref&gt;1982 Aldrich MJ co-author ''Cable Systems'' HMSO London ISBN 0-11-630821-4&lt;/ref&gt; After setting up and receiving the conclusions of the Hunt Inquiry into Cable Expansion and Broadcasting Policy, the Government decided to proceed with liberalization and two pieces of legislation: the Cable and Broadcasting Act and the Telecommunications Act, were enacted in 1984.

The result was that cable systems were permitted to carry as many new television channels as they liked, as well as providing a telephone service and interactive services of many kinds (as since made familiar by the Internet).  To maintain the momentum of the perceived commercial interest in this new investment opportunity, in 1983, the Government itself granted eleven interim franchises for new broadband systems each covering a community of up to around 100,000 homes, but the competitive franchising process was otherwise left to the new regulatory body, the [[Cable Authority]], which took on its powers from January 1, 1985.

The franchising process proceeded steadily, but the actual construction of new systems was slow, as doubts about an adequate payback from the substantial investment persisted.  By the end of 1990 almost 15 million homes had been included in franchised areas, but only 828,000 of these had been passed by broadband cable and only 149,000 were actually subscribing.&lt;ref&gt;Cable Authority, Final Report and Accounts 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, however, construction accelerated and take-up steadily improved.

The first new television channels launched for carriage on cable systems (going live in March 1984) were [[Sky1|Sky Channel]], [[Screensport]], [[Music Box (TV channel)|Music Box]] and [[TEN - the Movie Channel]].  Others followed, some were merged or closed down, but the range expanded.  A similar flux was seen among the operators of cable systems:  franchises were granted to a host of different companies, but a process of consolidation saw the growth of large multiple system operators, until by the early 2000s, virtually the whole industry was in the hands of two companies, [[NTL:Telewest|NTL]] and [[Telewest]].

In 2005, it was announced that NTL and Telewest would merge, after a period of co-operation in the preceding few years. This merger was completed on March 3, 2006, with the company being named '''ntl Incorporated'''. For the time being, the two brand names and services were marketed separately.  However, following NTL's acquisition of [[Virgin Mobile]], the NTL and Telewest services were rebranded ''[[Virgin Media]]'' on February 8, 2007, creating a single cable operator covering more than 95% of the UK cable market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

There are a small number of other surviving cable television companies in the UK outside of NTL including [[WightCable]] ([[Isle of Wight]]) and [[Smallworld Cable|Smallworld]] ([[Ayrshire]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]] and [[Lancashire]]).

Cable TV faces intense competition from [[British Sky Broadcasting]]'s [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] [[satellite television]] service.  Most channels are carried on both platforms.  However, cable often lacks &quot;interactive&quot; features (e.g. text services, and extra video-screens), especially on BSkyB owned channels, and the satellite platform lacks services requiring high degrees of two-way communication, such as true [[video on demand]].

However, subscription-funded [[digital terrestrial television]] proved less of a competitive threat. The first system, [[ITV Digital]], went into liquidation in 2002. [[Top Up TV]] later replaced it; however, this service is shrinking{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} as the [[DVB-T]] multiplex owners are finding free-to-air broadcasting more profitable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Another potential source of competition in the future will be TV over broadband internet connections; this is known as Internet Protocol television ([[IPTV]]). Some IPTV services are currently available in [[London]], while services operated in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] ceased in April 2006.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As the speed and availability of broadband connections increase, more TV content can be delivered using protocols such as IPTV. However, its impact on the market is yet to be measured, as is consumer attitude toward watching TV programs on [[personal computer|computers]] instead of television sets.  At the end of 2006, BT (the UK's former state owned monopoly phone company) started offering [[BT Vision]], which combines the digital free-to-air standard [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]] through an aerial, and on-demand IPTV, delivered over a BT Broadband connection through the Vision set-top box (BT have chosen to deploy Microsoft's Mediaroom platform for this.){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===North America===
====Canada====

{{See|Multichannel television in Canada}}

In 1949, Broadcast Relay Service began negotiations for the implementation of what was to be the first large scale cable TV system in North America.
The development of the system relied on reaching agreement with Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission to utilise their existing network of power poles supplying power to the Montreal Metro area.
Initial discussions began with a meeting with Montreal City Council on June 21, 1949.  After many months if negotiation agreement was reached between Hydro Quebec and [[Rediffusion]] on February 28, 1950 for an initial 5 year period.
The Rediffusion cable system was operational in 1952 and eventually supplied 80,000 homes in Montreal Quebec.
Cable television in Canada began in 1952 with community antenna connections in [[Vancouver]] and [[London, Ontario]]; which city is first is not clear. Initially, the systems brought American stations to viewers in Canada who had no Canadian stations to watch; broadcast television, though begun late in 1952 in Toronto and Montreal, did not reach a majority of cities until 1954.

In time, cable television was widely established to carry available Canadian stations as well as import American stations, which constituted the vast majority of signals on systems (usually only one or two Canadian stations, while some systems had duplicate or even triplicate coverage of American networks). During the 1970s, a growing number of Canadian stations pushed American channels off the systems, forcing several to expand beyond the original 12-channel system configurations. At the same time, the advent of fibre-optic technology enabled companies to extend their systems to nearby towns and villages that by themselves were not viable cable television markets.

===== Fee structure =====
{{update|section|date=May 2010}}
The industry strongly lobbies against federal &quot;family tier&quot; and &quot;[[a la carte cable television]]&quot; bills which would provide consumers the option of purchasing individual channels rather than a broad tier of programming, sometimes consisting of channels which are not desired by various subscriber segments. These anti-consumer issues continue to garner attention from state governments, Congress and U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) Chairman [[Kevin J. Martin|Kevin Martin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://projects.publicintegrity.org/telecom/search/profile.aspx?id=M000018&lt;/ref&gt; What's more, the argument calling for an adjustment to the manner in which cable is distributed was reaffirmed in January 2010 when cable subscribers throughout [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York]] found themselves in the middle of a contentious battle over an increase in subscriber fees paid to the media company [[Scripps Networks Interactive]] by cable provider Cablevision. The parties' contract expired December 31, 2009, and as they were unable to reach a mutual agreement beforehand regarding the amount paid for each cable subscriber, Scripps pulled two of its television channels, [[HGTV]] and [[Food Network]], from the Cablevision channel lineup on January 1, 2010 at 12:01AM as the [[2010s]] had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.aol.com/2010/01/04/why-you-cant-watch-food-network-and-hgtv-on-cablevision/?icid=main|main|dl2|link1|http%3A%2F%2Finsidetv.aol.com%2F2010%2F01%2F04%2Fwhy-you-cant-watch-food-network-and-hgtv-on-cablevision%2F Why You Can't Watch Food Network and HGTV on Cablevision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstribune.com/articles/2010/01/06/entertainment/nt361ent10cablevisionscripps10.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multichannel.com/article/442389-Analyst_Scripps_Fight_Shouldn_t_Hurt_Cablevision.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wcbstv.com/local/food.network.hgtv.2.1404617.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cable-based services==
Coaxial cables are capable of bi-directional carriage of signals as well as the transmission of large amounts of [[data]]. Cable television signals use only a portion of the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as [[cable internet]], [[cable telephony]] and wireless services, using both unlicensed and licensed spectrum.

Broadband Internet is achieved over coaxial cable by using [[cable modem]]s to convert the [[television network|network]] data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog telephone modem to provide for the upstream connection. This limited the upstream speed to 31.2k and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides. Many large cable systems have upgraded or are upgrading their equipment to allow for bi-directional signals, thus allowing for greater upload speed and always-on convenience, though these upgrades are expensive.

In [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]] many cable operators have already introduced [[cable telephone]] service, which operates just like existing fixed line operators.  This service involves installing a special telephone interface at the customer's premises that converts the analog signals from the customer's in-home wiring into a digital signal, which is then sent on the [[local loop]] (replacing the analog [[last mile]], or [[Plain old telephone service]] (POTS) to the company's switching center, where it is connected to the Public switched telephone network ([[PSTN]]). The biggest obstacle to cable telephone service is the need for nearly 100% reliable service for emergency calls. One of the standards available for digital cable telephony, [[PacketCable]], seems to be the most promising and able to work with the [[Quality of Service]] (QOS) demands of traditional analog POTS service. The biggest advantage to digital cable telephone service is similar to the advantage of digital cable TV, namely that data can be compressed, resulting in much less bandwidth used than a dedicated analog circuit-switched service. Other advantages include better voice quality and integration to a [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) network providing cheap or unlimited nationwide and international calling. Note that in many cases, digital cable telephone service is separate from [[cable modem]] service being offered by many cable companies and does not rely on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) traffic or the Internet.

Beginning in 2004 in the United States, the traditional cable television providers and traditional telecommunication companies increasingly compete in providing voice, video and data services to residences.  The combination of TV, telephone and Internet access is commonly called '''[[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]''' regardless of whether CATV or [[Telephone company|telcos]] offer it.

More recently, several US cable operators have begun offering wireless services to their subscribers. Most notably was the September 2008 launch of Optimum Wi-Fi by Cablevision. This service is made available, at no additional cost, to Optimum Broadband subscribers, and is available at over 14,000 locations across Long Island, NY, parts of NJ and CT. Cablevision has reported a double digit reduction in subscriber churn since launching Optimum Wi-Fi, even as Verizon has rolled out FiOS, a competitive residential broadband service in the Cablevision footprint. Other Tier 1 cable operators, including Comcast, have announced trials of a similar service in sections of the US Northeast.

==History and beginnings of Cable TV-originated live programs==
During the 1980s, mandated regulations not unlike [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channels created the beginning of the Cable-originated live TV program that evolved into what we know today in 2011 where many cable networks provide live cable-only broadcasts of many varieties, cable-only produced movies, and mini-series.  Various live local programs with local interests were rapidly being created all over the United States in most major markets in the early 1980s.  One of the first was with the local ATC broadcasting station in Columbus, Ohio, the company being based in Colorado at the time, where, in 1982, at the age of 16, while still in high school, Richard Sillman was one of if not the youngest Cable TV Director in the US of these live on-air Cable TV programs.

With the development of the internet, by the late 1990s and early 2000, much of that regulation had been replaced where newer industry technologies developed, offering viewers alternate choices for local events and programming leading to what is today, that being Digital Cable, Internet, and Phone being offered to consumers, bundled, by 2010.

'''Cholera''' is an [[infection]] of the [[small intestine]] that is caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. The main symptoms are profuse watery [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]]. Transmission is primarily through consuming contaminated drinking water or food. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte]] imbalance. Primary treatment is with [[oral rehydration solution]] and if these are not tolerated, intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are beneficial in those with severe disease.  Worldwide it affects 3-5 million people and causes 100,000-130,000 deaths a year {{As of|2010|lc=on}}. Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] methods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:PHIL 1939 lores.jpg|thumb|A person with severe dehydration due to cholera. Note the sunken eyes and decreased skin turgor which produces wrinkled hands]]
The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse painless [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] of clear fluid.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; These symptoms usually start suddenly, one to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; The diarrhea is frequently described as &quot;rice water&quot; in nature and may have a fishy odor.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; An untreated person with cholera may produce 10-20 liters of diarrhea a day&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; with fatal results. For every symptomatic person there are 3 to 100 people who get the infection but remain asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=King AA, Ionides EL, J.Luckhurst, Bouma MJ |title=Inapparent infections and cholera dynamics |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7206 |pages=877–80 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18704085 |doi=10.1038/nature07084 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the severe diarrhea and vomiting are not aggressively treated it can, within hours, result in life-threatening [[dehydration]] and electrolyte imbalances.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; The typical symptoms of dehydration include low [[blood pressure]], poor skin
turgor (wrinkled hands), sunken eyes, and a rapid pulse.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt;

About one&amp;nbsp;hundred&amp;nbsp;million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; This dose, however, is less in those with lower [[gastric acid]]ity (for instance those using [[proton pump inhibitors]]).&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Children are also more susceptible with two to four year olds having the highest rates of infection.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their [[blood type]], with those with [[type O blood]] being the most susceptible.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harris JB, Khan AI, LaRocque RC, ''et al.'' |title=Blood group, immunity, and risk of infection with Vibrio cholerae in an area of endemicity |journal=Infect.

It has been said that [[cystic fibrosis]] genetic [[mutation]] in humans has maintained a selective advantage: [[heterozygous]] carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to ''V. cholerae'' infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertranpetit_1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertranpetit J, Calafell F |title=Genetic and geographical variability in cystic fibrosis: evolutionary considerations |journal=Ciba Found.

=== Transmission ===
Cholera is typically transmitted by either contaminated food or water. In the developed world, seafood is the usual cause, while in the developing world it is more often water.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Cholera has been found in only two other animal populations: [[shellfish]] and [[plankton]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt;

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as &quot;rice-water,&quot; contaminates water used by others, disease transmission may occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherris&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors)| title = Sherris Medical Microbiology| edition = 4th| pages = 376–7| publisher = McGraw Hill| year = 2004| isbn = 0838585299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways or into [[groundwater]] or drinking water supplies. Drinking any infected water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as [[shellfish]] living in the affected [[waterway]], can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person.  Both toxic and nontoxic strains exist. Nontoxic strains can acquire toxicity through a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Archivist_1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Archivist| title=Cholera phage discovery| journal=Arch Dis Child| year=1997| volume=76| page=274| url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/76/3/274| doi=10.1136/adc.76.3.274| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal cholera outbreaks typically follow [[algal bloom|zooplankton blooms]], thus making cholera a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] disease.

==Mechanism==

Most bacteria, when consumed, do not survive the acidic conditions of the [[stomach|human stomach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartwell&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=Hartwell LH, Hood L, Goldberg ML, Reynolds AE, Silver LM, and Veres RC| year=2004| title=Genetics: From genes to genomes| publisher=Mc-Graw Hill| location=Boston| pages=551–552, 572–574}} (using the turning off and turning on of [[gene expression]] to make toxin proteins in cholera bacteria as a &quot;comprehensive example&quot; of what is known about the mechanisms by which bacteria change the mix of proteins they manufacture to respond to the changing opportunities for surviving and thriving in different chemical environments).&lt;/ref&gt; The few bacteria that do survive conserve their [[nutrient|energy and stored nutrients]] during the passage through the stomach by shutting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the [[small intestine]], they need to propel themselves through the thick [[mucous membrane|mucus]] that lines the small intestine to get to the intestinal walls, where they can thrive. ''V. cholerae'' bacteria start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein [[flagellin]] to make [[flagella]], the cork-screw helical fibers they rotate to propel themselves through the mucus of the small intestine.

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the flagella propellers to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin, thus again conserving energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they manufacture in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.

The [[cholera toxin]] (CTX or CT) is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond.  The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to [[GM1]] [[ganglioside]]s on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells.  The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylates]] [[G protein]]s, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring.  Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis.  Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the  A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called [[ADP-ribosylation factor 6]] (Arf6).&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Neal C, Jobling M, Holmes R, Hol W |title=Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5737 |pages=1093–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16099990 |doi=10.1126/science.1113398 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the [[Gs alpha subunit]] of the [[heterotrimeric G protein]].  This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to secretion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin is introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by horizontal gene transfer.  Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called CTXf or CTXφ.

Microbiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiRita&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ |title=Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=88 |issue=12 |pages=5403–7 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=2052618 |pmc=51881 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.12.5403 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump [[chloride]] ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated if an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is not taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.

By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, [[mucous membrane|mucous]] layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered there is a complex cascade of regulatory proteins that control expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiRita&quot;/&gt; Current research aims at discovering &quot;the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DiRita&quot; /&gt;

===Genetic structure===
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of ''Vibrio cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lan R, Reeves PR |year=2002 |month= Jan|title=Pandemic Spread of Cholera: Genetic Diversity and Relationships within the Seventh Pandemic Clone of Vibrio cholerae Determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism |journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=172–181 |doi=10.1128/JCM.40.1.172-181.2002 |pmid=11773113 |issn=0095-1137 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11773113 |format=Free full text |pmc=120103 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid dip-stick test is available to determine the presence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name=NEJM2006/&gt; In those that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name=NEJM2006/&gt; In [[epidemic]] situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' [[serotype|serogroup]] O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.
Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC_Diag&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/top.pdf |title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |publisher=CDC | location=Atlanta, GA | format=PDF |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of special media have been employed for the cultivation for cholera vibrios. They are classified as follows:

===Enrichment media===
# ''Alkaline peptone water'' at pH 8.6
# ''Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water'' at pH 9.2

=== Plating media ===
# ''Alkaline bile salt agar (BSA)'': The colonies are very similar to those on [[agar|nutrient agar]].
# ''Monsur's gelatin Tauro cholate trypticase tellurite agar (GTTA) medium'': Cholera vibrios produce small translucent colonies with a greyish black center.
# ''TCBS medium'': This the mostly widely used medium; it contains thiosulphate, citrate, bile salts and sucrose. Cholera vibrios produce flat 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, yellow nucleated colonies.

Direct [[microscopy]] of stool is not recommended, as it is unreliable. Microscopy is preferred only after enrichment, as this process reveals the characteristic motility of ''Vibrio'' and its inhibition by appropriate [[antiserum|antisera]]. Diagnosis can be confirmed, as well, as serotyping done by [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with specific sera.

== Prevention ==
[[Image:Cholera hospital in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|[[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|Cholera hospital]] in [[Dhaka]], showing typical ''cholera beds''.]]
Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In [[developed countries]], due to nearly universal advanced [[water treatment]] and sanitation practices, cholera is no longer a major health threat. The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910-1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;moltke1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cholera Kills Boy.

There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:

* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of infected fecal waste water produced by cholera victims and all contaminated materials (e.g. clothing, bedding, etc.) is essential. All materials that come in contact with cholera patients should be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] by washing in hot water, using [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* Sewage: antibacterial treatment of general [[sewage]] by chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet light or other effective treatment before it enters the waterways or underground water supplies helps prevent undiagnosed patients from inadvertently spreading the disease.
* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, [[chlorination]], ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g. by [[solar water disinfection]]), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in [[Bangladesh]] that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

===Surveillance===
Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provide guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |title=Cholera: prevention and control |publisher=WHO |work=Health topics | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For prevention to be effective it is important that cases are reported to national health authorities.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt;

===Vaccine===
A number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available.&lt;ref name=WHO2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cochrane10&gt;{{cite journal |author=Graves PM, Deeks JJ, Demicheli V, Jefferson T |title=Vaccines for preventing cholera: killed whole cell or other subunit vaccines (injected) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=8 |pages=CD000974 |year=2010 |pmid=20687062 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000974.pub2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dukoral]], an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an efficacy of 85%, with minimal side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jelinek T, Kollaritsch H |title=Vaccination with Dukoral against travelers' diarrhea (ETEC) and cholera |journal=Expert Rev Vaccines |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=561–7 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18564011 |doi=10.1586/14760584.7.5.561 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in over 60 countries.

== Treatment ==
[[Image:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb|Cholera patient being treated by medical staff in 1992.]]

===Fluids===
In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with [[oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT),which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer.&lt;ref name=NEJM2006/&gt; Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency.&lt;ref name=NEJM2006/&gt; In severe cases with significant dehydration, [[intravenous]] rehydration may be necessary. [[Ringer's lactate]] is the preferred solution.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Ten percent of a person's body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; This method was first tried on a mass scale during a war in Pakistan, and was found to have much success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/03/21/the_civil_war_that_killed_cholera The Civil War That Killed Cholera], foreignpolicy.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

If commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made.  One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 8 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm|title=Oral Rehydration Solutions: Made at Home|year=2010|accessdate=2010-10-29|publisher=The Mother and Child Health and Education Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolytes===
As there frequently is initially [[acidosis]], the [[potassium]] level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt;

===Antibiotics===
[[Antibiotic]] treatments for one to three days shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; People will recover without them, however, if sufficient hydration is maintained.&lt;ref name=NEJM2006/&gt; [[Doxycycline]] is typically used first line, although some [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of ''V. cholerae'' have shown [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Other antibiotics that have been proven effective include [[cotrimoxazole]], [[erythromycin]], [[tetracycline]], [[chloramphenicol]], and [[furazolidone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprojects.mmi.mcgill.ca/tropmed/disease/chol/treatment.htm |title=Cholera treatment|publisher=Molson Medical Informatics |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluoroquinolone]]s, such as [[norfloxacin]], also may be used, but resistance has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krishna BV, Patil AB, Chandrasekhar MR |title=Fluoroquinolone-resistant Vibrio cholerae isolated during a cholera outbreak in India |journal=Trans.

It is estimated that cholera affects 3-5&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide, and causes 100,000-130,000&amp;nbsp;deaths a year as of 2010.&lt;ref name=WHO2010/&gt; This occurs mainly in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reidl J, Klose KE |title=Vibrio cholerae and cholera: out of the water and into the host |journal=FEMS Microbiol.

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the [[Americas]] for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century and seems likely to persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blake | first1 = PA | title = Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas. | journal = Gastroenterology clinics of North America | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 639–60 | year = 1993 | pmid = 7691740 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The word cholera is from {{lang-el|χολέρα}} ''kholera'' from χολή ''kholē'' &quot;bile&quot;. Cholera likely has its origins in the [[Indian subcontinent]]; it has been prevalent in the [[Ganges delta]] since ancient times.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; The disease first spread by trade routes (land and sea) to [[Russia]] in 1817, then to [[Western Europe]], and from Europe to [[North America]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; There have been seven cholera [[pandemic]]s in the past 200 years, with the seventh originating in [[Indonesia]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html Cholera's seven pandemics]&quot;. CBC News. October 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a local disease, cholera became one of the most widespread and deadly diseases of the 19th century, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;.Kelley Lee (2003) &quot;''Health impacts of globalization: towards global governance''&quot;. Palgrave Macmillan. p.131. ISBN 0333802543&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Russian Empire|Russia]] alone, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people had perished of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A.

Cholera became the first [[reportable disease]] in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], in 1854, was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water in its cause.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004/&gt; Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to [[water filtration|filtering]] and [[chlorination]] of water supplies, but still heavily affects populations in [[developing countries]].

In the past, people traveling in ships would hang a yellow [[quarantine]] flag if one or more of the crew members suffered from cholera. Passengers from boats with a yellow flag hung would not be allowed to disembark at any harbor for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sehdev PS |title=The origin of quarantine |journal=Clin.

=== Cholera morbus ===
The term ''cholera morbus'' was used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to describe both nonepidemic cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases (sometimes epidemic) that resembled cholera. The term is not in current use, but is found in many older references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antiquusmorbus.com/English/EnglishC.htm| title= Archaic medical terms| publisher=Antiquus Morbus| year=2007| accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other diseases are now known collectively as [[gastroenteritis]].

=== Research ===
The Russian-born bacteriologist [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed the first cholera vaccine around 1900. The bacterium had been originally isolated forty five years earlier (1855) by Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], but its exact nature and his results were not widely known.

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Charles E. |title=The cholera years: the United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=0-226-72677-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849.  In his major &quot;state of the art&quot; review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the [[etiology]] of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human [[sewage]] contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Dr John Snow, ''The mode of communication of cholera'', London 1855&lt;/ref&gt; His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next thirty years or so.

Cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s.  This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1885, [[Robert Koch]] identified ''V. cholerae'' with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease..

Cholera has been a laboratory for the study of evolution of virulence. The province of Bengal in [[British Raj|British India]] was partitioned into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] in 1947. Prior to partition, both regions had cholera pathogens with similar characteristics. After 1947, India made more progress on public health than East Pakistan (now [[Bangladesh]]). As a consequence,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} the strains of the pathogen that succeeded in India had a greater incentive in the longevity of the host.  They have become less virulent than the strains prevailing in Bangladesh.  These draw upon the resources of the host population and rapidly kill many victims.

More recently, in 2002, Alam, et al., studied stool samples from patients at the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease]] (ICDDR) in [[Dhaka, Bangladesh]]. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state.  Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the &quot;rice water&quot; stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merrell2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: doi=10.1038/nature00778 |author=Merrell DS, Butler SM, Qadri F, ''et al.'' |title=Host-induced epidemic spread of the cholera bacterium |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6889 |pages=642–5 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12050664 |pmc=2776822 |doi=10.1038/nature00778 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mount Mazama eruption timeline.PNG|thumb|right|Example of the formation of a caldera, the pictures show [[Mount Mazama]]'s eruption timeline]]

A '''caldera''' is a cauldron-like [[volcano|volcanic]] feature usually formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption, such as the one at [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the US. They are sometimes confused with [[volcanic crater]]s. The word comes from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''caldera'', and this from [[Latin]] &lt;small&gt;CALDARIA&lt;/small&gt;, meaning &quot;cooking pot&quot;. In some texts the English term ''[[cauldron]]'' is also used.

In 1815, the German geologist [[Leopold von Buch]] visited the Las Cañadas caldera of [[Teide]] on [[Tenerife]], and the [[Caldera de Taburiente]] on [[La Palma]], both in the [[Canary Islands]]. When he published his memoirs he introduced the term ''caldera'' into the geological vocabulary.

==Caldera formation==
[[File:Origin of volcanic caldera via analogue model.gif|thumb|left|Animation of analogue experiment showing origin of volcanic caldera in box filled with flour]]
A collapse is triggered by the emptying of the [[magma chamber]] beneath the volcano, usually as the result of a large [[volcano|volcanic eruption]]. If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the ''volcanic edifice'' above it. A roughly circular fracture, the ''ring fault'', develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions which are also known as ring dykes. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.

[[Image:Toba zoom.jpg|thumb|right|[[Landsat]] image of [[Lake Toba]], on the island of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. A [[resurgent dome]] formed the island of [[Samosir]]. (100 kilometres long and 30 kilometres wide, caldera of the world's largest class)]]

===Explosive calderas===
If the [[magma]] is rich in [[silica]], the caldera is often filled in with [[ignimbrite]], [[tuff]], [[rhyolite]], and other [[igneous rock]]s. Silica-rich magma does have a high [[viscosity]], and therefore does not flow easily like [[basalt]]. As a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the magma. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth, the rapid off-loading of overlying material causes the trapped gases to decompress rapidly, thus triggering explosive destruction of the magma and spreading [[volcanic ash]] over wide areas. The lava of explosive calderas is called [[A'a]]. Further [[lava]] flows may be erupted.

If volcanic activity continues, the centre of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a ''[[resurgent dome]]'' such as is seen at [[Galán|Cerro Galán]], [[Lake Toba]], [[Yellowstone]], and so on., by subsequent intrusion of magma. A ''silicic'' or ''rhyolitic caldera'' may erupt hundreds or even thousands of cubic kilometers of material in a single event. Even small caldera-forming eruptions, such as [[Krakatoa]] in 1883 or [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991, may result in significant local destruction and a noticeable drop in temperature around the world. Large calderas may have even greater effects.

When [[Yellowstone Caldera]] last erupted some 640,000 years ago, it released about 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material (as measured in dense rock equivalent (DRE)), covering a substantial part of [[North America]] in up to two metres of debris. By comparison, when [[Mount St. Helens]] erupted in 1980, it released ~1.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (DRE) of ejecta. The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the [[Lake Toba]] eruption in [[Indonesia]].

====Toba====

About 75,000 years ago, this Indonesian volcano released about 2,800 &lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; DRE of ejecta, the largest known eruption within the [[Quaternary]] Period (last 1.8 million years) and probably the largest explosive eruption within the last 25 million years. In the late 1990s, [[anthropologist]] Stanley Ambrose&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/people/ambrose Stanley Ambrose page at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that a [[volcanic winter]] induced by this eruption reduced the [[human]] population to about 2,000 - 20,000 individuals, resulting in a [[population bottleneck]] (''see'' [[Toba catastrophe theory]]). More recently several geneticists, including Lynn Jorde and [[Henry Harpending]] have proposed that the human race was reduced to approximately five to ten thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC2]], 3 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever figure is right, the fact remains that the human race seemingly came close to extinction about 75,000 years ago.

Eruptions forming even larger calderas are known, especially [[La Garita Caldera]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], where the 5,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Fish Canyon Tuff was blasted out in a major single eruption about 27.8 million years ago.

At some points in [[geological time]], rhyolitic calderas have appeared in distinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]] (erupted during the [[Tertiary Period]]) or the [[Saint Francois Mountain Range]] of [[Missouri]] (erupted during the [[Proterozoic]]).

===Non-explosive calderas===
Some volcanoes, such as [[shield volcano]]es [[Kīlauea]] and [[Mauna Loa]] (respectively the most active and the largest on Earth, both on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]), form calderas in a different fashion. The magma feeding these volcanoes is [[basalt]] which is silica poor. As a result, the magma is much less [[viscous]] than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano, and the magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by explosive events. The resulting calderas are also known as subsidence calderas, and can form more gradually than explosive calderas. For instance, the caldera atop [[Fernandina Island]] underwent a collapse in 1968, when parts of the caldera floor dropped 350 meters.&lt;ref name=gvp&gt;{{cite gvp | vnum=1503-01=&amp;volpage=photos&amp;photo=062078 | title=Fernandina: Photo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilauea]] Caldera has an inner crater known as Halema‘uma‘u, which has often been filled by a lava lake.

It is very frequent for a caldera to become emptied by drainage of melted lava through a breach on the caldera's rim. The [[Caldera de Taburiente]] and the Caldereta, both in the island of [[La Palma]] ([[Canary Islands]]), are '''calderas''' emptied by a river of lava some 500,000 years ago.

==Extraterrestrial calderas==
Since the early 1960s it has been known that volcanism exists on other planets and moons. Through the use of manned and unmanned spacecraft, volcanism has been discovered on [[Venus]], [[Mars]], the [[Moon]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]], a satellite of [[Jupiter]]. None of these orbs has [[plate tectonics]], which contributes approximately 60% of the Earth's volcanic activity (the other 40% attributed to hot spot volcanism) (Wilson 2008). Caldera structure is similar on all of these planetary bodies, though the size varies considerably. The average caldera diameter on Venus is 68&amp;nbsp;km. The average caldera diameter of Io is close to 40&amp;nbsp;km, and the mode is 6&amp;nbsp;km. [[Tvashtar Paterae]] is likely the largest caldera on Io with a diameter of 290&amp;nbsp;km. The average caldera diameter of Mars is 48&amp;nbsp;km, smaller than Venus. Calderas on Earth are the smallest of all planetary bodies and vary from 1.6 to 80&amp;nbsp;km as a maximum (Gottsmann 2008).

===The Moon===
The Moon has an outer shell of low density crystalline rock that is a few hundred kilometers thick, which formed due to a rapid creation. The craters of the moon have been well preserved through time and were once thought to have been the result of extreme volcanic activity, but instead were formed by meteorites, nearly all of which took place in the first few hundred million years after the Moon formed. Around 500 million years afterward, the Moon's mantle was able to be extensively melted due to the decay of radioactive elements. Massive basaltic eruptions took place generally at the base of large impact craters. Also, eruptions may have taken place due to a magma reservoir at the base of the crust. This forms a dome, possibly the same morphology of a shield volcano where calderas universally are known to form (Wilson 2008).

===Mars===
The volcanic activity of [[Mars]] is concentrated on two major provinces, [[Tharsis quadrangle|Tharsis]] and [[Elysium quadrangle|Elysium]]. Each province contains a series of giant shield volcanoes that are similar to what we see on Earth and likely are the result of mantle hot spots. The surfaces are dominated by lava flows, and all have one or more collapse calderas (Wilson 2008).

===Venus===
Because there are no plate tectonics on [[Venus]], heat is only lost by conduction through the lithosphere. This causes enormous lava flows, accounting for 80% of Venus' surface area. Many of the mountains are large shield volcanoes that range in size from 150–400&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and 2–4&amp;nbsp;km high. More than 80 of these large shield volcanoes have summit calderas averaging 60&amp;nbsp;km across (Wilson 2008).

===Io===
Io, unusually, is heated by solid flexing due to the [[Tidal force|tidal]] influence of [[Jupiter]] and the neighboring large moons [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Unlike any of the planets mentioned, Io is continuously volcanically active and contains many calderas with diameters tens of kilometers across (Wilson 2008).

==Mineralization==
Some calderas are known to host rich [[ore deposit]]s. One of the world's best preserved mineralized calderas is the [[Neoarchean]] [[Sturgeon Lake Caldera]] in [[northeastern Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/prc/workshops/S08workshop.html UMD: Precambrian Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TI-biju.jpg|thumb|A newer graphing calculator]]

An '''electronic calculator''' (usually called simply a '''calculator''') is a small, usually inexpensive electronic device used to perform the basic operations of [[arithmetic]]. Modern calculators are more portable than most [[computer]]s, though most [[Personal digital assistants|PDAs]] are comparable in size to handheld calculators.

The first electronic calculator was created in the 1960s, building on the history of tools such as the abacus, developed around 2000 BC; and the [[mechanical calculator]], developed in the 17th century. It was developed in parallel with the [[analog computer]]s of the day. 

Pocket-sized devices become available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004|invention of the microprocessor]] developed serendipitously by [[Intel]] for a [[Busicom]] calculator.

Modern calculators are electrically powered (usually by battery and/or [[solar cell]]) and vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card sized models to sturdy adding machine-like models with built-in printers. They first became popular in the late 1960s as decreasing size and cost of electronics made possible devices for calculations, avoiding the use of scarce and expensive computer resources. By the 1980s, calculator prices had reduced to a point where a basic calculator was affordable to most. By the 1990s they had become common in math classes in schools, with the idea that students could be freed from basic calculations and focus on the concepts.

Computer operating systems as far back as [[Ancient UNIX Systems|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator programs such as [[dc (Unix)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[Personal digital assistant|PDA-type]] devices (save a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices).

In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets; for example, there are [[scientific calculator]]s which focus on operations slightly more complex than those specific to arithmetic – for instance, [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [[computer algebra]]. [[Graphing calculator]]s can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. They often serve other purposes, however.

== Design ==
[[File:CalculatorFractions-5550x.jpg|thumb|Scientific calculator displays of fractions and decimal equivalents]]

Modern electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations. Some even contain 00 and 000 buttons to make large numbers easier to enter.

Fractions such as {{math|{{frac|1|3}}}} are displayed as decimal approximations, for example rounded to {{math|0.33333333}}. Also, some fractions such as {{math|{{frac|1|7}}}} which is {{math|0.14285714285714}} (to 14 [[significant figures]]) can be difficult to recognize in decimal form; as a result, many scientific calculators are able to work in [[vulgar fraction]]s and/or [[mixed number]]s.

In most countries, [[student]]s use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic skills]] would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations &quot;in the head&quot;, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[estimation]] techniques and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Bing, Edward F. Redish, [http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1187 Symbolic Manipulators Affect Mathematical Mindsets], December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Calculators versus computers ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

The fundamental difference between a calculator and [[computer]] is that a computer can be [[Computer program|programmed]] in a way that allows the program to take different [[Branch on condition|branches according to intermediate results]], while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions such as addition, multiplication, and logarithms built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functionality, sometimes with support for programming languages such as [[RPL programming language|RPL]] or [[TI-BASIC]].

Typically the user buys the least expensive model having a specific feature set, but does not care much about speed (since speed is constrained by how fast the user can press the buttons). Thus designers of calculators strive to minimize the number of logic elements on the chip, not the number of clock cycles needed to do a computation.

For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement [[floating point]] mathematics with code in [[Read-only memory|ROM]], and compute trigonometric functions with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because CORDIC does not require hardware floating-point. [[Bit serial]] logic designs are more common in calculators whereas [[bit parallel]] designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity, but takes many more clock cycles. (Again, the line blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, particularly the [[Z80]], [[MC68000]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures, as well as some custom designs specifically made for the calculator market.)

==History==
{{See also|Mechanical calculator#History}}

===Precursors to the electronic calculator===

The first known tool used in the aid of arithmetic calculation was the [[Abacus]], devised by mathematicians in Egypt in 2000 BC. A more recent development was the [[slide rule]], invented around in the 1620s by [[Edmund Gunter]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

1642 saw the invention of the first [[mechanical calculator]] (called the Pascaline) by [[Blaise Pascal]] in [[France]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin (1994)]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the [[United States]]. 

The [[Curta calculator]] was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

=== The development of electronic calculators ===
The first [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, using firstly [[vacuum tube]]s and later [[transistor]]s in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.

In 1954 [[IBM]], in the [[U.S.]], demonstrated a large all-[[transistor]] calculator and, in 1957, the company released the first ''commercial'' all-transistor calculator, the [[IBM 608]], though it was housed in several cabinets and cost about $80,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV2214.html IBM Archives: IBM 608 calculator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Casio|Casio Computer Co.]], in [[Japan]], released the Model ''14-A'' calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) &quot;compact&quot; calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on [[relay]] technology, and was built into a desk.

In October 1961 the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the British [[Bell Punch]]/Sumlock Comptometer [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] ('''A''' '''N'''ew '''I'''nspiration '''T'''o '''A'''rithmetic/'''A'''ccounting) was announced.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Simple and Silent&quot;, ''Office Magazine'', December 1961, p1244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Anita' der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat&quot; [trans: &quot;the first portable electronic computer&quot;], ''Buromaschinen Mechaniker'', November 1961, p207&lt;/ref&gt; This machine used [[vacuum tube]]s, cold-cathode tubes and [[Dekatron]]s in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [[Nixie tube|&quot;Nixie&quot;]]-type tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical [[comptometer]]s of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] CS-10A among electronic calculators. Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names &quot;Plus&quot; and &quot;Sumlock&quot;, and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British [[Pilot ACE]] computer project, to lead the development. The [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

The tube technology of the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, 13-digit capacity on a 5-inch [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], and introduced [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[CS-10A]], which weighed 25&amp;nbsp;kg (55&amp;nbsp;lb) and cost 500,000 yen (~US$2500), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).

There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, [[Olivetti]], SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early scalculators used hundreds of [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]], which were cheaper than [[Transistor#Semiconductor material|silicon transistor]]s, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], cold-cathode [[Nixie tube]]s, and [[filament lamp]]s. Memory technology was usually based on the [[delay line memory]] or the [[magnetic core memory]], though the Toshiba &quot;Toscal&quot; BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of [[dynamic RAM]] built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

The [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop electronic calculating machine programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The [[Olivetti]] Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.

The ''[[Monroe Epic]]'' programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.

The first handheld calculator was developed by [[Texas Instruments]] in 1967. It could add, multiply, subtract, and divide, and its output device was a paper tape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/nonProductSingle/about_press_release_news37.html Texas Instruments Celebrates the 35th Anniversary of Its Invention of the Calculator] [[Texas Instruments]] press release, 15 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14845433 Electronic Calculator Invented 40 Years Ago] All Things Considered, NPR, 30 September 2007. Audio interview with one of the inventors.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s to mid-1980s===
[[Image:LED DISP.JPG|thumb|right|Early calculator [[LED]] display.]]
The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of [[transistors]] on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer [[integrated circuits]] (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of [[semiconductor]] development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in Large Scale Integration (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] with [[Texas Instruments]], [[Sharp Corporation|Hayakawa Electric]] (later known as Sharp Corporation) with [[Rockwell International|North-American Rockwell Microelectronics]], [[Busicom]] with [[Mostek]] and [[Intel]], and [[General Instrument]] with [[Sanyo]].

==== Pocket calculators ====

[[File:Casio cm602.jpg|thumb|The CASIO CM-602 Mini Electronic Calculator provided basic functions in the 1970s]]

By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the [[Sanyo]] ICC-0081 &quot;Mini Calculator&quot;, the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] Pocketronic, and the [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] [[Sharp QT-8B|QT-8B]] &quot;micro Compet&quot;. The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the &quot;Cal-Tech&quot; project which had been started at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the &quot;Cal-Tech&quot; project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.

Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the [[Sharp EL-8]], also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed about one pound, had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable [[NiCad]] batteries, and initially sold for $395.

However, the efforts in [[integrated circuit development]] culminated in the introduction in early 1971 of the first &quot;calculator on a chip&quot;, the MK6010 by [[Mostek]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line&quot;, ''Electronics's', February 1, 1971, p19&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very expensive, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the [[vacuum fluorescent display]], [[LED]], and [[LCD]]), lead within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.

In 1971 [[Pico Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Instrument]] also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a complete single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.

The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the [[Busicom]] LE-120A &quot;HANDY&quot;, which was marketed early in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning&quot;, Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an [[LED]] display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a &quot;calculator on a chip&quot;), the [[Mostek]] MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures 4.9x2.8x0.9 in (124x72x24 mm).

The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly referred to as ''The Bowmar Brain''), measuring 5.2×3.0×1.5 in (131×77×37&amp;nbsp;mm), came out in the fall of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function [[Sinclair Executive]] became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring 5.4×2.2×0.35 in (138×56×9&amp;nbsp;mm) and weighing 2.5&amp;nbsp;oz (70g). It retailed for around $150 ([[Pound Sterling|GB£]]79). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than $10 (GB£5).

The first Soviet-made pocket-sized calculator, the &quot;Elektronika B3-04&quot; was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the beginning of 1974.

[[File:SinclairExecutive-01.jpg|thumb|the 1972 [[Sinclair Executive]] pocket calculator]]

One of the first low-cost calculators was the [[Sinclair Cambridge]], launched in August 1973. It retailed for {{£|29.95}}, or £5 less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design was flawed and their accuracy in some functions was questionable. The scientific programmable models were particularly poor in this respect, with the programmability coming at a heavy price in [[Transcendental function]] accuracy.{{Or|date=May 2010}}

Meanwhile [[Hewlett Packard|Hewlett Packard (HP)]] had been developing its own pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972 it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions that could replace a [[slide rule]]. The $395 [[HP-35]], along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like &quot;8 plus 5&quot; is, using RPN, performed by pressing &quot;8&quot;, &quot;Enter↑&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;+&quot;; instead of the algebraic [[infix notation]]: &quot;8&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;=&quot;).

The first Soviet ''scientific'' pocket-sized calculator the &quot;B3-18&quot; was completed by the end of 1975.

In 1973, [[Texas Instruments]](TI) introduced the [[SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) an ''algebraic entry'' pocket calculator using [[scientific notation]] for $150. Shortly after the SR-11 featured an additional key for entering [[Pi|&quot;π&quot;]]. It was followed the next year by the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]] which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed [[TI-30]] line which is still produced.

In 1978 a new company, [[Calculated Industries]], came onto the scene, focusing on specific markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger &lt;ref&gt;http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;(1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master &lt;ref&gt;http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.

==== Programmable calculators ====
[[Image:HP 65.jpg|thumb|The [[HP-65]], the first programmable pocket calculator]]
{{Main|Programmable calculator}}

The first desktop ''programmable calculators'' were produced in the mid-1960s by [[Mathatronics]] and [[Casio]] (AL-1000). These machines were, however, very heavy and expensive. The first programmable pocket calculator was the [[HP-65]], in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the [[HP-25C]] introduced [[HP Continuous memory|''continuous memory'']], i.e. programs and data were retained in [[CMOS]] memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41]]C. It could be expanded with [[random access memory|RAM]] (memory) and [[read-only memory|ROM]] (software) modules, as well as peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).

The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator ISKRA 123, powered by the power grid, was released at the beginning of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, [[Elektronika]] &quot;[[B3-21]]&quot;, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the beginning of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the [[Elektronika B3-34]] wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited capabilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including [[adventure game]]s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The [[Elektronika MK-52]] calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal [[EEPROM]] memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for [[Soyuz TM-7]] flight) as a backup of the board computer.

This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to &quot;synthetic programming&quot; of the American [[HP-41]], which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to non-existent addresses and other techniques. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine &quot;[[Nauka i Zhizn|Наука и жизнь]]&quot; (&quot;Science and Life&quot;), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization techniques for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, known as &quot;eggogology&quot; (&quot;еггогология&quot;). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word &quot;EGGOG&quot; (&quot;ЕГГОГ&quot;) which, unsurprisingly, is translated to &quot;Error&quot;.

A similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the [[HP-41]], which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than [[B3-34]].

==== Technical improvements ====
[[Image:Solar-calculator.jpg|thumb|right|A calculator which runs on solar and battery power.]]
Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s [[liquid crystal displays]] (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom ''LE-120A &quot;HANDY&quot;'' calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an [[LED]] display, and announced the Busicom ''LC'' with LCD display. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by [[Rockwell International]] and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking ''LC-800'', Harden ''DT/12'', Ibico ''086'', Lloyds ''40'', Lloyds ''100'', Prismatic ''500'' (aka ''P500''), Rapid Data ''Rapidman 1208LC''. The LCDs were an early form with the numbers appearing as silver against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.

A more successful series of calculators using the reflective LCD display was launched in 1972 by [[Sharp Inc]] with the Sharp ''EL-805'', which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's &quot;COS&quot; (Crystal on Substrate) technology. This used a glass-like circuit board which was also an integral part of the LCD. In operation the user looked through this &quot;circuit board&quot; at the numbers being displayed. The &quot;COS&quot; technology may have been too expensive since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards, though all the models with the reflective LCD displays are often referred to as &quot;COS&quot;.

In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with the now &quot;normal&quot; LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging [[ultraviolet]] rays. The advantage of the LCD is that it is passive and reflects light, which requires much less power than generating light. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the [[Casio]] ''Mini Card LC-78'' of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.

There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first &quot;Calculator on a chip&quot; [[integrated circuits]] in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more [[integrated circuits]] (ICs), especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.

The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of [[CMOS]] technology. Appearing in the Sharp &quot;EL-801&quot; in 1972, the [[transistors]] in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The [[LED]] and [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays often required additional driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCD displays were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.

With this low power consumption came the possibility of using [[solar cells]] as the power source, realised around 1978 by such calculators as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.

==== A pocket calculator for everyone ====
At the beginning of the 1970s hand-held electronic calculators were very expensive, costing two or three weeks' wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were expensive to produce, and production runs were not very large. Many companies saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on these high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production techniques improved, and the effect of economies of scale were felt.

By 1976 the cost of the cheapest 4-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about one 20th of the cost five years earlier. The consequences of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit out of calculators, leading to many companies dropping out of the business or closing down altogether. The companies that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.

===Mid-1980s to present===
The first calculator capable of symbolic computation was the [[HP-28]]C, released in 1987. It was able to, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first [[graphing calculator]] was the [[Casio]] [[Casio fx-7000G|FX-7000G]] released in 1985.

The two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a [[handheld computer]] was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-92 series|Voyage 200]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integral|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, solve [[differential equation]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.

The [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the &quot;HP 12c platinum edition&quot; which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.

[[Calculated Industries]] competed with the [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the “I”, “PV”, “FV” to easier labeling terms such as &quot;Int&quot;, &quot;Term&quot;, &quot;Pmt&quot;, and not using the [[reverse Polish notation]]. However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 90's to present. According to Mark Bollman,&lt;ref&gt;http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the &quot;Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators&quot; which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.

Personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functionality of a calculator, using the [[graphical user interface]] to portray a calculator. One such example is [[Calculator (Windows)|Windows Calculator]]. Most [[personal data assistant]]s (PDA) and [[smartphone]]s also have such a feature.

[[Image:Cmnational1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Antique crank-operated cash register]]

A '''cash register''' ([[US English]]) or '''till''' ([[British English]]) is a mechanical or electronic device for calculating and recording sales transactions, and an attached [[cash drawer]] for storing [[cash]]. The cash register also usually prints a [[receipt]] for the customer. 

In most cases the drawer can be opened only after a sale, except when using special [[key (lock)|keys]], which only senior employees and the owner have. This reduces the risk of employees [[stealing]] from the shop owner by not recording a sale and pocketing the money, when a customer does not need a receipt but has to be given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than [[inventory]]). In fact, cash registers were first invented for the purpose of eliminating employee theft or [[embezzlement]], and their original name was the ''Incorruptible Cashier''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryson&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[odd pricing]] came about because by charging odd amounts like 49 or 99 cents, the cashier very probably had to open the till for the penny change and thus announce the sale.

In the form of chest, used to segregate small items.

==History==
[[File:NationalCashRegister.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[National Cash Register]]]]

The first cash register was invented by [[James Ritty]] following the [[American Civil War]]. He was the owner of a saloon in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], [[United States|USA]], and wanted to stop employees from pilfering his profits. He invented the Ritty Model I in 1879 after seeing a tool that counted the revolutions of the propeller on a steamship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=98 |title=Replica of the Ritty Model 1 Cash Register |publisher=[[National Museum of American History]] |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of John Ritty, his brother, he patented it in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/ritty.html |title=Inventor of the Week: Archive |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |date=April 2002 |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first registers were entirely mechanical, without receipts. The employee was required to ring up every transaction on the register, and when the total key was pushed, the drawer opened and a bell would ring, alerting the manager to a sale taking place. Those original machines were nothing but simple adding machines.
[[File:Cash register, built 1904 in Ohio.jpg|thumb|left|[[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]] expressly built for a merchant in [[Nové Město nad Metují]], Austro-Hungary, 1904]]
Shortly after his patent, Ritty became overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the cash register business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]] Company and improved the cash register by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the [[receipt]]. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner could read the receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not pilfer the cash drawer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tale of the Tape: Retailers Take Receipts to Great Lengths|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|last1=Brat|first1=Ilan|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Ann|date=2 September  2009|page=A1|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125175363135673825.html|accessdate=2009-09-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, while working at the National Cash Register company, inventor [[Charles F. Kettering]] designed a cash register with an electric motor.

[[File:Moderncashregisters.jpg|thumb|Various types of modern cash registers.]]
A leading designer, builder, manufacturer, seller and exporter of cash registers in the 1950s until the 1970s was [[London]]-based (and later [[Brighton]]-based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__5836.aspx |title=Forum relating to the manufacturing activities at the Hollingbury industrial estate, Brighton, during the 1960s. |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}},&lt;/ref&gt;) Gross Cash Registers Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/gross.html |title=Gross Cash Registers pictures and company history  |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by brothers Sam and Henry Gross. Their cash registers were particularly popular around the time of [[decimalisation]] in Britain in early 1971, Henry having designed one of the few known models of cash register which could switch currencies from [[£sd]] to £p so that retailers could easily change from one to the other on or after [[decimal day|Decimal Day]]. Sweda also had decimal ready registers where the retailer used a special key on decimal day for the conversion.

==In current use==

Cash registers include a key labeled &quot;NS&quot;, which is abbreviated for &quot;No Sale&quot;, and opens the drawer, printing a receipt stating &quot;No Sale&quot; and recording it in the register log that the register was opened. Some other cash registers require a numeric password or physical key to be used when attempting to open the till. In some jurisdictions the law also requires customers to collect the receipt and keep it at least for a short while after leaving the shop,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slowtrav.com/italy/restaurants/receipt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roderickconwaymorris.com/Articles/registers are being replaced with general purpose [[computer]]s with [[Point of sale|POS]] software.

Today, these machines scan the barcode (usually [[European Article Number|EAN]] or [[Universal Product Code]] (UPC)) for each item, retrieve the price from a [[database]], calculate deductions for items on sale (or, in British retail terminology, &quot;special offer&quot;, &quot;multibuy&quot; or &quot;[[BOGOF]]&quot;), calculate the [[sales tax]] or [[VAT]], calculate differential rates for preferred customers, actualize inventory, time and date stamp the transaction, record the transaction in detail including each item purchased, record the method of payment, keep totals for each product or type of product sold as well as total sales for specified periods, and do other tasks as well. These POS terminals will often also identify the cashier on the receipt, and carry additional information or offers.

Currently, many cash registers are individual computers. They may be DOS, Windows or Unix based. Many of them have touch screens. They may be connected to computerized [[Point of sale]] networks using any type of protocol. Such systems may be accessed remotely for the purpose of obtaining records or troubleshooting.

Cash register manufacturers include [http://www.chd.sg CHD], [http://www.elcom.eu ELCOM], [http://www.sam4s.com SAM4S], Casio, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]], [[Wincor-Nixdorf]], [[Uniwell]], [[United Bank Card]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], TOWA MECCS, Datasym, [[Omron]], JCM, [http://www.royalsupplies.com Royal], Crisalid, Toshiba TEC Corporation, [http://www.unisystem.ua Unisystem], VeriFone, and DIGI(TERAOKA).

==Self checkout==
{{Main|Self checkout}}
Some corporations and [[supermarket]]s have introduced self-checkout machines, where the customer is trusted to scan the [[barcode]]s (or manually identify uncoded items like fruit), and place the items into a [[bagging]] area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-03.ibm.com/products/retail/products/self/sco/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The bag is weighed, and the machine halts the checkout when the weight of something in the bag doesn't match the weight in the inventory database. Normally, an employee is watching over several such checkouts to prevent theft or exploitation of the machines' weaknesses (for example,, intentional misidentification of expensive produce or dry goods). Payment on these machines is accepted by [[debit card]]/[[credit card]], or cash via coinslot and [[Bill validator|bank note scanner]]. Store employees are also needed to authorise &quot;age-restricted&quot; purchases, such as alcohol, solvents or knives, which can either be done remotely by the employee observing the self-checkout, or by means of a &quot;store login&quot; which the operator has to enter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CPU design''' is the [[design engineer]]ing task of creating a [[central processing unit]] (CPU), a component of [[computer hardware]]. It is a subfield of [[electronics engineering]] and [[computer engineering]].

== Overview ==

CPU design focuses on these areas:
# [[datapath]]s (such as [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s and [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]])
# [[control unit]]: logic which controls the datapaths
# Memory components such as register files, caches
# Clock circuitry such as clock drivers, [[Phase-locked loop|PLLs]], clock distribution networks
# Pad transceiver circuitry
# Logic gate cell [[Library (electronics)|library]] which is used to implement the logic

CPUs designed for high-performance markets might require custom designs for each of these items to achieve frequency, [[power consumption|power-dissipation]], and chip-area goals.

CPUs designed for lower performance markets might lessen the implementation burden by:
* Acquiring some of these items by purchasing them as  [[intellectual property]]
* Use control logic implementation techniques ([[logic synthesis]] using CAD tools) to implement the other components - datapaths, register files, clocks

Common logic styles used in CPU design include:
* Unstructured random logic
* [[Finite-state machine]]s
* [[Microprogramming]] (common from 1965 to 1985)
* [[Programmable logic array]] (common in the 1980s, no longer common)

Device types used to implement the logic include:
* [[Transistor-transistor logic]] [[Small Scale Integration]] logic chips - no longer used for CPUs
* [[Programmable Array Logic]] and [[Programmable logic device]]s - no longer used for CPUs
* [[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) [[gate array]]s - no longer common
* [[CMOS]] [[gate array]]s - no longer used for CPUs
* [[CMOS]] [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s - what's commonly used today, they're so common that the term ASIC is not used for CPUs
* [[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) - common for [[soft microprocessor]]s, and more or less required for [[reconfigurable computing]]

A CPU design project generally has these major tasks:
* Programmer-visible [[instruction set architecture]], which can be implemented by a variety of [[microarchitecture]]s
* Architectural study and performance modeling in [[ANSI C]]/[[C++]] or [[SystemC]]
* [[High-level synthesis]] (HLS) or [[register transfer level|RTL]] (e.g. logic) implementation
* RTL Verification
* [[Circuit design]] of speed critical components (caches, registers, ALUs)
* [[Logic synthesis]] or logic-gate-level design
* [[Static timing analysis|Timing analysis]] to confirm that all logic and circuits will run at the specified operating frequency
* Physical design including [[floorplanning]], [[place and route]] of logic gates
* Checking that RTL, gate-level, transistor-level and physical-level representations are equivalent
* Checks for [[signal integrity]], [[design rule checking|chip manufacturability]]

As with most complex electronic designs, the [[functional verification|logic verification]] effort (proving that the design does
not have bugs) now dominates the project schedule of a CPU.

Key CPU architectural innovations include [[index register]], [[CPU cache|cache]], [[virtual memory]], [[instruction pipelining]], [[superscalar]], [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]], [[virtual machine]], [[emulator]]s, [[microprogram]], and [[Stack (data structure)|stack]].

==Goals==

The first CPUs were designed to do mathematical calculations faster and more reliably than [[human computers]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Randell: The Origins of Digital Computers. Berlin: Springer 1973. ISBN 0-387-06169&lt;/ref&gt;

Each successive generation of CPU might be designed to achieve some of these goals:
* higher performance levels of a single program or thread
* higher throughput levels of multiple programs/threads
* [[low-power|less power consumption]] for the same performance level
* lower cost for the same performance level
* greater connectivity to build larger, more parallel systems
* more specialization to aid in specific targeted markets

Re-designing a CPU core to a smaller die-area helps achieve several of these goals.
* Shrinking everything (a &quot;[[photomask]] shrink&quot;), resulting in the same number of transistors on a smaller die, improves performance (smaller transistors switch faster), reduces power (smaller wires have less [[parasitic capacitance]]) and reduces cost (more CPUs fit on the same wafer of silicon).
* Releasing a CPU on the same size die, but with a smaller CPU core, keeps the cost about the same but allows higher levels of integration within one [[VLSI]] chip (additional cache, multiple CPUs, or other components), improving performance and reducing overall system cost.

==Performance analysis and benchmarking==

{{Main| Computer performance}}

Because there are too many programs to test a CPU's speed on all of them, [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s were developed.
The most famous benchmarks are the SPECint and SPECfp benchmarks developed by [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]] and the [[ConsumerMark]] benchmark developed by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium [[EEMBC]].

Some important measurements include:
* [[Instructions per second]] - Most consumers pick a computer architecture (normally [[Intel]] [[IA32]] architecture) to be able to run a large base of pre-existing pre-compiled software.  Being relatively uninformed on computer benchmarks,  some of them pick a particular CPU based on operating frequency (see [[Megahertz Myth]]).
* [[FLOPS]] - The number of floating point operations per second is often important in selecting computers for scientific computations.
* [[Performance per watt]] - System designers building [[parallel computing|parallel computers]], such as [[Google search technology#Current hardware|Google]], pick CPUs based on their speed per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself. [http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/consumer.asp?HTYPE=SIM][http://news.com.com/Power+could+cost+more+than+servers,+Google+warns/2100-1010_3-5988090.html]
* Some system designers building parallel computers pick CPUs based on the speed per dollar.
* System designers building [[real-time computing]] systems want to guarantee worst-case response. That is easier to do when the CPU has low [[interrupt latency]] and when it has deterministic response. ([[Digital signal processor|DSP]])
* Computer programmers who program directly in assembly language want a CPU to support a full featured [[instruction set]].
* Low power - For systems with limited power sources (e.g. solar, batteries, human power).
* Small size or low weight - for portable embedded systems, systems for spacecraft.
* Environmental impact - Minimizing environmental impact of computers during manufacturing and recycling as well during use.  Reducing waste, reducing hazardous materials.  (see [[Green computing]]).  &lt;!-- ... Are there other measures of &quot;goodness&quot;, &quot;figures of merit&quot;, that I'm missing here? --&gt;

Some of these measures conflict.  In particular, many design techniques that make a CPU run faster make the &quot;performance per watt&quot;, &quot;performance per dollar&quot;, and &quot;deterministic response&quot; much worse, and vice versa.

==Markets==

There are several different markets in which CPUs are used. Since each of these markets differ in their requirements for CPUs, the devices designed for one market are in most cases inappropriate for the other markets.

===General purpose computing===

The vast majority of revenues generated from CPU sales is for general purpose computing{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. That is, desktop, laptop and server computers commonly used in businesses and homes. In this market, the Intel [[IA-32]] architecture dominates, with its rivals [[PowerPC]] and [[SPARC]] maintaining much smaller customer bases. Yearly, hundreds of millions of IA-32 architecture CPUs are used by this market.

Since these devices are used to run countless different types of programs, these CPU designs are not specifically targeted at one type of application or one function. The demands of being able to run a wide range of programs efficiently has made these CPU designs among the more advanced technically, along with some disadvantages of being relatively costly, and having high power consumption.

====High-end processor economics====
In 1984, most high-performance CPUs required four to five years to develop.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;New system manages hundreds of transactions per second&quot; article
by Robert Horst and Sandra Metz, of Tandem Computers Inc.,
&quot;Electronics&quot; magazine, 1984 April 19:
&quot;While most high-performance CPUs require four to five years to develop,
The [[NonStop]] TXP processor took just 2+1/2 years --
six months to develop a complete written specification,
one year to construct a working prototype,
and another year to reach volume production.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2009}}
Developing new, high-end CPUs is a very costly proposition. Both the logical complexity (needing very large logic design and logic verification teams and simulation farms with perhaps thousands of computers) and the high operating frequencies (needing large circuit design teams and access to the state-of-the-art fabrication process) account for the high cost of design for this type of chip. The design cost of a high-end CPU will be on the order of US $100 million. Since the design of such high-end chips nominally takes about five years to complete, to stay competitive a company has to fund at least two of these large design teams to release products at the rate of 2.5 years per product generation.

As an example, the typical loaded cost for one computer engineer is often quoted to be $250,000 US dollars/year. This includes salary, benefits, CAD tools, computers, office space rent, etc. Assuming that 100 engineers are needed to design a CPU and the
project takes 4 years.

Total cost = $250,000 / Engineer-Man/Year x 100 engineers x 4 years = $100,000,000 USD.

The above amount is just an example. The design teams for modern day general purpose CPUs have several hundred team members.

===Scientific computing===
{{Main|Supercomputer}}

A much smaller niche market (in revenue and units shipped) is scientific computing, used in government research labs and universities. Previously much CPU design was done for this market, but the cost-effectiveness of using mass market CPUs has curtailed almost all specialized designs for this market. The main remaining area of active hardware design and research for scientific computing is for high-speed system interconnects.

=== Embedded design ===

As measured by units shipped, most CPUs are embedded in other machinery, such as telephones, clocks, appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure. Embedded processors sell in the volume of many billions of units per year, however, mostly at much lower price points than that of the general purpose processors.

These single-function devices differ from the more familiar general-purpose CPUs in several ways:
* Low cost is of utmost importance.
* It is important to maintain a low power dissipation as embedded devices often have a limited battery life and it is often impractical to include cooling fans.
* To give lower system cost, peripherals are integrated with the processor on the same silicon chip.
* Keeping peripherals on-chip also reduces power consumption as external GPIO ports typically require buffering so that they can source or sink the relatively high current loads that are required to maintain a strong signal outside of the chip.
** Many embedded applications have a limited amount of physical space for circuitry; keeping peripherals on-chip will reduce the space required for the circuit board.
** The program and data memories are often integrated on the same chip. When the only allowed program memory is [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the device is known as a [[microcontroller]].
* For many embedded applications, interrupt latency will be more critical than in some general-purpose processors.

====Embedded processor economics====

As of 2009, more CPUs are produced using the [[ARM architecture]] instruction set than any other 32-bit instruction set. The ARM architecture and the first ARM chip were designed in about one and a half years and 5 man years of work time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atterer.net/acorn/arm.html &quot;ARM's way&quot;] 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The 32-bit [[Parallax Propeller]] microcontroller architecture and the first chip were designed by two people in about 10 man years of work time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallax.com/Portals/0/Downloads/docs/article/WhythePropellerWorks.pdf &quot;Why the Propeller Works&quot;] by [[Chip Gracey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed{{Weasel-inline|date=March 2009}} that the 8-bit [[Atmel AVR|AVR architecture]] and first AVR microcontroller was conceived and designed by two students at the Norwegian Institute of Technology.

The 8-bit 6502 architecture and the first [[MOS Technology 6502]] chip were designed in 13 months by a group of about 9 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://silicongenesis.stanford.edu/transcripts/mensch.htm &quot;Interview with William Mensch&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research and educational CPU design ====

The 32 bit [[Berkeley RISC]] I and RISC II architecture and the first chips were mostly designed by a series of students as part of a four quarter sequence of graduate courses.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1982/CSD-82-106.pdf 'Design and Implementation of RISC I'] - original journal article by [[Carlo Sequin|C.E. Sequin]] and [[David A. Patterson (scientist)|D.A.Patterson]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
This design became the basis of the commercial [[SPARC]] processor design.

For about a decade, every student taking the 6.004 class at MIT was part of a team—each team had one semester to design and build a simple 8 bit CPU out of [[7400 series]] [[integrated circuit]]s.
One team of 4 students designed and built a simple 32 bit CPU during that semester.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sub-zero.mit.edu/fbyte/hacks/vhs/ &quot;the VHS&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some undergraduate courses require a team of 2 to 5 students to design, implement, and test a simple CPU in a FPGA in a single 15 week semester.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fpgacpu.org/teaching.html &quot;Teaching Computer Design with FPGAs&quot;] by Jan Gray
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Soft microprocessor cores ====

For embedded systems, the highest performance levels are often not needed or desired due to the power consumption requirements. This allows for the use of processors which can be totally implemented by [[logic synthesis]] techniques. These synthesized processors can be implemented in a much shorter amount of time, giving quicker time-to-market.

''This article is about bird taxonomy; for the topic in pottery and glassware design, see [[Carinate]].''

The '''Carinatae''' are, in [[phylogenetic taxonomy]], the last common ancestor of the Neornithes ([[modern birds]]) and [[Ichthyornis]] (an extinct seabird of the [[Cretaceous]]), and all its descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cracraft |first=Joel |authorlink= |year=1986 |month= |title=The origin and early diversification of birds |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=pp. 383–399 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defined in this way, the group includes all modern [[bird]]s, both living and recently extinct, and a few [[Mesozoic]] forms. 

==Earlier definition==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
Traditionally, Carinatae were defined as all birds whose [[sternum]] (breast bone) has a [[keel (bird)|keel]] (''carina''). The keel is a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum. This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel. [[Ratite]]s, all of whom are flightless, lack a strong keel. Thus, living birds were divided into carinates (keeled) and ratites (from ''ratis'', &quot;raft&quot;, referring to the flatness of the sternum). 

The difficulty with this scheme [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] was that some flightless birds, without strong carinae, are descended directly from ordinary flying birds with carinae. Examples include the [[Kakapo]], a flightless [[parrot]], and the [[dodo]], a columbiform (the [[pigeon]] family). None of these birds are ratites. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenic relationship. 

==Current definition==
The use of a term for keeled sternum to describe the Ichthyornis–Neornithine group turned out to be equally inapt. Various dinosaurs – apparently, remote ancestors and cousins of the Carinatae – ''do'' possess a keeled sternum. So, evidently the presence of this structure does not necessarily imply its use in [[flight]]. This sort of definitional problem is one reason why the use of physical characteristics to name taxonomic groups is now discouraged. 

The characteristics that actually are unique to the Carinatae have little to do with the sternum. Rather, carinates are unique in having, for example, a globe-shaped, convex head on the [[humerus]] and fully fused bones in the lower leg and outer arm.

They also have a pterygoid bone that articulates with the palatine by means of a joint. The vomer is reduced or absent.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Ogilvie-Grant (1921) Guide to the gallery of birds. Part 1. British Museum. (2nd Edn)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origin of the word ''cocktail'' is not known.

The earliest known printed use of ''cocktail'' is said to be in ''The Farmer's Cabinet'' on April 28, 1803:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|Drank a glass of cocktail—excellent for the head...Call'd at the Doct's. found Burnham—he looked very wise—drank another glass of cocktail.}}

However, according to the bibliographer Stephen Conrad Stuntz,&lt;ref&gt;Stuntz (1941), ''List of the agricultural periodicals of the United States and Canada'': ''The Farmer's Cabinet'' was begun as a semi-monthly at Philadephia (July 1836 to 15 February 1837), at Philadelphia and Pittsburgh (1 March to ?15 November 1837), at Philadelphia (December 1837 to 15 May 1838), monthly at Philadelphia and Wilmington (15 June 1838 to July 1840); it was continued as ''The Farmer's cabinet and  American herd-book''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Farmer's Cabinet'', a semi-monthly magazine published at Philadelphia, was not begun until July 1836; the date would be a misprint, perhaps for a date in the 1830s.

The earliest definition of ''cocktail'' was in the May 13, 1806, edition of  ''The Balance and Columbian Repository'', a publication in [[Hudson, New York]], in which an answer was provided to the question, &quot;What is a cocktail?&quot;. It replied:

{{quote|Cocktail is a stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters—it is vulgarly called a bittered sling and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, inasmuch as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use to a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic]] candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow anything else.}}

The first publication of a [[bartender]]s' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 — ''How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion'', by &quot;Professor&quot; [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]. In addition to listings of recipes for Punches, Sours, Slings, Cobblers, Shrubs, Toddies, Flips, and a variety of other types of mixed drinks were 10 recipes for drinks referred to as &quot;Cocktails&quot;. A key ingredient which differentiated &quot;cocktails&quot; from other drinks in this compendium was the use of [[bitters]] as an ingredient, although it is not used in many modern cocktail recipes.

The first &quot;cocktail party&quot; ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], in May 1917.  Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm.  The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]] bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119161653517750477.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=St. Louis -- Party Central | first=Eric | last=Felten | date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1920–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]. The quality of liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously.&lt;ref name=Regan /&gt; There was a shift from [[whiskey]] to [[gin]], which does not require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating Cinco de Drinko|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=November 28, 2008|author=Eric Felton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and in the 1970s, as other [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] became common. In the 1980s, cocktails again became popular, with [[vodka]] often substituted for gin in drinks such as the [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]. Traditional cocktails and gin began to make a comeback in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The word ''cocktail'' is sometimes used figuratively for a mixture of liquids or other substances.  Such a use might be, for example: &quot;120 years of industry have dosed the area's soil with a noxious cocktail of heavy metals and chemical contaminants.&quot;

A makeshift incendiary bomb consisting of a bottle of flammable liquid (usually gasoline) with a flaming rag attached is known as a &quot;[[Molotov cocktail]]&quot;.

The '''Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{coptic|Ϯⲉⲕ̀ⲕⲗⲏⲥⲓⲁ ̀ⲛⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ ̀ⲛⲟⲣⲑⲟⲇⲟⲝⲟⲥ}} ''ti.eklyseya en.remenkimi en.orthodoxos'', literally: ''the Egyptian Orthodox Church''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the official name for the largest [[Christianity|Christian]] church in [[Egypt]]. The Church belongs to the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] family of churches, which has been a distinct church body since the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, when it took a different position over [[Christology|Christological]] theology from that of the body of churches that would later split into [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. The precise differences in theology that caused the split with the Coptic Christians are still disputed, highly technical and mainly concerned with the nature of [[Christ]]. The foundational roots of the Church are based in Egypt but it has a worldwide following.
According to tradition the Coptic Orthodox Church is the Church of [[Alexandria]] which was established by [[St. Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] the apostle and evangelist in the middle of the 1st century (approximately AD 42).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that Saint Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 A.D. &quot;Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity&quot; Otto F. A. Meinardus p28.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the church and the [[Episcopal See|See]] of Alexandria is the [[Coptic Pope|Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy See of Saint Mark]], currently [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]]. Around 95% of Egypt's was Christianity in Egypt|now many Christians converted to islam 
and at the  moment  5-10% christians belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xrGL7o69KBIC&amp;pg=PA145|title=Who are the Christians in the Middle East?|date=June 18, 2009|publisher=Betty Jane Bailey|isbn=9780802810205|author1=Bailey, Betty Jane|author2=Martin Bailey, J}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other churches also claim [[Patriarchate]]s and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchs of Alexandria]]; among them:

* The [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]
* The [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic Church of Alexandria]]
* The [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem]]

==History==
{{Copts}}

===Apostolic foundation===
Egypt is identified in the [[Bible]] as the place of refuge that the [[Holy Family]] sought in its flight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/The_Holy_Family_in_Egypt |title=Holy Family in Egypt |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Judea]]: &quot;When he [Joseph] arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of [[Herod the Great]], that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, ''Out of Egypt I called My Son''&quot; ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 2:12–23).

The Egyptian Church, which is now more than 1,900 years old, regards itself as the subject of many prophecies in the [[Old Testament]]. [[Isaiah]] the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says &quot;In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.&quot;

The first Christians in Egypt were common people who spoke Egyptian [[Coptic language|Coptic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ECM&quot;&gt;[http://home.att.net/~nathan.wilson/missionbios.html Early church missionary]&lt;/ref&gt; there were also Alexandrian [[Jew]]s such as [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], whom [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke the Evangelist]] addresses in the introductory chapter of his [[Gospel of Luke|gospel]]. When the church was founded by [[Saint Mark]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Coptic_church |title=Coptic church |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] [[Nero]], a great multitude of native Egyptians (as opposed to [[Greeks]] or Jews) embraced the Christian faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECM&quot;/&gt;

Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of Saint Mark's arrival in Alexandria, as is clear from the [[New Testament]] writings found in [[Oxyrhynchus|Bahnasa]], in Middle Egypt, which date around the year AD 200, and a fragment of the [[Gospel of John]], written in Coptic, which was found in [[Upper Egypt]] and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local language, namely Coptic.

===Contributions to Christianity===
====The Catechetical School of Alexandria====

The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] is the oldest catechetical school in the world. St. [[Jerome]] records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by Saint Mark himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/patrology/schoolofalex/I-Intro/chapter1.html |title=The School of Alexandria - Part I - An Introduction to the School of Alexandria |publisher=Copticchurch.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 190 AD under the leadership of the scholar [[Pantanaeus]], the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]], and the native Egyptian [[Origen]], who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. Origen wrote over 6,000 commentaries of the Bible in addition to his famous [[Hexapla]].

Many scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before [[Braille]], wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.

The Theological college of the catechetical school was re-established in 1893. The new school currently has campuses in Ireland, [[Cairo]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Los Angeles]], where Coptic priests-to-be and other qualified men and women are taught among other subjects Christian theology, history, the Coptic language and art - including chanting, music, [[iconography]], and tapestry.

====The cradle of monasticism and its missionary work====
{{Main|Coptic monasticism}}
Many Egyptian Christians went to the desert during the 3rd century, and remained there to pray and work and dedicate their lives to seclusion and worship of God. This was the beginning of the [[Monasticism|monastic movement]], which was organized by [[Saint Anthony the Great|Anthony the Great]], Saint Paul, the world's first [[anchorite]], [[Macarius the Great|Saint Macarius the Great]] and [[Pachomius|Saint Pachomius the Cenobite]] in the 4th century.

Christian [[monasticism]] was born in Egypt and was instrumental in the formation of the Coptic Orthodox Church character of submission, simplicity and humility, thanks to the teachings and writings of the [[Desert Fathers|Great Fathers of Egypt's Deserts]]. By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. A great number of these monasteries are still flourishing and have new vocations to this day.

All Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example: [[Saint Basil|Saint Basil the Great]] Archbishop of Ceasaria of Cappadocia, founder and organizer of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around AD 357 and his rule is followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches; Saint Jerome who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt, while en route to [[Jerusalem]], around AD 400 and left details of his experiences in his letters; [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, but in a stricter form. Countless pilgrims have visited the &quot;Desert Fathers&quot; to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives.

===Role and participation in the Ecumenical Councils===
====Council of Nicea====
In the 4th century, an Alexandrian [[presbyter]] named [[Arius]] began a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known as [[Arianism]]. The [[Ecumenical Council of Nicea]] AD 325 was convened by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] under the presidency of Saint [[Hosius of Cordova]] and Saint [[Alexander of Alexandria]] to resolve the dispute and eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Creed, which is now recited throughout the Christian world, was based largely on the teaching put forth by a man who eventually would become Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the chief opponent of Arius.

====Council of Constantinople====
In the year AD 381, Pope [[Timothy I of Alexandria]] presided over the second ecumenical council known as the Ecumenical [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]], to judge Macedonious, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. This council completed the [[Nicene Creed]] with this confirmation of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]]:

:&quot;I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in One, Holy, Universal, and Apostolic church. I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen.&quot;

====Council of Ephesus====
[[File:CopticAltar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Coptic Icon in the Coptic Altar of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]

Another theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings of [[Nestorius]], the Patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was not [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostatically]] joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title &quot;Mother of God&quot; ''([[Theotokos]])'' to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], declaring her instead to be &quot;Mother of Christ&quot; ''[[Christotokos]]''.

When reports of this reached the Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark, Pope Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]] acted quickly to correct this breach with orthodoxy, requesting that Nestorius repent. When he would not, the Synod of Alexandria met in an emergency session and a unanimous agreement was reached. Pope [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]], supported by the entire See, sent a letter to Nestorius known as &quot;The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius.&quot; This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: &quot;The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril.&quot; In these [[anathema]]s, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, &quot;Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' is Anathema!&quot; Nestorius however, still would not repent and so this led to the convening of the [[First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus]] (431), over which Cyril presided.

The Council confirmed the teachings of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]] and confirmed the title of Mary as &quot;[[Mother of God]]&quot;. It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Athanasius had said that there is &quot;One Nature and One Hypostasis for God the Word Incarnate&quot; (''Mia Physis tou Theou Loghou Sesarkomeni''). Also, the introduction to the creed was formulated as follows:

:&quot;We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God ''(Theotokos)'' for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen.&quot; [not dissimilar to the &quot;Axion Estin&quot; Chant still used in Orthodoxy]

====Council of Chalcedon====
[[File:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|thumb|left|St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria]]

When in AD 451, Emperor [[Marcianus]] attempted to heal divisions in the Church, the response of [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus]] – the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled – was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the Church. It was at [[Chalcedon]] that the emperor, through the Imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness.

The [[Council of Chalcedon]], from the perspective of the Alexandrine Christology, has deviated from the approved Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However, in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, &quot;Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary,&quot; thus the foundation of the definition according to the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] adherents, according to the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria is valid. There is a change in the Non-Chalcedonian definition here, as the Nicene creed clearly uses the terms &quot;of&quot;, rather than &quot;in&quot;.

In terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonians) understanding is that Christ is &quot;One Nature--the Logos Incarnate,&quot; ''of'' the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians' understanding is that Christ is ''in'' two natures, full humanity and full divinity. Just as humans are of their mothers and fathers and not in their mothers and fathers, so too is the nature of Christ according to [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. If Christ is in full humanity and in full divinity, then He is separate in two persons as the Nestorians teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mfignatius/others/byzantine01.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:32:52 |title=Split of the Byzantine and Oriental Churches |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the doctrinal perception that makes the apparent difference which separated the Oriental Orthodox from the Eastern Orthodox.

The Council's findings were rejected by many of the Christians on the fringes of the [[Byzantine Empire]], including Egyptians, [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrians]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]], and others.

From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as the [[List of Coptic Popes|Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of St. Mark]] and the &quot;[[Melkite]]&quot; or Imperial Patriarch, now known as the Greek Orthodox Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekorthodox-alexandria.org/ Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria].&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria). Those who supported the Chalcedonian definition remained in [[Full communion|communion]] with the other leading churches of [[History of the Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]]. The non-Chalcedonian party became what is today called the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]].

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria regards itself as having been misunderstood at the Council of Chalcedon. There was an opinion in the Church that viewed that perhaps the Council understood the Church of Alexandria correctly, but wanted to curtail the existing power of the Alexandrine Hierarch, especially after the events that happened several years before at Constantinople from Pope [[Theophilus of Alexandria]] towards Patriarch [[John Chrysostom]] and the unfortunate turnouts of the Second Council of Ephesus in AD 449, where Eutichus misled Pope Dioscorus and the Council in confessing the Orthodox Faith in writing and then renouncing it after the Council, which in turn, had upset Rome, especially that the Tome which was sent was not read during the Council sessions.

To make things even worse, the Tome of Pope Leo of Rome was, according to the Alexandria School of Theology, particularly in regards to the definition of Christology, considered influenced by Nestorian heretical teachings. So, due to the above mentioned, especially in the consecutive sequences of events, the Hierarchs of Alexandria were considered holding too much of power from one hand, and on the other hand, due to the conflict of the Schools of Theology, there would be an impass and a scapegoat, i.e. Pope Dioscorus. The Tome of Leo has been widely criticized (surprisingly by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox scholars) in the past 50 years as a much less than perfect orthodox theological doctrine.

It is also to be noted that by anathemizing Pope Leo, because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so, without due process, in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] in AD 449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the council's canons.

Copts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.&lt;ref&gt;Romanides, John S. [http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm Leo of Rome's Support of Theodoret].&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians &quot;[[Monophysitism|monophysites]]&quot;, though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as &quot;[[Dyophysitism|dyophysite]]&quot;.

A term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]], which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria believes that Christ is perfect in His divinity, and He is perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called &quot;the nature of the incarnate word&quot;, which was reiterated by [[Cyril of Alexandria|Saint Cyril of Alexandria]].

Copts, thus, believe in two natures &quot;human&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; that are united in one hypostasis &quot;without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration&quot;. These two natures &quot;did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye&quot; (Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil of Caesarea).

===From Chalcedon to the Arab conquest of Egypt===
{{Eastern Christianity}}
Copts suffered under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The [[Melkite]] Patriarchs, appointed by the emperors as both spiritual leaders and civil governors, massacred the Egyptian population whom they considered heretics. Many [[Egyptians]] were tortured and martyred to accept the terms of Chalcedon, but Egyptians remained loyal to the faith of their fathers and to the Cyrillian view of Christology. One of the most renowned Egyptian saints of that period is [[Saint Samuel the Confessor]].

===Muslim conquest of Egypt===
The [[Muslim invasion of Egypt]] took place in AD 639. Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian population remained mainly Christian. However, the gradual conversions to [[Islam]] over the centuries changed Egypt from a Christian to a largely Muslim country by the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, Jill (1997). ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Islamic rule, the Copts paid a high tax, the ''[[jizya]]''. Also, Copts were later, and still are, persecuted by fanatics within the country.

===From the 19th century to the 1952 revolution===
The position of the Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]]. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit. In 1855 the ''jizya'' tax was abolished. Shortly thereafter, the Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army.&lt;ref name=&quot;StGeorge&quot;&gt;http://suscopts.org/stgeorgedaytona/coptic_church.html &quot;Saint Mark&quot; St George Coptic Orthodox Church of Daytona&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Coptic Church underwent phases of new development. In 1853, Pope Cyril IV established the first modern Coptic schools, including the first Egyptian school for girls. He also founded a printing press, which was the second national press in the country. Pope Cyril IV established very friendly relations with other denominations, to the extent that when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself for a long period of time outside the country, he left his Church under the guidance of the Coptic Patriarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;StGeorge&quot;/&gt;

The Theological College of the School of Alexandria was reestablished in 1893. It began its new history with five students, one of whom was later to become its dean. Today it has campuses in Alexandria, Cairo, and various dioceses throughout Egypt, as well as outside Egypt, in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne and London, where potential clergymen and other qualified men and women are taught many subjects, among which are theology, church history, missionary studies, and Coptic language.&lt;ref name=&quot;StGeorge&quot;/&gt;

Although under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church, these adherents are not considered Copts, since they are not ethnic Egyptians. Some accounts regard members of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (roughly 45 million),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.wcc-coe.org/pressreleasesen.nsf/index/pr-05-55.html WCC official visit to Ethiopia] World Council of Churches - News Release. 21 September 2005. Retrieved 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (roughly 2.5 million), as members of the Coptic Orthodox Church. This is however a misnomer, since both the Ethiopian and the Eritrean Churches, although daughter churches of the Church of Alexandria, are currently autocephalous churches. In 1959, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted its first own Patriarch by [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]]. Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church similarly became independent of the Ethiopian Tewahedo Church in 1994, when four bishops were consecrated by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] to form the basis of a local Holy Synod of the Eritrean Church. In 1998, the Eritrean Church gained its autocephelacy from the Coptic Orthodox Church when its first Patriarch was enthroned by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]].

These three churches remain in [[full communion]] with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church do acknowledge the Honorary Supremacy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]], since the [[Church of Alexandria]] is technically their Mother Church. Upon their selection, both Patriarchs (Ethiopian &amp; Eritrean) must receive the approval and communion from the Holy Synod of the [[Church of Alexandria|Apostolic See of Alexandria]] before their enthronement.

Since the 1980s theologians from the Oriental (Non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox and Eastern (Chalcedonian) Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing (see [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Agreed_Official_Statements_on_Christology_with_the_Catholic_and_Eastern_Orthodox_Churches Agreed Official Statements on Christology with the Eastern Orthodox Churches]).

In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Pastoral_Agreement_between_the_Coptic_Orthodox_and_Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchates_of_Alexandria_%282001%29 Official Statements on Christology].&lt;/ref&gt; to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other's churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other. Previously, if a Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox wanted to get married, the marriage had to be performed twice, once in each church, for it to be recognized by both. Now it can be done in only one church and be recognized by both.

According to Christian Tradition and Canon Law, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria only ordains men, and if they wish to be married, they must be married before they are ordained. In this respect they follow the same practices as does the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

Traditionally, the [[Coptic language]] was used in church services, and the scriptures were written in the [[Coptic alphabet]]. However, due to the Arabisation of Egypt, service in churches started to witness increased use of Arabic, while preaching is done entirely in Arabic. Native languages are used, in conjunction with Coptic, during services outside of Egypt.

Coptic Orthodox Christians celebrate [[Christmas]] on the 7th of January ([[Gregorian Calendar]]), which coincides with the 25th of December according to the [[Julian Calendar]]. The Coptic Orthodox Church uses the [[Julian Calendar]] as its Ecclesiastical Calendar. It is known as the [[Coptic calendar]] or the [[Coptic Calendar|Alexandrian Calendar]]. This calendar is in turn based on the old [[Egyptian calendar]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] is thus considered an Old Calendrist Church. [[Christmas]] according to the [[Coptic calendar]] was adopted as an official national holiday in [[Egypt]] since 2002.

==Jurisdiction outside of Egypt==
[[File:ChristCopticArt.jpg|frame|The Lord [[Jesus Christ]] in a [[Coptic art|Coptic icon]]]]

Besides Egypt, the [[Church of Alexandria]] has jurisdiction over [[Pentapolis]], [[Libya]], [[Nubia]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and all [[Africa]].

Both the Patriarchate of [[Addis Ababa]] and all Ethiopia, and the Patriarchate of [[Asmara]] and all [[Eritrea]] do acknowledge the supremacy of honor and dignity of the [[Pope of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria]] on the basis that both Patriarchates were established by the Throne of Alexandria and that they have their roots in the Apostolic Church of Alexandria, and acknowledge that Saint Mark the Apostle is the founder of their Churches through the heritage and Apostolic evangelization of the Fathers of Alexandria.

In other words, the Patriarchates of Ethiopia and Eritrea are daughter Churches of the Holy Apostolic [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]].

In addition to the above, the countries of [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]], [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]] are under the jurisdiction and the evangelization of the Throne of [[Alexandria]]. It is still expanding in the vast continent of [[Africa]].

==Daughter churches==
===Ethiopian Orthodox Church===
Since the Christianization of Ethiopia in the 4th century, the Church of Ethiopia has come under the dominion of the Church of Alexandria. The first bishop of Ethiopia, [[Frumentius|Saint Frumentius]], was consecrated as [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Bishop of Axum]] by [[Pope Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 328 AD. From then on, until 1959, the [[Pope of Alexandria]], as Patriarch of All Africa, always named an Egyptian (a Copt) to be the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Church. On 13 July 1948, the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] reached an agreement concerning the relationship between the two churches. In 1950, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] was granted autocephaly by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria]], head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Five Ethiopian bishops were immediately consecrated by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, and were empowered to elect a new Patriarch for their church. This promotion was completed when Joseph II consecrated the first Ethiopian-born Archbishop, [[Abuna Basilios]], as head of the Ethiopian Church on 14 January 1951. In 1959, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] crowned [[Abuna Baslios]] as the first [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Patriarch of Ethiopia]].

Patriarch Basilios died in 1971, and was succeeded on the same year by [[Abuna Theophilos]]. With the fall of Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] in 1974, the new Marxist government arrested Abuna Theophilos and secretly executed him in 1979. The Ethiopian government then ordered the Ethiopian Church to elect [[Abuna Takla Haymanot]] as Patriarch of Ethiopia. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Abuna Takla Haymanot on the grounds that the Synod of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Abuna Theophilos, and that the Ethiopian government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other.

After the death of Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1988, [[Abune Merkorios]] who had close ties to the [[Derg]] (Communist) government was elected Patriarch of Ethiopia. Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, Abune Merkorios abdicated under public and governmental pressure and went to exile in the [[United States]]. The newly elected Patriarch, [[Abune Paulos]] was officially recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1992 as the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] were resumed on July 13, 2007.

===Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church===
Following the independence of [[Eritrea]] from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. In 1994, Shenouda ordained [[Abune Phillipos]] as first Archbishop of Eritrea. The [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] obtained autocephaly on 7 May 1998, and Abune Phillipos was subsequently consecrated as first Patriarch of Eritrea. The two churches remain in full communion with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], although the Coptic Orthodox Church does not recognize the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, [[Abune Antonios]].

===Historical evolution of the ecclesiastical title===
[[File:PopeCyril14.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]], the 116th [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of All Africa]] on the Holy Apostolic See of [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] (1959 - 1971).]]
The Bishop of Alexandria was first known just as the ''Bishop of Alexandria''. It continued to be so, until the Church grew within and all over the Egyptian Province, and many Bishops were consecrated for the newly founded parishes all over the towns and cities.

The Bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first Bishop in [[Egypt]] consecrated by [[Saint Mark]], was honored by the other Bishops, as first among equals ''&quot;Primus inter Pares,&quot;''. This was in addition to the appropriate honorary dignity, which was due by virtue of being the Senior Bishop of the main [[Metropolis]] of the Province, [[Alexandria]], which also the Capital and the main Port of the Province. This honor was bestowed by making the Senior Bishop an ''“[[Archbishop]],”'' thus presiding in dignity of honor over all the Alexandrine and Egyptian Bishops.

The appellation of ''“Pope”'' has been attributed to the Bishop of Alexandria since the Episcopate of [[Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]], the 13th Bishop of [[Alexandria]]. All the clergy of [[Alexandria]] and [[Lower Egypt]] honored him with the appellation ''“Papas,”'' which means “Our Father,” as the Senior and Elder Bishop among all bishops, within the [[Egypt]]ian Province, who are under his jurisdiction. This is because [[Alexandria]] was the Capital of the Province, and the preaching center and the place of martyrdom of [[Saint Mark]] the Evangelist and Apostle.

The title ''“[[Patriarch]]”'' means the Head or the Leader of a Tribe or a Community. Ecclesiastically it means the Head of the Fathers (Bishops) and their congregation of faithful. This title is historically known as “[[Patriarch]] of [[Alexandria]] and all [[Africa]] on the Holy Apostolic Throne of [[Saint Mark]] the Evangelist,” that is “of [[Alexandria]] and of all [[Africa]].” The title of “Patriarch” was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], convened in AD 431, and ratified at [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in AD 451.

It is to be noted that only the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] has the double title of '''Pope''' and '''Patriarch''' among the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Thrones.

''The Sunday Times (Sydney)'' 1992-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt; started in 1968 in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It began in the late 1960s, with many of its early [[Religious conversion|converts]] drawn from the [[hippie|hippie movement]]. The Children of God was among the movements prompting the cult controversy of the 1970s and 1980s in the United States and Europe and triggered the first organized [[Anti-cult movement|anticult]] group [[FREECOG]].

==Overview==
As TFI grew and expanded around the world, so did its message of [[salvation]], [[apocalypticism]], and spiritual &quot;revolution&quot; against the outside world, which the members called &quot;the System,&quot; as well as resultant controversy. In 1974, it began a method of [[evangelism]] called [[Flirty Fishing]], sometimes using sex to show God's love and win converts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='The Family' and Final Harvest |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/children_of_god/child1.htm |quote=Sure, Alexander concedes, plenty of people object that The Family's &quot;Law of Love&quot; permits sex outside marriage and that the group once condoned a practice known as &quot;flirty fishing&quot; – the use of sex to win converts. |publisher=Washington Post |date=June 2, 1993 |accessdate=2008-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was discontinued in 1987. TFI's founder and prophetic leader, [[David Berg]], who was first called &quot;Moses David&quot; in the Texas press, communicated with his followers via ''Mo Letters''—letters of instruction and counsel on myriad spiritual and practical subjects—until his death in late 1994.&lt;ref name=moletters&gt;[http://pubs.xfamily.org xFamily.org Publications Database] — contains the entire text of &quot;Mo Letters&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his widow [[Karen Zerby]] became the leader of TFI.

The group's liberal sexuality led to concerns and investigations regarding child abuse. However every judicial and academic investigation of TFI (especially in the 1990s) has found TFI to be a safe environment for children. However, information provided by former members casts doubts as to whether these investigations really manage to uncover the truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwms&quot;&gt;Jones, K., Jones, C. &amp; Buhring, J. 2007 &quot;Not without my sister&quot;, Harpercollinspuplishing, London&lt;/ref&gt; TFI leadership have repeatedly apologized for cases where children were abused before 1986, when strict policies were set in place prohibiting excessive discipline or any sexual contact between adults and minors. Those found to have abused children since 1986 have been excommunicated from TFI membership. Again, it is unclear to what extent these policies and excommunications have been implemented in reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwms&quot; /&gt;

Media attention was renewed by the January 2005 suicide of David Berg's adopted and abused son/heir apparent [[Ricky Rodriguez]] (who had also left the group several years earlier) after he murdered a former member in, shocking both current and former members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/04/kaye.murdersuicide/index.html | work=CNN | title=Young man's suicide blamed on mother's cult - CNN.com | date=December 5, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The Children of God (1968–1977)===
Members of the Children of God founded [[commune (intentional community)|communes]], first called &quot;colonies&quot; but now referred to as &quot;homes,&quot; in various cities. They would [[proselytism|proselytize]] in the streets and distribute pamphlets.

New converts memorized [[scripture]], took Bible classes, and were expected to emulate the lives of early Christians while rejecting mainstream denominational Christianity. In common with converts to some other religions, most incoming members adopted a new &quot;Bible&quot; name.

The founder of the movement was a former [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] pastor, David Brandt Berg (1919–1994), also known within the group as Moses David, Mo, Father David, and Dad to adult group members, and eventually as Grandpa to the group's youngest members.

Berg communicated with his followers through more than 3,000 published letters written over 24 years, referred to as &quot;Mo Letters&quot; by members of the group. By January 1972, Berg introduced through his letters that he was God's prophet for this time, further establishing his spiritual authority within the group. Nonetheless, Berg freely acknowledged his failings and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Chancellor, James (2000). &quot;Life in The Family: An Oral History of the Children of God&quot;. ''University of Syracuse Press'', Syracuse, NY. pp. 64–67&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1972, COG members had distributed approximately 42 million Christian tracts, mostly on God's salvation and America's doom. Street distribution of Berg's Letters (called &quot;litnessing&quot;) became the COG's predominant method of both outreach and support for the next five years.

The Children of God ended as an organizational entity in February 1978. Berg reorganized the movement amid reports of serious misconduct, financial mismanagement, and established leaders having abused their positions (and others having opposed [[flirty fishing]]). He dismissed more than 300 of the movement's leaders and declared the general dissolution of the COG structure. This shift was known as the &quot;Reorganization Nationalization Revolution&quot; (RNR). A third of the total membership left the movement, and those who remained became part of the reorganized movement, dubbed the ''Family of Love'', and later ''the Family''. Most of the group's beliefs, however, remained the same.&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;''[http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/origins.htm The Origins of a Movement: From &quot;The Children of God&quot; to &quot;The Family International&quot;]'', found on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Family of Love (1978–1981)===
The ''Family of Love'' era was characterized by expansion into more countries. Regular proselytization methods included [[door-to-door]], distributing tracts and other gospel literature, and organized classes on various aspects of Christian life, with heavy use of TFI music.

In 1974, David Berg introduced a new proselytization method called [[Flirty Fishing]] (or FFing), which encouraged female members to show God's love by engaging in sexual activity with potential converts. Flirty Fishing was practiced by members of Berg's inner circle starting in 1973, and was later introduced to the general membership. By 1978, it was widely practiced by members of the group. In some areas, Flirty Fishers used escort agencies to meet people. According to TFI, as a result of Flirty Fishing, ''&quot;over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and [[missionary]].&quot;''&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; According to data provided by TFI to researcher Bill Bainbridge, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William Sims (1996). &quot;The Sociology of Religious Movements.&quot; ''Routledge.'' ISBN 0-415-91202-4. pg 223&lt;/ref&gt; Flirty Fishing also resulted in the births of many children, including Karen Zerby's son, [[Davidito]] (aka [[Ricky Rodriguez]]). Children born as result of Flirty Fishing were referred to as &quot;Jesus Babies.&quot; By the end of 1981, more than 300 &quot;Jesus Babies&quot; had been born.

In an official statement on its origins, TFI partly describes the practice of Flirty Fishing as follows:

{{quote|In part as a response to the sexual liberality of the early '70s, Father David presented a more intimate and personal, voluntary form of evangelism, which became known as 'Flirty Fishing' or 'FFing.' ...Father David proposed that the boundaries of expressing God's love to others could at times go beyond just showing kindness and doing good deeds. He suggested that for those who were in dire need of physical love and affection, even sex could be used as evidence to them of the Lord's love. ...The motivation, guiding principle, and reasoning behind the FFing ministry was that through this sacrificial proof of love, some would better accept and understand God's great love for them. The goal was that they would come to believe in and receive God's own loving gift of salvation through His Son, Jesus, who gave His life for them. By this unorthodox method David felt many would find the Lord's love and salvation, who never would have otherwise. ...
Although we no longer practice FFing, we believe the scriptural principles behind the ministry remain sound.&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt;}}

In his judgment of a child custody court case in England in 1994, after extensive research of COG publications and the testimony of numerous witnesses, Lord Justice Sir [[Alan Ward (judge)|Alan Ward]] said the following about Flirty Fishing:

{{quote|I am quite satisfied that most of the women who engaged in this activity and the subsequent refinement of ESing, (which was finding men through escort agencies), did so in the belief that they were spreading God's word. But I am also totally satisfied that that was not Berg's only purpose. He and his organization had another and more sordid reason. They were procuring women to become common prostitutes. They were knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution. That was criminal activity. Their attempts to deny this must be dismissed as cant and hypocrisy. To deny that the girls were acting as prostitutes because 'we are not charging but we expect people to show their thanks and their appreciation and they ought to give more for love than if we charged them' is an unacceptable form of special pleading. The 'FFers handbook' told the girls that fishing could be fun but fun did not pay the bills. 'You've got to catch a few to make the fun pay for itself. So don't do it for nothing.'&lt;ref name=&quot;WardJudgment&quot;&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Judgment_of_Lord_Justice_Ward Judgment of the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Ward] – 1995 judgment resulting from major UK custody case involving TF&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A judge in Italy came to a different conclusion in 1991, deciding that Flirty Fishing was not prostitution (see Tribunale Penale di Roma (Criminal Court of Rome), November 15, 1991, re: Berg and others, and in the archives of the Criminal Court of Rome (RG 3841/84)). The judge concluded that it was only in &quot;the last months of 1977 Berg started counseling the members that it was permissible for proselyting reasons to offer sexual contacts and services to perspective [sic] members, the more so when the latter were potentially good financial contributors to the cult.&quot; Among the Children of God, the judge argued, Flirty Fishing was not understood as prostitution but &quot;as a personal contribution to the humanitarian aims that the sect always claimed to pursue.&quot;

Flirty Fishing was officially abandoned in 1987 in favor of other [[Evangelism|witnessing]] methods and also to avoid contracting [[HIV]]. In 1987, new rules were introduced that banned, under penalty of [[excommunication]], sexual contact with non-members. However, the new rules also stated that exceptions to the rule would be allowed in certain cases. For example, one publication stated: &quot;All sex with outsiders is banned!--Unless they are already close and well-known friends!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exfamily.org/pubs/ml/b5/ml2531.shtml The Family: D.O. Is for DOers of the Word! (James 1:22)-Requirements for Receiving DO Mailings!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Family (1982–1994)===

By 1982, more TF members had moved to southern and eastern parts of the world. At the end of 1983, TF was reporting 10,000 fulltime members living in 1,642 TF homes. Additionally, TF's Music With Meaning radio club had by this time grown to almost 20,000 members. According to statistics by TF, at this time evangelization efforts were resulting in an average of 200,000 conversions to Christ and distribution of nearly 30 million pages of literature per month.

In March 1989, TF issued a statement which stated that, in &quot;early 1985&quot; an urgent memorandum was sent to all of its members ''&quot;reminding them that any such activities [adult-child sexual contact] are &lt;u&gt;strictly forbidden&lt;/u&gt; within our group.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Child Abuse?!&quot;&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Child_Abuse%3F%21 Child Abuse?!] (March 1989) (Hosted by [http://www.xFamily.org xfamily.org])&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis in original). In January 2005, Claire Borowik, spokesperson for TFI, issued a statement that said, &quot;Due to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not clearly stated in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newdaynews.com/resource/davidito/borowick-01.htm Claire Borowik&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1988, TF implemented a policy that forbade adult-child sexual contact on penalty of excommunication (expulsion from the movement). This policy was not retroactive. Members who filed charges or pursued other legal action against those excommunicated for child abuse were required to leave TF or move to a different membership status until the matter was resolved, as explained in the June 2003 Charter amendments&lt;ref name=&quot;Charter Amendments&quot;&gt;Charter Amendments, June 2003 ([http://www.xfamily.org/images/c/c5/CharterAmendments.pdf pdf]) (Hosted by [http://www.xFamily.org xfamily.org])&lt;/ref&gt; in the Rights of Children (pg. 22) and the Right of Redress (pg. 51) sections. However this clause is no longer valid under TFI's 2010 policies, and members can presently file charges and pursue legal action while retaining TFI membership.

In the 1990s, numerous allegations of child sexual abuse were brought against TF around the world, in locations including [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States|USA]], and [[Venezuela]].{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}} TFI leadership has maintained that they did not sanction or condone the sexual abuse of children, and government-led investigations and court cases did not find evidence of abuse in the 750 children they examined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some court documents can be found in the [[#Court cases|Court Cases]] section below.

Karen Zerby, writing in a 1995 internal publication titled &quot;''An Answer to Him That Asketh Us''&quot;, stated: &quot;Because of the insight Dad [Berg] gave into the Scriptures which granted us a great deal of sexual freedom, without clearly stated explicit restrictions that prohibited all sexual activity between adults and minors, it resulted in actions that caused harm to some children. He must therefore bear responsibility for the harm.  ... As the author of the Letters, he accepts the blame, but this doesn't mean that everyone else is completely blameless. Anyone who attempted to use the Law of Love to justify any unloving, selfish or hurtful behavior is responsible before God for it.&quot;

According to [[Eileen Barker]]'s book ''An Introduction to New Religious Movements'', the group has been acquitted of all charges of sexual abuse of children. Other researchers have concurred that there is no evidence of greater sexual activity amongst teenagers in TF than in society at large.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Nancy R. &quot;Correlates of Adolescent Sexual Activity in the Family&quot;, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transformation in the 1990s====
In the early 1990s, TF members took advantage of the newly opened Eastern Europe (following the fall of [[Communism]]) and expanded their evangelisation campaigns eastward, alongside many other religious groups. The production and dissemination of millions of pieces of Christian literature earned them the colloquial name &quot;the poster people.&quot;

The early 1990s also saw the launch of what TF termed their &quot;Consider the Poor&quot; (CTP) ministries. Expanding their outreach beyond evangelization, members began providing material aid to the poor and disadvantaged. TF members became active in disaster relief efforts, the provision and distribution of humanitarian aid, musical benefit programs for refugees, visitation to hospitals, and similar activities.

===The Family (1995–2003)===

After Berg's death in October 1994, [[Karen Zerby]], known in the group as Mama Maria, Queen Maria, Maria David, or Maria Fontaine, took over leadership of the group. She married her longtime partner, [[Steven Douglas Kelly]], an American known in the group as Peter Amsterdam or King Peter, who legally changed his name to Christopher Smith. He became her traveling representative due to Zerby's [[recluse|reclusive]] separation from most of her followers.

In February 1995, the group introduced the ''Love Charter'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefamily.org/dossier/charter/overview.htm An Overview of Our Governing Charter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which defined the rights and responsibilities of Charter members and Homes. The Charter also includes the &quot;''Fundamental Family Rules''&quot;, a summary of rules and guidelines from past TF publications which were still in effect with the enactment of the Charter.

The Charter established a new way of living within the organization, allowing members greater freedom to choose and follow their pursuits. The rights referred to in the Charter were what a member could expect to receive from the group and how members were to be treated by leadership and fellow members. The responsibilities referred to were what members were expected to give to the group if they wished to remain full-time members, including [[tithe|tithing]] ten percent of their income to World Services, giving three percent to the &quot;Family Aid Fund,&quot; set up to support needy field situations, and one percent to regional &quot;common pots&quot;, which are used for local projects, activities, and fellowships. The Charter has been subsequently amended over the years according to changes within the group. TFI's 2010 policies state that all members must tithe (give 10% of their income) or give a monthly contribution in order to retain membership.

In a 1995 British court case, [[The Right Honourable|the Rt. Hon.]] [[Alan Ward (judge)|Lord Justice Alan Ward]] decided that some members of the group had engaged in abusive sexual practices involving minors and that they had also engaged in severe [[corporal punishment]]. However, he concluded that TF had abandoned these practices and that they were a safe environment for children. Nevertheless, he did require that the group cease all corporal punishment of children in the United Kingdom and denounce any of Berg's writings that were &quot;responsible for children in TF having been subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour.&quot;

===The Family International (2004–present)===
In 2004, the movement's name was changed to The Family International. However, TFI homes were told that they could retain their former names so long as they do not conceal their affiliation with TFI.

In 2004, there were major internal changes in the group. Internal publications spoke of arresting a general trend towards a less dedicated lifestyle, and the need for recommitment to the group's mission of fervent evangelization. In the second half of 2004, a six-month renewal period was held to help members refocus their priorities. Membership was reorganized and new levels of membership were introduced. At that time membership was defined into the following categories: Family Disciples (FD), Missionary Members (MM), Fellow Members (FM), Active Members (AM), and General Members (GM).

The ''Love Charter'' governs FDs, while the ''Missionary Member Statutes'' and ''Fellow Member Statutes'' were written for the governance of TFI's Missionary member and Fellow Member circles, respectively. FD homes are reviewed every six months against an annunciated set of criteria.

According to TFI statistics, at the beginning of 2005 there were 1,238 TFI homes and 10,202 members worldwide. Of those, 266 Homes and 4884 members were FD, 255 Homes and 1,769 members were MM, and 717 Homes and 3,549 members were FM. Statistics on AM and GM categories are currently unavailable.

In 2010 TFI underwent major changes in policy and structure with the goal of allowing individuals more freedom in expressing their faith and in their lifestyle choices, and has issued the end of one era and the beginning of a new one. Members have had differing views about the drastic changes that were introduced, but most see the need for the new TFI introduced with the &quot;reboot&quot;, the term used for the restructuring process of TFI. Members are now able to make personal decisions on whether or not they choose to live communally, as well as matters such as education, employment options, relationships and marriage with non-members, and other personal and lifestyle choices that were previously regulated or influenced by TFI policies. Present TFI focus is on developing open minded and inclusive views and attitudes, care of elderly members and developing solid mission and charity works. See press release at http://24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/the-family-internationalrestructuring-for-the-future-154132.php

==Beliefs==
Theologians have placed TFI's basic [[theology]] within the historical Christian tradition, although they have numerous unorthodox beliefs. To some extent, they identify with [[fundamentalist]] Christianity, though their more radical beliefs and practices are generally regarded as non-traditional, even heretical, by many conservative and liberal Christians.

TFI teaches that the [[Bible]] is the inspired Word of God and sacred revelation. Group founder David Berg is regarded within the group{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} as the most important [[prophet]] of the [[end times]]. He is regarded as a prophet in that he passed on the message of God. The group believes Berg's spiritual &quot;mantle&quot; passed to his wife, [[Karen Zerby]], at his death. The officially published writings of both David Berg and Karen Zerby&lt;ref name=moletters/&gt; are regarded as part of the &quot;Word of God&quot; which carries the same weight as the Bible since they are considered divine revelations. These views on past writings and &quot;the word of God&quot; have been readressed with documents issued in 2010.

They believe that the [[Great Commission]] of evangelizing the world is the duty of every Christian, and that their lives should be dedicated to the service of God and others. They had several levels of membership, and the most committed, called &quot;Family Disciples,&quot; live [[commune (intentional community)|communally]]. They also encourage having children. While birth control was initially highly discouraged, the choice is currently left to the individual and is not uncommon in practice, though it was officially regarded as indicative of a lack of trust in God's plan. Birth control views were readressed in 2010, and Family doctrine and policy no longer influences choices regarding birth control.

A central tenet to their theology is the &quot;Law of Love,&quot; which, stated simply, claims that if a person's actions are motivated by unselfish, sacrificial love and are not intentionally hurtful to others, such actions are in accordance with Scripture and are, thus, lawful in the eyes of God. The romantic and sexual implication of this principle is also commonly known as polyamory &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory&gt;, although the &quot;Law of Love&quot; is believed by TFI to be the Scriptural foundation for every aspect of a Christian's life, not only romantic and sexual, and emphasizes unselfishness, giving, caring, respect, honesty, and other essential Christian values that should be enacted in everyday life (the Scriptural basis for this teaching can be found in Matthew 22:37 - 40 and in Galatians 5:14). They believe that this tenet supersedes all other Biblical laws, except those forbidding male [[homosexuality]], which they believe is [[sin]]. Female [[bisexuality]] is sanctioned, though female homosexuality at the complete exclusion of men is not permitted. They believe that God created [[human sexuality]], that it is a natural, emotional, and physical need, and that [[heterosexual]] relations between consenting adults is a pure and natural wonder of God's creation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/The_Devil_Hates_Sex &lt;cite&gt;The Devil Hates Sex! But God Loves It!&lt;/cite&gt;], by David Berg, May, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and permissible according to Scripture. Documents issued in 2010 expressed the need for more tolerant attitudes toward varying choices regarding sexuality. Since 2010, the age of consent in TFI is determined by local laws and regulations. Since 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Liberty_or_Stumbling_Block &lt;cite&gt;Liberty or Stumblingblock?&lt;/cite&gt;], by Sara Kelley, November, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; sex between minors and adults has been forbidden. Adult members may have sex with any other adult member of the opposite sex, and are encouraged to do so, regardless of marital status, as a way to foster unity and combat loneliness of those &quot;in need&quot;. This was commonly called &quot;sharing&quot;, or in some cases &quot;sacrificial sex&quot;. While TFI policy states that members should not be pressured to have sex against their will, numerous former members have alleged being coerced to &quot;share&quot; and subsequently cast as selfish or unloving when they did not. These views have been readressed in 2010, reflecting on the influence that past documents have had on TFI's culture, and addressing the need to change this aspect of TFI culture to reflect more respect for personal decisions regarding sexuality and more inclusiveness regarding differing personal views on sexuality.

They believe that they are now living in the time period known in the Bible as the &quot;[[End times|Last Days]]&quot; or the &quot;Time of the End,&quot; which is the era immediately preceding the return of Jesus Christ. Before that event, they believe that the world will be ruled for seven years by the [[Antichrist]], who will create a one-world government. At the half-way point in his rule he will become completely possessed by [[Satan]], precipitating a time of troubles known as the [[Great Tribulation]] which will bring intense [[persecution]] of Christians as well as stupendous natural and unnatural disasters. At the end of this period, faithful Christians will be taken to heaven in an event known as the [[Rapture]] that is shortly followed by a battle between Jesus and the Antichrist commonly known as the &quot;Battle of [[Armageddon]]&quot;, in which the Antichrist is defeated. Then, they say, Jesus Christ will reign on Earth for 1000 years, a period they call the [[Millennialism|Millennium]].

TFI's official summary statement of their beliefs can be found on their [http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/faith.htm website].

===Recent teachings===
TFI's recent teachings center around beliefs that they have termed the &quot;new [spiritual] weapons.&quot; TFI members believe that they are soldiers in the [[spiritual warfare|spiritual war]] of [[conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] for the souls and hearts of men. Although some of the following beliefs are not new to TFI, they have assumed greater importance in recent years.

====Prophecy====
:In TFI jargon, the popular definition of [[prophecy]]—a prediction of the future—has been expanded to refer to any message received from the &quot;spirit world&quot; from Jesus, deceased founder David Berg, or another &quot;spirit helper&quot; (see below). A great emphasis has been placed on each member regularly using prophecy to guide their daily lives. Although prophecy, also referred to as [[channeling (mediumistic)|channeling]], has been a part of the movement from the beginning, it has assumed greater significance under Karen Zerby's leadership.

====Spirit Helpers====
:These include [[angel]]s, departed humans, and even famous mythical characters, for example the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Spirit helpers are sent to give instruction and to fight in the spiritual warfare taking place in the spiritual dimension that TFI members believe is coexistent with the physical world that surrounds them. These helpers are believed to relay divine messages through prophecy and are also engaged in combat with [[Satan]] and his demons. TFI members believe that referring by name to spirit helpers when calling on their help, or demons when rebuking or cursing them, affords greater power to their prayers. As a result, TFI regularly publishes names of individual, as well groups of, spirit helpers and demons, linking them with their respective areas of power within the physical world.

====The Keys of the Kingdom====
:TFI believes that the keys referred to in the Biblical passage &quot;and I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven&quot; ({{bibleref|Matthew|16:19}}), have assumed greater significance today. As such, TFI members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for supposed extra effect during prayer. These spiritual keys are also believed to power various [[supernatural|spiritual]] [[spacecraft]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (known as Key Craft), and can turn into spiritual swords for the purpose of fighting demons and other negative forces.

====Loving Jesus====
:This is a term that TFI members use to describe their intimate, sexual relationship with [[Jesus]]. TFI describes the &quot;Loving Jesus&quot; teachings as a radical form of [[bridal theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/lj.htm The &quot;Loving Jesus&quot; Revelation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is their understanding of the Bible that the followers of Christ are his bride, called to love and serve him with the fervor of a wife. They took bridal theology further than mainstream Christians by encouraging members to imagine that Jesus is having sex with them during [[sexual intercourse]] and [[masturbation]]. Male members were encouraged to visualize themselves as women, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus.

TFI continues to stress the imminent [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]], preceded by the rise of a worldwide government led by the &quot;[[Antichrist]]&quot;. Doctrines regarding the &quot;[[end times]]&quot; influence virtually all long-term decision making. However documents issued in 2010 have changed this view to reflect a need for long-term plans and projects.

==Issues==
===Child abduction===
Since the late 1970s, there have been reports of children of former members being abducted and moved to other countries to prevent their parents, law enforcement authorities and child welfare agencies from finding them. An investigation into the whereabouts of four missing children, whose mother, Ruth Frouman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Ruth_Frouman Ruth Frouman – XFamily – Children of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was expelled from the group in July 1987, eight months after being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], and not allowed to leave with her children, resulted in police raids&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Legal_Case_Argentina%2C_1993 Legal Case Argentina, 1993 – XFamily – Children of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; on ten TFI homes in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September 1993. After holding a large number of TFI children in custody and conducting many physical and psychological examinations on the children, the court returned the children to their parents, citing lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Tribunal_de_Menores_de_Mercedes_-_Case_number_32.202 Tribunal de Menores de Mercedes – Cause number 32.202 – XFamily – Children of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Ruth Frouman's children were returned to their father in May 1993, and the other two children were reunited with their father and their other relatives in mid-1997.

Although official TFI spokespersons have rarely made any public statements about specific [[child abduction]] cases involving its members, TFI's policies and practices regarding child custody were better defined in the mid-1990s with the introduction of the &quot;Love Charter&quot;, TFI's governing document which was introduced in February 1995, several months after the death of its founder. In Section 60 of this document, ''Permanent Marital Separation Rules'', states that couples with children must come to a mutual written agreement regarding the separation and the custody of the children and that obtaining a legal divorce and child custody order is optional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xfamily.org/images/2/2d/Charter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This policy stated that it only applied to marital separations after February 1995. The June 2003 amendments state that if the parties involved cannot reach a mutual agreement and &quot;opt to use the court system to settle the matter,&quot; they must &quot;relinquish Charter membership until the matter is settled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charter Amendments&quot;/&gt; This clause is no longer valid under TFI's 2010 policies, and members may settle the matter in a court of law while retaining membership.

One TFI member, Peter Bevan Riddell, is known to have been convicted of crimes relating to child abduction. In 1984, the Australian government canceled Riddell's passport and he was deported from Japan to Australia, where he was convicted of committing forgery and making false statements to facilitate unlawful abduction. He later returned to Japan, where he continued working on behalf of David Berg and Karen Zerby in World Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Peter_Bevan_Riddell Peter Bevan Riddell – XFamily – Children of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another TFI member, Brian Edward Pickus, has been wanted for decades on an [[Interpol]] warrant issued by the United States and the state of Hawaii for kidnapping, burglary and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Brian_Edward_Pickus_-_Argentina_Extradition_Case Brian Edward Pickus – Argentina Extradition Case – XFamily – Children of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second generation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
Second-generation adults, adults who were born and/or reared in TFI, are known in the group as &quot;SGAs&quot; and have assumed many leadership positions in the organization. This includes chairmanships of international, regional, and national boards.

However, as with other high-commitment religious groups, many second-generation members have left to pursue secular careers or higher education and to rear their children in an environment different from the one they were reared in. There is a great deal of anti-TFI sentiment among a small but outspoken minority of those who have left (some examples are Celeste Jones, Kristina Jones, and Julianna Buhring, who wrote a book&lt;ref name=&quot;nwms&quot; /&gt; on their lives in TFI &lt;ref&gt;http://www.notwithoutmysister.com/bios.php&lt;/ref&gt;). The anti-TFI sentiment includes threats to legally pursue alleged physical and sexual abusers, who, some allege, have been shielded from prosecution by the group's leadership.

Many of these former [[Missionary Kids]] have returned to the country of their citizenship and have, thus, become [[Third Culture Kids]] (TCKs). Many have also kept in communication with each other. A notable example of this is their use of the site MovingOn.org,&lt;ref name=MovingOn&gt;[http://www.movingon.org/ MovingOn.org] – Community site for former second-generation members of TFI&lt;/ref&gt; established by a former second-generation member in 2001 (closed down as of 1 February 2009).

Many who have remained in the group have been vocal in their defense of TFI's lifestyle; for example, at MyConclusion.com,&lt;ref name=MyConclusion&gt;[http://www.myconclusion.com MyConclusion.com] – Opinions and responses by current second-generation members with positive viewpoints about TFI&lt;/ref&gt; a site established by second-generation members of TFI shortly after the January 2005 murder-suicide of Rick Rodriguez and Angela Smith.

Members of TFI are encouraged to maintain friendly relations with relatives who have left. However, they have also been discouraged from associating with relatives who are considered enemies of TFI and who have frequently appeared on television programs around the world to denounce and speak out against the group.

There are some former second-generation members who have reported crimes to law enforcement agencies, testified against the group in court cases involving its members, and publicly expressed negative opinions about the group's members and practices. In the past TFI has used the sociological/religious term [[apostate]]s to describe these former members and has argued that their testimony is unreliable and less credible than that of current members. Some TFI members have argued that second-generation members who alleged they were abused in the group are mentally unstable, [[demonic possession|demonically possessed]], or highly paid by the anti-cult movement to lie about TFI. Some second-generation former members resent the apostate label, as most of them did not make the choice to join the group and thus feel they cannot rightly be called apostates. Negative terms relating to former members have been officially discouraged since documents issued in 2009. These documents addressed the need for understanding and respect for the decisions made by former members, and the need to support them in establishing themselves outside of the group.

===Secrecy===
TFI members are expected to respect the legal and civil authorities of countries in which they live; and members have typically cooperated with appointed authorities, even during the police and social service raids of their communities in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William Sims (2002). &quot;The Endtime Family: Children of God&quot;. ''State University of New York Press'', Albany, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a controversial belief that was taught and practiced by members of the group maintains that it is right to lie to non-members (or &quot;unbelievers&quot;) to protect God's work. This belief is commonly referred to as &quot;deceivers yet true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/Deceivers_yet_true Deceivers yet true – XFamily – Children of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A consistent trait throughout the history of TFI has been their aversion to government oversight and extreme secrecy surrounding leadership and finances. World Services (WS), the central administrative wing of TFI, continues to operate in seclusion, with very few members of TFI knowing its whereabouts. In 2010, this policy changed, and information about the location of WS centers is available to members of the group.

It is not uncommon for senior leaders to legally change their names. There have been allegations that members of TFI, including senior leaders, have used forged or fraudulently obtained passports and other identity documents from Australia, Canada, the United States, and other countries. Senior leadership typically still attempt to keep their legal names from common circulation, although this has become more difficult through the second half of the 1990s, because of legal action in many countries. In particular, a major court case in England brought to light many formerly guarded names of senior members.

In TFI's publications, printed photographs of WS members were typically censored by means of a rudimentary pencil drawing over the person's face. It was not uncommon in TFI-produced art for Berg's head to be replaced with that of a lion.

Following the death of David Berg in 1994, members of TF and the public were finally allowed to see up-to-date photographs of the organization's late founder. For many members, this was the first time they had seen a photograph of his face. In recent years{{When|date=February 2011}}, Steven Kelly has carried pictures of Karen Zerby with him on travels to show members, since most had never seen a picture of their spiritual leader prior to this. Although, by now, most of the group's members have seen photographs or video footage of Karen Zerby and Steven Kelly, their identities and location are still heavily guarded by members working closest to them. Recent{{When|date=February 2011}} photographs or video footage of Karen Zerby, Steven Kelly, and most WS members were not readily available even to full-time members of TFI until March 2005, when several recent photographs were leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Category:Photos_of_Family_Leaders Photos of TFI leaders]&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time that recent photographs of Karen Zerby were made available to the public in nearly 30 years. Due to developments in TFI policy made in 2009, the issue of secrecy is no longer valid. Pictures of and writings by Karen Zerby and Steve Kelly can be found at http://karenzerby.org/.

===Finances===
TFI finances are based on a system of [[tithe|tithing]]. Ten percent of all members' income is required to be donated to World Services. A further three percent is donated to regional offices for locally administered projects and a community lending program, and an additional one percent is given for regional literature publishing. Supplementary giving to TFI offices and leadership, beyond the typical 14% of income, is encouraged, and fairly common in practice. Present requirements for TFI membership include tithing 10% (or a monthly contribution), and these funds are reinvested in TFI services and projects benefitting TFI members.

Income to the group's members is primarily through individual donations which are solicited by the group with the understanding that the money will be used to help local charities. The percentage of donations used for local charities has not always been tracked or published by the group. Additional sources of income have come from selling products such as children's videos and music sold under a variety of names such as the Treasure Attic and Kiddy Viddy series. Posters have also been sold on the street for donations. In recent years many TFI members have worked to establish associations and foundations and are subject to the accounting and auditing regulations of the countries in which they are established, and since 2008, TFI documents have focused on and emphasized the need for transparency and sustainability of charity works managed by TFI members.

A study of how TFI channels funds around the world is interesting from a sociological angle since it depends largely on trust of carefully placed, non-senior members who typically manage bank accounts that contain organization funds in their own names. Despite this, very little graft has been experienced, and notable cases have involved insubstantial amounts of money.

Organization literature includes many discussions of impending global financial doom. As a result, TFI has gone to considerable lengths to avoid investments and actions that it deems unstable in the event of a financial crash. Typically, reserves are stored in Japanese yen, Swiss francs, or gold. TFI has consistently avoided property investments and stocks or bonds, believing them to be contrary to the scriptural requirements for Christian discipleship and their [[end times|end time]] beliefs. Since many TFI members are now working to establish enterprises and the endtime belief has been addressed to reflect a need for long term planning and preparation, long term investments by TFI members will likely become more common.

==Reception==
The group has been heavily criticized by the press and the [[anti-cult movement]]. In 1971, an organization called [[FREECOG]] was founded by concerned family members of followers, including [[deprogramming|deprogrammer]] [[Ted Patrick]], to &quot;free&quot; them from their involvement in the group.

Frequently, critics of the movement cite the writings of David Berg, as well as incidents of alleged criminal behavior by individuals. TFI members, meanwhile, state that the entirety of Berg's writings do not reflect the organization's fundamental beliefs (contained in the &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;) or policies (contained in the Love Charter, published in 1995). Likewise, they reject the concept of the entire group being blamed for the wrongdoing of individuals, even when involving members at the highest levels of leadership.

Due to the high commitment nature of the group, controversy over the movement tends to generate strong feelings in both current and former members. An example of the contrasting interpretations of TFI life can be seen in the accounts of second generation members: former members at [http://www.movingon.org/abuse.asp MovingOn.org] and (mostly) current members at MyConclusion.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;MyConclusion&quot;/&gt;

==Programs, projects, and productions==
TFI has numerous programs, local foundations, and projects through which it operates around the world. The largest of these are the &quot;Family Care Foundation&quot; (FCF), &quot;Aurora Production AG&quot;, and &quot;Activated Ministries&quot;. The lattermost of these is a [[California]]-based [[nonprofit organization]] which conducts [[missionary]] work.

==Leadership and management==
The leadership of TFI is headed by:
*[[Karen Elva Zerby]]
**Spiritual leader of TFI
**American
**Legally changed her name to Katherine Rianna Smith, 4 November 1997
**Aliases:
***Karen Elva Zerby
***Katherine Rianna Smith
***Maria David
***Maria Berg
***Maria Fontaine
***Mama Maria
***Queen Maria

*Steven Douglas Kelly
**Head leader of TFI
**American
**Legally changed his name to Christopher Smith
**Aliases:
***Steven Douglas Kelly
***Christopher Smith
***Peter Amsterdam
***King Peter

Under them, management is divided into ''World Services'', ''Creations'', and ''Family Care Foundation''. Each region is managed by a team of Continental Officers (COs), each team typically having five to seven members. The management structures beneath the CO team are more variable and their members are changed frequently.

==Statistics==
According to the Children of God, there were 130 [[Intentional Community|communes]] or &quot;colonies&quot; in 15 countries in 1972. In 1993, 7,000 of the 10,000 members were under 18 years of age. Recent statistics by TFI puts full-time and fellow members at just over 11,200 in over 100 countries (around 4,000 adult full-time members and 4,000 children). Some estimates have placed the total number of people that have passed through the group at 35,000.

==Notable members (past and present)==
*[[Jeremy Spencer]], renowned [[blues]] [[slide guitar]]ist and a founding member of [[Fleetwood Mac]] (of which he was a member until 1971), and a current member of TFI since 1971.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Raised in COG as children===
*[[Celeste Jones]] — author of ''[[Not Without My Sister]]'', an autobiography detailing the extensive abuse she suffered in COG.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notwithoutmysister.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; This book is used by the organization [[RAINN]] as a reference for [[child sexual abuse]] victims.
*[[Rose McGowan]] — an actress, described her childhood in the group in interviews with [[Howard Stern]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard Stern radio broadcast.

[http://www.RoseMcGowanOnline.com/press/1997/111/ Rose McGowan]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Actors [[River Phoenix]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Rain Phoenix]], and [[Summer Phoenix]], as well as sister Liberty Phoenix, were members of the cult from 1972–1978. River Phoenix, who died of a drug overdose in 1993, told [[Details (magazine)|''Details'']] magazine in November 1991 that &quot;they're ruining people's lives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

*A 15th-season episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', titled &quot;Sects&quot; (originally broadcast March 30, 2005), featured a group that was reminiscent of the Children of God, with an abusive female cult leader (&quot;Mrs. Shelby,&quot; based on Children of God leader [[Karen Zerby]] and played by Deborah Hedwall). The episode also featured an adult child of hers who commits murder, based on the Ricky Rodriguez incident.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The '''Code of Hammurabi''' is a well-preserved [[Babylonia]]n [[law code]], dating to ca. 1700 BC ([[short chronology]]).  It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world.  The sixth Babylonian king, [[Hammurabi]], enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone [[stele]] and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting &quot;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&quot; (''lex talionis'')&lt;ref&gt;Review: The Code of Hammurabi, J. Dyneley Prince, The American Journal of Theology Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jul., 1904), pp. 601-609 Published by: The University of Chicago Press Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3153895 &lt;/ref&gt; as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar&quot;&gt;[[Gabriele Bartz]], Eberhard König, (Arts and Architecture), Könemann, Köln, (2005), ISBN 3833119438. The laws were based with scaled punishments, adjusting &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; depending on social status.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly one-half of the Code deals with matters of contract, establishing for example the wages to be paid to ox driver or a surgeon.  Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a  house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another.  Approximately a third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity and sexual behavior.  Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html Code of Hammurabi&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of provisions address issues related to military service.  

One nearly complete example of the Code survives today, on a [[diorite]] [[stele]] in the shape of a huge [[index finger]],&lt;ref&gt;Iconographic Evidence for Some Mesopotamian Cult Statues, Dominique Collon, Die Welt der Götterbilder, Edited by Groneberg, Brigitte; , Spieckermann, Hermann; , and Weiershäuser, Frauke, Berlin, New York (Walter de Gruyter) 2007 Pages 57–84&lt;/ref&gt; 2.25&amp;nbsp;m or 7.4&amp;nbsp;ft tall (''see images at right''). The Code is inscribed in the [[Akkadian language]], using [[cuneiform script]] carved into the stele, today on display in the [[Louvre]], in Paris.

==History==
[[Hammurabi]] ruled for 42 years, 1792 to 1750 BC, in the preface to the law code, he states, ''&quot;Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule in the land.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;wsu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM|title=Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=Washington State University|year=1996|author=Edited by Richard Hooker; Translated by L.W King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 Egyptologist [[Gustave Jéquier]], a member of an expedition headed by [[Jacques de Morgan]], found the stele containing the Code of Hammurabi in what is now [[Khūzestān]], [[Iran]] (ancient [[Susa]], [[Elam]]), where it had been taken as plunder by the Elamite king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] in the 12th century B.C.E.

It is currently on display at the [[Louvre]], in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;louvre1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Gabriele Bartz, Eberhard König.|title=Louvre ( Arts and Architecture) |publisher=Könemann |location=Köln |year= 2005|pages= |isbn=3-8331-1943-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
{{Main|Babylonian law}} The Code of Hammurabi was one of several sets of laws in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yale&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm|title=The Code of Hammurabi: Translated by L. W. King|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=Yale University|year=2005|author= L. W. King}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier collections of laws include the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], king of [[Ur]] (ca. 2050 BC), the [[Laws of Eshnunna]] (ca. 1930 BC) and the codex of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]] (ca. 1870 BC), while later ones include the [[Hittite laws]], the [[Assyrian law]]s, and [[Mosaic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barton, G.A: ''Archaeology and the Bible''. University of Michigan Library, 2009, (originally published in 1916 by American Sunday-School Union) p.406.&lt;/ref&gt;
These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.&lt;ref&gt;Barton 2009, p.406. Barton, a professor of Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1931, stated that while there are similarities between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi, a study of the entirety of both laws ''&quot;convinces the student that the laws of the Old Testament are in no essential way dependent upon the Babylonian laws.&quot;'' He states that ''&quot;such resemblances&quot;'' arose from ''&quot;a similarity of antecedents and of general intellectual outlook&quot;'' between the two cultures, but that ''&quot;the striking differences show that there was no direct borrowing.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Code-de-Hammurabi-1.jpg|thumb|150px|Side view of the stele &quot;fingertip&quot;.]]
The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental [[law]] regulating a government &amp;mdash; i.e., a primitive form of what is now known as a [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;What is a Constitution? William David Thomas, Gareth Stevens (2008) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flach, Jacques.  Le Code de Hammourabi et la constitution originaire de la propriete dans l'ancienne Chaldee. (Revue historique.  Paris, 1907. 8. v. 94, p. 272-289.&lt;/ref&gt;  The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of [[presumption of innocence]], and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt; Victimology:Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr,Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the Code may be better read as a codification of supplementary judicial decisions of the king. Rather than being a modern legal code or constitution, it may have as its purpose the self-glorification of Hammurabi by memorializing his wisdom and justice. Its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;For this alternative interpretation see Jean Bottéro, &quot;The 'Code' of Hammurabi&quot; in ''Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods'' (University of Chicago, 1992), pp. 156-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Here are nineteen example laws, in their entirety, of the [http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM Code of Hammurabi], translated into English:
*If anyone ensnares another, putting a ban upon him, but he cannot prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to [[capital punishment|death]].
*If anyone brings an accusation against a man, and the accused goes to the river and leaps into the river, if he sinks in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house. But if the river proves that the accused is not guilty, and he escapes unhurt, then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death, while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser.
*If anyone find runaway male or female slaves in the open country and bring them to their masters, the master of the slaves shall pay him two shekels of silver. 
*If anyone brings an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if a capital offense is charged, be put to death.
*If a builder builds a house for someone, and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls in and kills its owner, then the builder shall be put to death. (Another variant of this is, If the owner's son dies, then the builder's son shall be put to death.)
*If a son strikes his father, his hands shall be hewn off.
*If a man gives his child to a nurse and the child dies in her hands, but the nurse, unbeknown to the father and mother, nurses another child, then they shall convict her of having nursed another child without the knowledge of the father and mother and her breasts shall be cut off.
*If anyone steals the minor son of another, he will be put to death.
*If a man takes a woman as a wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him.
*If a man strike a free-born woman so that she lose her unborn child, he shall pay ten shekels for her loss.
*If a man puts out the eye of a patrician, his eye shall be put out. 
*If a man knocks the teeth out of another man, his own teeth will be knocked out.
*If anyone strikes the body of a man higher in rank than he, he shall receive sixty blows with an ox-whip in public.
*If a freeborn man strikes the body of another freeborn man of equal rank, he shall pay one gold [[Mina (unit)|mina]].
*If the slave of a freed man strikes the body of a freed man, his ear shall be cut off.
*If anyone commits a robbery and is caught, he shall be put to death.
*If anyone opens his ditches to water his crop, but is careless, and the water floods his neighbor's field, he shall pay his neighbor corn for his loss.
*If a judge tries a case, reaches a decision, and presents his judgment in writing; and later it is discovered that his decision was in error, and it was his own fault, he shall pay twelve times the fine set by him in the case and be removed from the judge's bench.

There are 282 such [[laws]] in the Code of Hammurabi, each usually no more than a sentence or two.  The 282 laws are bracketed by a Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself, and an Epilogue in which he sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws.

==Other copies==
Various copies of portions of the Code of Hammurabi have been found on baked clay tablets, some possibly older than the celebrated [[diorite]] stele now in the Louvre. The Prologue of the Code of Hammurabi (the first 305 inscripted squares on the stele) is on such a tablet, also at the Louvre (Inv #AO 10237). Some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by Hammurabi may imply that it is older than the famous stele (it is currently dated to the early 18th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Fant, Clyde E. and Mitchell G. Reddish (2008), [http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj6zVQJz7zYC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Code+of+Hammurabi%22+AND+2358&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h-WEMEm_S7&amp;sig=otruVc43aRR7ge-2v-78tcMQih8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tU1iSrvWNdmOtgfjr9EC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 ''Lost Treasures of the Bible: Understanding the Bible Through Archaeological Artifacts in World Museums''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., pg 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Museum of the Ancient Orient]], part of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]], also has a &quot;Code of Hammurabi&quot; clay tablet, dated to 1750 BC, in (Room 5, Inv # Ni 2358).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Freely|Freely, John]], ''Blue Guide Istanbul'' (5th ed., 2000), [[London]]: [[A&amp;C Black]], [[New York]]: [[WW Norton]], pg 121. (&quot;The most historic of the inscriptions here [i.e., Room 5, Museum
of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul] is the famous Code of Hammurabi (#Ni 2358) dated 1750 BC, the world's oldest recorded set of laws.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=13150 Museum of the Ancient Orient website] (&quot;This museum contains a rich collection of ancient ... archaeological finds, including ... seals from Nippur and a copy of the Code of Hammurabi.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 2010, archaeologists reported that a fragmentary Akkadian cuneiform tablet was discovered at [[Tel Hazor]], [[Israel]], containing a ca. 1700 BC text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the Hammurabi code. The Hazor law code fragments are currently being prepared for publication by a team from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138788  Tablet Discovered by Hebrew U Matches Code of Hammurabi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cuba Libre''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkuβa ˈliβɾe}}, {{IPA-en|ˈkjuːbə ˈliːbreɪ|lang}}, &quot;Free Cuba&quot;) is a [[highball]] made of [[Cola]], [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]], and white [[rum]]. This highball is often referred to as a '''Rum and Coke''' in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]], where the lime juice is optional.

==History==
Accounts of the invention of the Cuba Libre vary. One account claims that the drink ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''Free [[Cuba]]'') was invented in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] around 1901/1902. Patriots aiding Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]] — and, later, expatriates avoiding [[Prohibition]] regularly mixed rum and Cola as a highball and a toast to this West Indies island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Original BACARDI Cuba Libre Celebrates 110th Anniversary|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100803005466/en/Original-BACARDI-Cuba-Libre-Celebrates-110th-Anniversary|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=24 January 2011|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''According to [[Bacardi]]''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world's second most popular drink was born in a collision between the United States and [[Spain]]. It happened during the Spanish-American War at the turn of the century when [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]], the [[Rough Riders]], and [[United States|Americans]] in large numbers arrived in Cuba. One afternoon, a group of off-duty soldiers from the U.S. Signal Corps were gathered in a bar in Old Havana. Fausto Rodriguez, a young messenger, later recalled that Captain Russell came in and ordered Bacardi (Gold) rum and Coca-Cola on ice with a wedge of lime. The captain drank the concoction with such pleasure that it sparked the interest of the soldiers around him. They had the bartender prepare a round of the captain's drink for them. The Bacardi rum and Coke was an instant hit. As it does to this day, the drink united the crowd in a spirit of fun and good fellowship. When they ordered another round, one soldier suggested that they toast ''¡Por Cuba Libre!'' in celebration of the newly freed Cuba. The captain raised his glass and sang out the battle cry that had inspired Cuba's victorious soldiers in the War of Independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuba-libre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuba Libre History|url=http://www.havana-club.com/INT/EN/club.html#/467|publisher=Havana Club|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are some problems with Bacardi's account, as the Spanish-American war was fought in 1898, Cuba's liberation was in 1898, and the Rough Riders left Cuba in September 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rough Riders and Colonel Roosevelt |url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/Rough_Riders.htm|publisher=Theodore Roosevelt Association|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Coca-Cola was not available in Cuba until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chronicle Of Coca-Cola|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/heritage/chronicle_man_named_woodruff.html|work=Heritage|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1965 deposition by [[Fausto Rodriguez]], the Cuba Libre was first mixed at a Cuban bar in August 1900 by a member of the U.S. Signal Corps, referred to as &quot;[[John Doe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;coulombe&quot;&gt;{{cite book

* '''According to [[Havana Club]]''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Along with the [[Mojito]] and the [[Daiquiri]], the Cuba Libre shares the mystery of its exact origin. The only certainty is that this cocktail was first sipped in Cuba. The year? 1900. 1900 is generally said to be the year that cola first came to Cuba, introduced to the island by American troops. But “Cuba Libre!” was the battle cry of the Cuba Liberation Army during the war of independence that ended in 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuba-libre&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popularity==
This drink was once viewed as exotic, with its dark syrup, made (at that time) from [[cola nuts]] and [[coca]].

Soon enough, as [[Charles H. Baker, Jr.]] points out in his ''Gentlemen's Companion'' of 1934, the Cuba Libre &quot;caught on everywhere throughout [[U.S. Southern States|the [American] South]] ... filtered through the North and West,&quot; aided by the ample supply of its ingredients. In ''The American Language'', 1921, [[H.L. Mencken]] writes of an early variation of the drink: &quot;The [[troglodytes]] of western [[South Carolina]] coined 'jump stiddy' for a mixture of Coca-Cola and [[denatured alcohol]] (usually drawn from automobile radiators); connoisseurs reputedly preferred the taste of what had been aged in [[Model-T|Model-T Fords]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coulombe&quot;/&gt;

The drink gained further popularity in the United States after [[the Andrews Sisters]] recorded a song (in 1945) named after the drink's ingredients, &quot;[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]&quot;. Cola and rum were both cheap at the time and this also contributed to the widespread popularity of the concoction.&lt;ref name=&quot;coulombe&quot;/&gt;

== Recipe variations ==
{{Ref improve section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:Cuba Libre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Cuba Libre]]
The '''Cuba Pintada''' (&quot;stained Cuba&quot;) is one part rum with two parts [[club soda]] and just enough cola so that it tints the club soda. The '''Cuba Campechana''' (&quot;straightforward Cuba&quot;) contains one part rum topped off with equal parts of club soda and cola. They are both popular refreshments, especially among young people.

A recent variation is the '''[[Coppertone]]''' which uses [[Malibu Rum]] (rum with a natural coconut extract) and [[Cherry Coke]] for the cola component. The resulting drink smells like suntan lotion and the name is an allusion to that.

Other recent variations are the '''Cuba Light''' made with rum and [[Diet Coke]], and the '''Witch Doctor''' made with [[dark rum]] and [[Dr. Pepper]].

Another variation of the Cuba Libre is the '''Cuban Missile Crisis'''. Compared to a normal Cuba Libre, it uses a higher proof rum, such as [[Bacardi 151]] (75.5%).

A variation of the Cuba Libre popular in the West Indies is a '''“Hot” Cuba Libre''' which includes a splash of Caribbean [[hot sauce]] (for example, Capt'n Sleepy's Quintessential Habanero, or Matouk's).

Some people substitute Cream Soda and spiced rum to create a bright gold drink, often referred to as a [[Midas]].

Another recent variation is the '''Venezuela Libre''', inspired by the increasing cooperation between the governments of [[Venezuela]] and Cuba. It has {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}} of Venezuelan White Rum, {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}} of Venezuelan Gold Rum, {{convert|3|USfloz|ml}} of lemon mix, 1 lemon wedge and a dash of angostura bitters, and diet cola in place of normal cola.

== Local variations ==
{{Ref improve section|date=October 2010}}
The drink's name has evolved somewhat in both Cuba and the United States, where some choose to refer to it as a '''Mentirita''' (&quot;a little lie&quot;), in an opinionated reference to Cuban politics.

In [[Nicaragua]], when it is mixed using [[Flor de Caña]] (the national brand of rum) and cola, it is called a '''Nica Libre'''.

In [[Venezuela]] the '''Cuba Libre Preparado''' (&quot;Prepared Cuba Libre&quot;) includes a dash of [[gin]] and a dash of [[Angostura bitters]].

In [[Spain]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] Cuba Libre is also called &quot;Ron-Cola&quot; and &quot;Cubata&quot;.

In [[Australia]], the more popularly known drink is simply '''Rum and Coke''' or &quot;Rumbo&quot;, which contains no lime, commonly uses a local dark rum and can be purchased in cans as a ready-to-drink. However, the combination of light rum, brown sugar and cola is commonly ordered at cocktail bars as a ''Cuba Libre''.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the drink is most commonly served without the lime juice and ordered simply as a '''Bacardi and Coke''' {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. When the lime juice is included and rubbed around the rim of the glass it can be known as a [[Lou Bega]], after the popular singer. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In [[Peru]], a variation called '''Peru Libre''' is made with [[pisco]] rather than [[rum]].

In the [[Netherlands]] the drink is commonly called '''Baco''', from the two ingredients of [[Bacardi]] rum and cola.

In [[Poland]], when it is mixed using [[Burn (energy drink)|Burn]] and rum, it is called a '''Poland Libre'''. This, because Burn is a popular drink to mix in Poland and the drink turns red (the color of Poland).

In [[Russia]] Cuba Libre without the lime juice is called '''Rock-n-Roll Star''', after a popular song that features the recipe. Any distilled spirit could be substituted for a rum in a pinch, but these variations generally don't have any specific names.

In [[Dominican Republic]], it is the most popular drink to enjoy, poured with a very generous amount of locally produced Dominican Rum (i.e. Brugal, Bermúdez, and so on.) and Coke, topped off with a slice of lime. Domincans often call &quot;cuba libre&quot; &quot;mentirilla&quot; or little lie as a joke, it all started at the end of the cold war.

In [[Brazil]], there is another variation, made with &quot;[[cachaça]]&quot; and lemon without peeling.

In Greece [[Thessaloniki]], there is another variant, that consists of &quot;[[retsina]]&quot; and cola, named &quot;tumba libre&quot; (Tumba is the local team stadium [[PAOK F.C.]])

The weak and the strong '''Cosmic Censorship Hypotheses''' are two mathematical conjectures about the structure of [[gravitational singularity|singularities]] arising in [[general relativity]].

Singularities that arise in the [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solutions]] of [[Einstein's field equation|Einstein's equations]] are typically hidden within [[event horizon]]s, and therefore cannot be seen from the rest of spacetime. Singularities which are not so hidden are called ''[[naked singularity|naked]]''.   
The '''weak cosmic censorship hypothesis''' conjectures that no naked singularities other than the [[Big Bang]] singularity exist in the [[universe]]. The hypothesis was conceived by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969. Cosmic censorship hypotheses should be distinguished from chronological censorship under which every [[closed timelike curve]] passes through an event horizon, which might prevent an observer from detecting the causal violation.[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9]

==Basics==
Since the physical behavior of singularities is unknown, if singularities can be observed from the rest of spacetime, [[causality]] may break down, and [[physics]] may lose its predictive power. The issue cannot be avoided, since according to the [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]], singularities are inevitable in physically reasonable situations. Still, in the absence of naked singularities, the universe is [[determinism|deterministic]] &amp;mdash; it's possible to predict the entire evolution of the universe (possibly excluding some finite regions of space hidden inside event horizons of singularities), knowing only its condition at a certain moment of time (more precisely, everywhere on a [[spacelike]] 3-dimensional hypersurface, called the [[Cauchy surface]]). Failure of the cosmic censorship hypothesis leads to the failure of determinism, because it is yet impossible to predict the behavior of space-time in the causal future of a singularity.  Cosmic censorship is not merely a problem of formal interest; some form of it is assumed whenever [[black hole]] event horizons are mentioned.

The hypothesis was first formulated by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969, and it is not stated in a completely formal way. In a sense it is more of a research program proposal: part of the research is to find a proper formal statement that is physically reasonable and that can be proved to be true or false (and that is sufficiently general to be interesting).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/nyt_bet_story.html A Bet on a Cosmic Scale, And a Concession, Sort Of (New York Times, February 12, 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weak and strong cosmic censorship hypothesis ==

The weak and the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis are two conjectures concerned with the global geometry of spacetimes.
* The '''weak cosmic censorship hypothesis''' asserts there can be no singularity visible from [[future null infinity]]. In other words, singularities need to be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a black hole.
Mathematically, the conjecture states that, for generic initial data, the maximal Cauchy development possesses a complete future null infinity.

* The '''strong cosmic censorship hypothesis''' asserts that, generically, general relativity is a deterministic theory, in the same sense that classical mechanics is a deterministic theory. In other words, the classical fate of all observers should be predictable from the initial data. Mathematically, the conjecture states that the maximal Cauchy development of generic compact or asymptotically flat initial data is locally inextendible as a regular [[Lorentzian manifold]].

The two conjectures are mathematically independent, as there exist spacetimes for which the weak cosmic censorship is valid but the strong cosmic censorship is violated and conversely, there exist spacetimes for which the weak cosmic censorship is violated but the strong cosmic censorship is valid.

==Example==
The [[Kerr Metric]], corresponding to a black hole of mass M and angular momentum J, can be used to derive the [[effective potential]] for particle [[orbits]] restricted to the equator (as defined by rotation).  This potential looks like:&lt;ref name=&quot;hartle_gravity&quot;&gt;James B Hartle, ''Gravity'' in chapter 15: Rotating Black Holes. (2003. ISBN 0-8053-8662-9)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_{eff}(r,e,l)=-\frac{M}{r}+\frac{l^2-a^2(e^2-1)}{2r^2}-\frac{M(l-ae^2)}{r^3},~~~
a\equiv \frac{J}{M} &lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate radius, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are the test-particle's conserved energy and angular momentum respectively (constructed from the [[killing vectors]]).

To preserve ''cosmic censorship'', the black hole is restricted to the case of &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  For there to exist an [[event horizon]] around the [[singularity]], the requirement: &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; must be satisfied:.&lt;ref name=&quot;hartle_gravity&quot; /&gt;  This amounts to the [[angular momentum]] of the black hole being constrained to below a critical value, outside of which the horizon would disappear.  

The following thought experiment is reproduced from Hartle's ''Gravity'':

Imagine specifically trying to violate the censorship conjecture.  This could be done by somehow imparting an angular momentum upon the black hole, making it exceed the critical value (assume it starts infinitesimally below it).  This could be done by sending a particle of angular momentum &lt;math&gt;l = 2Me&lt;/math&gt;.  Because this particle has angular momentum, it can only be captured by the black hole if the maximum potential of the black hole is less than &lt;math&gt;(e^2-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving the above effective potential equation for the maximum under the given conditions results in a maximum potential of exactly &lt;math&gt;(e^2-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;!  Testing other values shows that no particle with enough angular momentum to violate the censorship conjecture would be able to enter the black hole, '''because''' they have too much angular momentum to fall in.

==Problems with the concept==
There are a number of difficulties in formalizing the hypothesis:

* There are technical difficulties with properly formalizing the notion of a singularity.
* It is not difficult to construct spacetimes which have naked singularities, but which are not &quot;physically reasonable;&quot; the canonical example of such a spacetime is perhaps the &quot;superextremal&quot; &lt;math&gt;M&lt;|Q|&lt;/math&gt; [[Reissner-Nordstrom]] solution, which contains a singularity at &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; that is not surrounded by a horizon. A formal statement needs some set of hypotheses which exclude these situations.
* [[Caustic (mathematics)|Caustic]]s may occur in simple models of gravitational collapse, and can appear to lead to singularities. These have more to do with the simplified models of bulk matter used, and in any case have nothing to do with general relativity, and need to be excluded.
* Computer models of gravitational collapse have shown that naked singularities can arise, but these models rely on very special circumstances (such as spherical symmetry). These special circumstances need to be excluded by some hypothesis.

In 1991, [[John Preskill]] and [[Kip Thorne]] bet against [[Stephen Hawking]] that the hypothesis was false.  Hawking conceded the bet in 1997, due to the discovery of the special situations just mentioned, which he characterized as &quot;technicalities&quot;. Hawking later reformulated the bet to exclude those technicalities. The revised bet is still open, the prize being &quot;clothing to cover the winner's nakedness&quot;.[http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/new_naked_bet.html]

== Counter-example ==

An exact solution to the scalar-Einstein equations &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}=2\phi_a\phi_b&lt;/math&gt; which forms a counter example to many formulations of the 
cosmic censorship hypothesis was found by Mark D. Roberts in 1985:
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=-(1+2\sigma)dv^2+2dv\,dr+r(r-2\sigma v)\left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \,d\phi^2\right),\quad
\phi = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(1 - \frac{2\sigma v}{r}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

It was first used to describe the Christian Church in the early 2nd century to emphasize its [[universalism|universal scope]]. In the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[ecclesiology]], it has a rich history and several usages. &lt;!-- ↓switched order↑ --&gt;In non-ecclesiastical use, it derives its English meaning directly from its root, and is currently used to mean 
* universal or of general interest; or
* [[liberalism|liberal]], having broad interests, or wide sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[inclusive]], inviting and containing strong evangelism.

The term has been incorporated into the name of the largest Christian communion, the [[Catholic Church]], which consists of 23 churches ''sui iuris'', in [[full communion]] with the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The largest of these, the [[Latin Rite]], consists of nearly 95% of the population of the [[Catholic Church]]. The remaining 5% consist of the 22 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. 

Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] sometimes use the term &quot;'''catholic'''&quot; (with a lower-case letter c) to refer not to the Catholic Church alone, but rather more broadly to the [[Christian Church]] and all believers in [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] across the world and across the ages, regardless of denominational affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, to avoid confusion between this concept and the [[Catholic Church]], above, theologians (in English) will refer to the latter as the Church catholic, utilizing the lower-case. 

The [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s and some [[Methodism|Methodists]] believe that their churches are catholic in the sense that they are in continuity with the original universal church founded by the Apostles. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches all believe that their [[Christian Church|church]] is the only original and universal church. In &quot;Catholic Christendom&quot; (including the Anglican Communion), bishops are considered the highest order of ministers within the Christian religion, as shepherds of unity in communion with the whole church and one another.&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross, ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 1977:175.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicity is considered one of [[Four Marks of the Church]], the others being [[oneness|unity]], [[sanctity]], and [[apostolicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Christliche Religion, Oskar Simmel Rudolf Stählin, 1960, 150&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Nicene Creed]] of 381: &quot;I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&quot;

==History of ecclesiastical use of &quot;catholic&quot;==
===Ignatius of Antioch===
A letter written by [[Ignatius of Antioch]] to Christians in [[Smyrna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Ignatius Epistle to the Smyrnaeans
|author=J. H. Srawley
|accessdate=2007-06-24
|year=1900
|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 106 is the earliest surviving witness to the use of the term ''Catholic Church'' (''[[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]]'', 8). By ''Catholic Church'' Ignatius designated the universal church. Ignatius considered that certain heretics of his time, who disavowed that Jesus was a material being who actually suffered and died, saying instead that &quot;he only seemed to suffer&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 2), were not really Christians.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be Christians&quot;. Ignatius said these heretics did not believe in the reality of Christ's flesh, which did suffer and was raised up again: &quot;They confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 7) and called them &quot;beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 4).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in the ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' in 155 and in the [[Muratorian fragment]], about 177 .

===Cyril of Jerusalem===
[[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 315-386), venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]], urged those he was instructing in the Christian faith: &quot;If ever thou art sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens &quot;houses of the Lord&quot;), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God&quot; (Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theodosius I===
The term ''Catholic Christians'' entered Roman Imperial law when [[Theodosius I]], Emperor from 379 to 395, reserved that name for adherents of &quot;that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the Pontiff (Pope) Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria ...as for the others, since in our judgement they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give their conventicles the name of churches.&quot; This law of 27 February 380 was included in Book 16 of the [[Codex Theodosianus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established Catholic Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire.

===Augustine of Hippo===
The use of the term ''Catholic'' to distinguish the &quot;true&quot; church from heretical groups is found also in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] who wrote:
:&quot;In the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the Apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15-19), down to the present episcopate (in Rome; here Augustine refers to the Petrine succession of the Pope).
:&quot;And so, lastly, does the very name of &quot;Catholic&quot;, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.
:&quot;Such then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.&quot;

===St Vincent of Lerins===
A contemporary of Augustine, [[St. Vincent of Lerins]], wrote in 434 (under the pseudonym Peregrinus) a work known as the ''Commonitoria'' (&quot;Memoranda&quot;). While insisting that, like the human body, church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54-59, chapter XXIII), he stated: &quot;In the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all. For that is truly and in the strictest sense 'catholic,' which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and determinations of all, or at the least of almost all priests and doctors&quot; (section 6, end of chapter II) .

==Western and Eastern Catholics==

The [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and the twenty-two [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] consider that they continue and are charged with preserving the catholic tradition as handed down through the [[Early Church Fathers]]. Eastern Catholic churches are those [[particular church]]es that, in full communion with the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] — the Pope — while remaining autonomous (in Latin, ''sui iuris''), preserve the liturgical, theological and devotional traditions of the various Eastern Christian churches with which they are associated. They include the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian]], [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Greek]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Melkite]], [[Maronite Church|Maronite]], [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Byzantine]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Syro-Malankara]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] and [[Ethiopic Catholic Church|Ethiopic]] Rites. Under [[Pope John Paul II]] the Catholic Church issued a book of beliefs under the title [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], which states: &quot;To believe that the Church is 'holy' and 'catholic,' and that she is 'one' and 'apostolic' (as the Nicene Creed adds), is inseparable from belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P26.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 750]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Catholic Church'' is associated with the whole of the church that is led by the Roman Pontiff, currently [[Pope Benedict XVI]], and whose over one billion adherents are about half of the estimated [[Major religious groups#Largest religions or belief systems by number of adherents|2.1 billion Christians]]. Other Christian churches also lay claim to the description ''catholic'' as a theological quality, including the Eastern Orthodox Church and those churches possessing the historic episcopate (bishops), such as those in the Anglican Communion. Some of them claim to be the one true Catholic Church from which, in their view, other Christians, including those in communion with the Pope, have fallen away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roacusa.org/OrthodoxSchool/TwoThousandYearOldApostolic/Christianity.doc Steven Kovacevich, Apostolic Christianity and the 23,000 Western Churches], especially p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodox.cn/contemporary/20000814basicprinciples/basicprinciples_encn.pdf Basic Principles Of The Attitude of The Russian Orthodox Church toward the Other Christian Confessions, adopted by the Jubilee Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, 14 August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of those who apply the term &quot;catholic church&quot; to all Christians indiscriminately object to this use of the term to designate what they view as only one church within what they see as the &quot;whole&quot; catholic church. However, the church in communion with the Bishop of Rome, both in its Western form and in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], has always considered itself to be the historic Catholic Church, with all others as &quot;non-Catholics&quot; and regularly refers to itself as &quot;the Catholic Church&quot;. This practice is an application of the belief that not all who claim to be Christians are part of the Catholic Church, as Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term &quot;Catholic Church&quot;, considered that certain heretics who called themselves Christians only seemed to be such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm Smyrnaeans, 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though normally distinguishing itself from other churches by calling itself the &quot;Catholic Church&quot;, it also uses the description &quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot;. Even apart from documents drawn up jointly with other churches, it has sometimes, in view of the central position it attributes to the See of Rome, adopted the adjective &quot;Roman&quot; for the whole church, Eastern as well as Western, as in the papal encyclicals [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html ''Divini illius Magistri''] and [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html ''Humani generis''.] Another example is its self-description as the &quot;Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 24 April 1870 Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith of the [[First Vatican Council]]. In all of these documents it also refers to itself both simply as the Catholic Church and by other names. The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], while united with Rome in the faith, have their own traditions and laws, differing from those of the [[Latin Rite]] and those of other Eastern Catholic Churches.

==Divergent usages==
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] also identifies itself as ''Catholic'', as in the title of [http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm ''The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church'']. This church and also [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] all see themselves as the &quot;[[one holy catholic and apostolic Church]]&quot; of the Nicene Creed (in distinction from each other, not collection).

Anglicans and ''Old Catholics'' see themselves as a communion within that one church and Lutherans see themselves as &quot;a reform movement within the greater church catholic&quot;.

Roman Catholics view the Bishop of Rome as the &quot;Successor of Peter&quot; to serve as universal pastor to the entire Church, though certain churches in communion with him are allowed distinct pastoral heads with respect to ordinary administration. Some Anglicans and ''Old Catholics'' accept that the Bishop of Rome is ''primus inter pares'' among all [[primate (religion)|primates]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, but they embrace [[Conciliarism]] as a necessary check on what they consider to be the &quot;excesses&quot; of [[Ultramontanism]].

Recent historic ecumenical efforts on the part of the Catholic Church have focused on healing the rupture between the Western (&quot;Catholic&quot;) and the Eastern (&quot;Orthodox&quot;) churches. [[Pope John Paul II]] often spoke of his great desire that the ''Catholic Church'' &quot;once again breathe with both lungs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html Encyciclical ''Ut unum sint''], 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_sacri-canones_lt.html Apostolic Constitution ''Sacri Canones'']&lt;/ref&gt; thus emphasizing that the Roman Catholic Church seeks to restore full communion with the separated Eastern churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism Obituary of Pope John Paul II]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[East-West Schism]], conventionally dated to 1054, a brief reunification was agreed to between the Pope and a number of Eastern Orthodox bishops at the [[Council of Florence]]. However, this agreement was denied by one of the EO bishops present, namely Mark of Ephesus, and the common folk of the EOC generally rejected said agreement as well. The present pope, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], has stated his wish to restore full unity with the Orthodox. The Roman Catholic Church considers that almost all of the ancient theological differences have been satisfactorily addressed (the [[Filioque]] clause, the nature of [[purgatory]], etc.), and has declared that differences in traditional customs, observances and discipline are no obstacle to unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html Second Vatican Council Decree on Ecumenism], 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Western Christians===
* Most [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and post-Reformation churches use the term ''catholic'' (often with a lower-case ''c'') to refer to the belief that all Christians are part of one church regardless of denominational divisions; e.g., Chapter XXV of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] refers to the ''catholic or universal Church''. It is in line with this interpretation, which applies the word ''catholic'' (universal) to no one denomination, that they understand the phrase &quot;One [[Holy]] catholic and [[Apostolic succession|Apostolic]] [[Christian Church|Church]]&quot; in the [[Nicene Creed]], the phrase ''the Catholic faith'' in the [[Athanasian Creed]] and the phrase ''holy catholic church'' in the [[Apostles' Creed]].

* The term used also to mean those Christian churches which maintain that their [[Historical episcopate|episcopate]] can be [[Apostolic Succession|traced unbrokenly back]] to the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and consider themselves part of a ''catholic'' (universal) body of believers. Among those who regard themselves as ''catholic'' (lower-case &quot;c&quot;), but not ''Roman Catholic'' (upper-case &quot;c&quot;), are [[Anglican]]s and some smaller [[Breakaway Catholic Churches]] such as the [[Polish National Catholic Church]], [[Independent Catholic]]s, [[Ancient Catholic]]s and the [[Liberal Catholic Church]]es, as well [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] (though the latter often prefer the lower-case &quot;c&quot; and stress that they are both Protestant and catholic). Some 19th and 20th century churches like the [[Old Catholic Church]]es and [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s (who may or may not be in communion with Rome) consider themselves to be catholic and also &quot;true&quot; Roman Catholics.

* The term can refer to the one (singular number) church that, according to {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18-19}}, [[Jesus]] told the [[Apostle Peter]] he would build: &quot;And I tell you, you are כיפא (''Kepha'') ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for &quot;rock&quot;), and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;

* Some use the term ''catholic'' to distinguish their own position from a [[Calvinist]] or [[Puritan]] form of Reformed-[[Protestantism]]. These include a faction of Anglicans often also called [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], 19th century [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutherans]], 20th century [[High Church Lutheran]]s or [[evangelical-Catholic]]s and others.

[[Methodist]]s and [[Presbyterian]]s believe their denominations owe their origins to the Apostles and the early church, but do not claim descent from ancient church structures such as the episcopate. However, both of these churches hold that they are a part of the catholic (universal) church. According to ''[[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'': {{quote|The various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no [[intercommunion]]...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers.

[[Image:CrystalEastman.jpeg|thumb|250px|Crystal Eastman, feminist and political activist.|]]
'''Crystal Catherine Eastman''' (June 25, 1881 – July 8, 1928) was a [[lawyer]], [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[journalist]]. She is best remembered as a leader in the fight for [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's right to vote]], as a co-editor of the radical arts and politics magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]],'' and as a co-founder of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Crystal Eastman was born in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on June 25, 1881, and her parents, Samuel Elijah Eastman and Annis Bertha Ford, were both [[Congregational Church]] clergy, and together served as pastors at the church of [[Thomas K. Beecher]] near [[Elmira, New York]]. In 1889, her mother had become one of the first women ordained as a [[Protestant]] minister in America.  This part of [[New York State|New York]] was in the so-called &quot;Burnt Over District,&quot; which earlier in the 19th century had generated much religious excitement, including the formation of the [[Mormon]] movement, and social causes, such as [[abolitionism]] and support for the [[Underground Railroad]].  Her parents were friendly with the writer [[Mark Twain]], and from this association young Crystal herself became acquainted with Twain.

Crystal graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1903 and received an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in [[sociology]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1904. Receiving her law degree from [[New York University Law School]], she graduated second in the class of 1907.  She was the sister of the [[socialism|socialist]] activist [[Max Eastman]], with whom she was quite close throughout her life.

===Social efforts===
Social work pioneer and journal editor [[Paul Kellogg]] offered Eastman her first job, investigating labor conditions for [[The Pittsburgh Survey]] sponsored by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]]. Her report, ''Work Accidents and the Law'' (1910), became a classic and resulted in the first [[workers' compensation]] law, which she drafted while serving on a New York state commission. She continued to campaign for occupational safety and health while working as an investigating attorney for the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency. She was at one time called the &quot;most dangerous woman in America,&quot; due to her [[free-love]] idealism and outspoken nature.

===Emancipation===
During a brief marriage to Wallace J. Benedict which ended in divorce, Eastman lived in [[Milwaukee]] and managed the unsuccessful 1912 [[Wisconsin]] [[suffrage]] battle. When she returned east in 1913 she joined [[Alice Paul]], [[Lucy Burns]], and others in founding the militant [[Congressional Union]], which became the [[National Woman's Party]]. After the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] gave women the vote in 1920, Eastman and three others wrote the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first introduced in 1923. One of the few socialists to endorse the ERA, she warned that protective legislation for women would mean only discrimination against women. Eastman claimed that one could assess the importance of the ERA by the intensity of the opposition to it, but she felt that it was still a struggle worth fighting.

===Peace efforts===
[[File:Eastman-Crystal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Crystal Eastman was a noted anti-militarist, who helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.]]
During [[World War I]], Eastman was one of the founders of the [[Woman's Peace Party]] and was president of the [[New York City|New York]] branch. Renamed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] in 1921, it remains the oldest extant women's peace organization. Eastman also became executive director of the [[American Union Against Militarism]], which lobbied against America's entrance into the European war and more successfully against war with Mexico in 1916, sought to remove profiteering from arms manufacturing, and campaigned against [[conscription]] and imperial adventures. When the United States entered World War I, Eastman organized with [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]] and [[Norman Thomas]] the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] to protect [[conscientious objectors]], or in her words: ''To maintain something over here that will be worth coming back to when the weary war is over.'' The NCLB grew into the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], with Baldwin at the head and Eastman functioning as attorney in charge. Eastman is credited as a founding member of the ACLU, but her role as founder of the NCLB may have been largely ignored by posterity due to her personal differences with Baldwin.

In 1916 Eastman married British editor and antiwar activist Walter Fuller with whom she had two children, [[Jeffrey Fuller|Jeffrey]] and Annis, and worked with him until the end of the war, when he returned to [[England]] to find work.

===Post-War===
After the war, Eastman organized the [[First Feminist Congress]] in 1919, she co-owned and edited a radical journal of politics, art, and literature, [[The Liberator (United States magazine)|''The Liberator'']], with her brother [[Max Eastman|Max]] and she [[commuting|commuted]] between [[London]], to be with her husband, and New York, where she was blacklisted and thus rendered unemployable during the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919-1920. During the 1920s her only paid work was as a columnist for feminist journals, notably ''[[Equal Rights (journal)|Equal Rights]]'' and ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''. Eastman claimed that &quot;''life was a big battle for the complete feminist,''&quot; but she was convinced that the complete feminist would someday achieve total victory.

===Death and legacy===
Crystal Eastman died on July 8, 1928.

Eastman has been called one of the United States' most neglected leaders, because, although she wrote pioneering legislation and created long-lasting political organizations, she disappeared from history for fifty years. In 2000 she was inducted in the (American) [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].

Eastman's papers are housed at [[Harvard University]].

'''Christopher Wolfgang Alexander''' (born October 4, 1936 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) is a registered architect noted for his theories about design, and for more than 200 building projects in [[California]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]] and around the world. Reasoning that users know more about the buildings they need than any architect could, he produced and validated (in collaboration with Sarah Ishikawa and [[Murray Silverstein]]) a &quot;[[pattern language]]&quot; designed to empower anyone to design and build at any scale. Alexander is often overlooked by texts in the history and theory of Architecture because his work intentionally disregarded contemporary Architecture discourse, appealing more through methods consistent with his theories than through established practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;nikos&quot;&gt;Nikos Salingaros, &quot;[[A Theory of Architecture]]&quot;, Umbau-Verlag, Solingen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Alexander is widely considered to occupy a place outside the discipline, the discourse, and the practice of Architecture. In 1958 he moved from England to the [[United States]], living and teaching in [[Berkeley, California]] from 1963. He is [[Professors in the United States#Professor emeritus and emerita|professor emeritus]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Now retired (though ceaselessly active), he is based in Arundel, Sussex, UK.

==Education==
Alexander grew up in England and started his education in sciences. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Architecture and a [[Master's degree]] in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Architecture ever awarded at [[Harvard University]]), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked at MIT in transportation theory and in computer science, and worked at Harvard in cognition and cognitive studies.

==Honors==
Alexander was awarded the First Gold Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects in 1972. He was awarded the Seaside Prize in 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he was one of the two inaugural recipients of the Athena Award, given by the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU). On 5 November 2009, at a ceremony in Washington D.C., he was awarded (''in absentia'') the [[Vincent Scully Prize]] by the [[National Building Museum]].

==Career==
===Writings===

''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:

{{quote|There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.}}

''[[A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]'' (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a [[generative grammar]].

The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.

The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.

The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily-stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete. It uses [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] construction to build as high as three stories, permitting very high densities.

This book's method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in ''The [[Oregon Experiment]]'' (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.

''A New Theory of Urban Design'' (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in [[urbanism]] among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students, it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only ''local'' rules, in relation to neighbours. A vastly undervalued part of the Alexander canon, ''A New Theory'' is important in understanding the generative processes which give rise to the [[shanty town]]s latterly championed by [[Stewart Brand]],&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 2 of his ''Whole Earth Discipline'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Neuwirth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Shadow Cities: a billion squatters, a new urban world'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Hanson &amp; Samir Younés, “Reuniting Urban Form and Urban Process: The Prince of Wales’s Urban Design Task Force”, ''Journal of Urban Design'', v.6, no.2 (June 2001), pp.185-209; Charles, Prince of Wales, speech at the &quot;Traditional Urbanism in Contemporary Practice&quot; conference at The Prince‘s Foundation, London, 20th November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]]'' (2003-4), which includes The ''Phenomenon of Life'', ''The Process of Creating Life'', ''A Vision of a Living World'' and ''The Luminous Ground'', is Alexander's latest, and most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in which we view the world in general. The mostly static patterns from ''A Pattern Language'' have been amended by [[sequence theory|more dynamic sequences]], which describe how to work towards patterns (which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences). [[sequence theory|Sequences]], like [[pattern language|patterns]], promise to be tools of wider scope than building (just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture).

The online publication [http://www.katarxis3.com/index.html &quot;Katarxis 3&quot;] (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary [http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm debate] between Alexander and [[Peter Eisenman]] from 1982.

===Buildings===
Among Alexander's most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near [[Tokyo]] (the building process of which is soon to be outlined in his forthcoming book ''Battle''); the West Dean Visitors Centre &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.livingneighborhoods.org/ht-0/westdean.htm England, The West Dean Visitors Centre]'' - Project History&lt;/ref&gt; in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in [[San Jose, California]] (both described in ''Nature of Order''); the Martinez House (an experimental house in Martinez, California made of lightweight concrete); the low-cost housing in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]] (described in ''The Production of Houses''); and several private houses (described and illustrated in &quot;The Nature of Order&quot;). Alexander's built work is characterized by a special quality (which he calls &quot;the quality without a name&quot;) that relates to human beings and induces feelings of belonging to the place and structure. This quality is found in the most loved traditional and historic buildings and urban spaces, and is precisely what Alexander has tried to capture with his sophisticated mathematical design theories. Paradoxically, achieving this connective human quality has also moved his buildings away from the abstract imageability valued in contemporary architecture, and this is one reason why his buildings are under-appreciated at present.&lt;ref name=&quot;nikos&quot; /&gt;

[[Michael Mehaffy]] wrote an [http://www.katarxis3.com/Gallery.htm introductory essay] on Christopher Alexander's built work in the online publication [http://www.katarxis3.com/index.html &quot;Katarxis 3&quot;] , which includes a [http://www.katarxis3.com/Gallery/nav.htm gallery] of Alexander's major built projects to date (September 2004).

==== Teaching ====
Apart from his lengthy teaching career at Berkeley (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key member of faculty both of The Prince of Wales's Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990–1994) and [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment|The Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hanson &amp; Younés, ''op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
===Computer Science===

Alexander's ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'' was required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s. It had an influence&lt;ref name=&quot;naur&quot;&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.553&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf H. Kilov - Using RM-ODP to bridge communication gaps between stakeholders, Communications H Kilov -  Workshop on ODP for Enterprise Computing 2004] &quot;Peter Naur proposed in 1968 to use Christopher Alexander's work...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and 1970s on [[programming language design]], modular programming, [[object-oriented programming]], [[software engineering]] and other design methodologies. Alexander's mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s influential ''A Discipline of Programming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| date = 1976-10-28

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Pattern Language]]''‘s greatest influence in computer science is the [[design patterns]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Chris.text.html#COMPUTER Christopher's Alexander's influence on Computer Science]&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander's philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design also influenced the [[extreme programming]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;accu&quot;&gt;[http://accu.org/index.php/journals/509 Association of C and C++ Users: Interview with Kent Beck on eXtreme Programming]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wiki]] was invented&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki C2 Wiki Front Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns C2 Wiki: People, Projects and Patterns]&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the Hillside Group to work on programming [[design patterns]]. More recently, [[The Nature of Order]]'s &quot;deep geometrical structures&quot; have been cited as having importance for object-oriented programming, particularly in C++.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/budha/coplien.htm Space: the Final Frontier]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] wrote that Alexander's work was influential in the origin of ''[[The Sims]]'' computer game, and in his later game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iconeye.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3068:will-wright-interview Will Wright interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The fourth volume of ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' approaches religious questions from a scientific rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter, [[human perception]] of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts, {{vague|date=December 2010}}{{Examples|date=December 2010}} and he suggests a crucial link between traditional [[belief]]s and recent scientific advances.{{vague|date=December 2010}}{{Examples|date=December 2010}} Despite his leanings toward [[Deism]],{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Alexander has retained a respect for the [[Catholic church]], believing it to embody a great deal of accumulated human truth within its rituals.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clabbers''' is a game played by tournament [[Scrabble]] players for fun, or occasionally at Scrabble variant tournaments.  The name derives from the fact that the words CLABBERS and SCRABBLE form an [[anagram]] pair.

==Rules==
The rules are identical to that of Scrabble, except that valid plays are only required to form anagrams of acceptable words; in other words, the letters in a word do not need to be placed in the correct order. If a word is challenged, the player who played the word must then name an acceptable word that anagrams to the tiles played.

Because the number of &quot;words&quot; that can be formed is vastly larger than in [[standard English]], the board usually ends up tightly packed in places, and necessarily quite empty in others. Game scores will often be much higher than in standard Scrabble, due to the relative ease of making high-scoring overlap plays and easier access to premium squares.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the fantasy hero|other uses|Corum (disambiguation)}}

'''Corum Jhaelen Irsei''' is the name of a fantasy hero in a series of books written by [[Michael Moorcock]].  Corum is an aspect of Moorcock's [[Eternal Champion]] and is therefore related to some of his other characters, such as [[Elric of Melniboné]] and [[Hawkmoon|Dorian Hawkmoon]].  His books also draw heavily on ancient Celtic mythology, especially the second trilogy as well as similarities to Norse mythology, Corum's loss of both a hand and an eye evoking associations with the gods [[Odin]] and [[Tyr]].  Corum himself is the last of an ancient race called the [[Vadhagh]], who are slaughtered by the new race of Mabden (humans).  He was a prince of his people - Corum Jhaelen Irsei, the Prince in the Scarlet Robe. The name Corum Jhaelen Irsei is also an anagram of Jeremiah (Jerry) Cornelius, another of Michael Moorcock's characters in the Eternal Champion cycle.

== Corum novels ==
Corum is the protagonist of the following Moorcock novels:

* ''The Knight of the Swords'' (1971)
* ''The Queen of the Swords'' (1971)
* ''The King of the Swords'' (1971)
* ''The Bull and the Spear'' (1973)
* ''The Oak and the Ram'' (1973)
* ''The Sword and the Stallion'' (1974)

The first three novels have been published in the UK under the omnibus title ''Corum'', and the second three under the omnibus title ''The Prince with the Silver Hand''. In the US, the omnibus titles are ''[[The Swords Trilogy]]'' and ''The Chronicles of Corum'', respectively.

The second Corum series (''The Bull and the Spear'', ''The Oak and the Ram'', ''The Sword and the Stallion'') are very much a fictionalized - and coherent - retelling of some stories from [[Irish mythology]]. Specifically Corum is a stand-in for [[Nuada]] (usually called Nuada of the Silver Hand), his adventures are related to the mythical history of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and [[Balor|Balor of the Evil Eye]].

== Other appearances ==
=== Novels ===
Corum also appears in other books of the Eternal Champion cycle: ''The Vanishing Tower'' and ''The Sailor on the Seas of Fate'' with Elric, and ''The Quest for Tanelorn'' with Hawkmoon. He also has an entry in [[Wayne Barlowe]]'s ''[[Barlowe's Guide to Fantasy]]''.

=== Comics ===
The character has appeared in comics a number of times. In 1987, [[First Comics]] published ''The Chronicles of Corum'', which ran for twelve issues (the first six of which were illustrated by [[Mike Mignola]]) and adapted by [[Mike Baron]] and [[Mark Shainblum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=8054|title=''The Chronicles of Corum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; First followed this in 1988 with the four issue ''Corum: The Bull and the Spear'' adapted by [[Mark Shainblum]] and illustrated by [[Jill Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=7884|title=''Corum: The Bull and the Spear''}}&lt;/ref&gt; These together adapted the first four books in the Corum series.

=== Games ===
In 2001 [[Darcsyde Productions]] produced a supplement for use with [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' (aka ''Elric!'') [[role-playing game]] adapting the Corum settings and characters for role-playing.

=== Music ===
*The Italian metal band [[Domine]] features Corum in their song ''Prince in the Scarlet Robe'' on their ''Emperor of the Black Runes'' album. They also feature many songs dealing with [[Michael Moorcock]]'s [[Elric]] and Moorcock himself is also specifically thanked and noted as an influence in the liner notes for each of their albums.
*The German metal band [[Blind Guardian]] makes brief reference to Corum in their song &quot;Damned for All Time&quot; on their ''[[Follow the Blind]]'' album and also in the track &quot;[[Imaginations from the Other Side]]&quot; from the album of the same name.
*The Edu-Core band [[Bloodhag]] mention Corum in the first line of their song &quot;Michael Moorcock,&quot; a song about the author.
*The American metal band [[Skelator]] wrote an epic about Corum's tragic tale named &quot;The Coming of Chaos&quot; on their &quot;Swords&quot; EP.
*The French black metal band [[Fhoi Myore]] uses the Corum novels as main inspiration.

      <comment>/* New instructions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''complex instruction set computer''' ('''CISC''') ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|k}}), is a [[computer]] where single  [[instruction set architecture|instruction]]s can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from [[Memory (computers)|memory]], an [[arithmetic]] [[operator (programming)|operation]], and a [[memory (computers)|memory store]]) and/or are capable of multi-step operations or [[addressing mode]]s within single instructions. The term was retroactively coined in contrast to [[reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC).

Examples of CISC instruction set architectures are [[System/360]] through [[z/Architecture]], [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68k]], and [[x86]].

==Historical design context==
===Incitements and benefits===
Before the [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] philosophy became prominent, many [[computer Architecture|computer architects]] tried to bridge the so called [[semantic gap]], i.e. to design instruction sets that directly supported high-level programming constructs such as procedure calls, loop control, and complex [[addressing mode]]s, allowing data structure and array accesses to be combined into single instructions. Instructions are also typically highly encoded in order to further enhance the code density. The compact nature of such instruction sets results in smaller [[Computer program|program]] sizes and fewer (slow) main memory accesses, which at the time (early 1960s and onwards) resulted in a tremendous savings on the cost of computer memory and disc storage, as well as faster execution. It also meant good programming productivity even in [[assembly language]], as [[high level language]]s such as [[Fortran]] or [[ALGOL|Algol]] were not always available or appropriate (microprocessors in this category are sometimes still programmed in assembly language for certain types of critical applications).

====New instructions====
In the '70s, analysis of high level languages indicated some complex machine language implementations and it was determined that new instructions could improve performance. Some instructions were added that were never intended to be used in assembly language but fit well with compiled high level languages. Compilers were updated to take advantage of these instructions. The benefits of semantically rich instructions with compact encodings can be seen in modern processors as well, particularly in the high performance segment where caches are a central component (as opposed to most [[embedded system]]s). This is because these fast, but complex and expensive, memories are inherently limited in size, making compact code beneficial. Of course, the fundamental reason they are needed is that main memories (i.e. [[dynamic RAM]] today) remain slow compared to a (high performance) CPU-core.

===Design issues===
While many designs achieved the aim of higher throughput at lower cost and also allowed high-level language constructs to be expressed by fewer instructions, it was observed that this was not ''always'' the case. For instance, low-end versions of complex architectures (i.e. using less hardware) could lead to situations where it was possible to improve performance by ''not'' using a complex instruction (such as a procedure call or enter instruction), but instead using a sequence of simpler instructions.

One reason for this was that architects (microcode writers) sometimes &quot;over-designed&quot; assembler language instructions, i.e. including features which were not possible to implement efficiently on the basic hardware available. This could, for instance, be &quot;side effects&quot; (above conventional flags), such as the setting of a register or memory location that was perhaps seldom used; if this was done via ordinary (non duplicated) internal buses, or even the ''external'' bus, it would demand extra cycles every time, and thus be quite inefficient.

Even in balanced high performance designs, highly encoded and (relatively) high-level instructions could be complicated to decode and execute efficiently within a limited transistor budget. Such architectures therefore required a great deal of work on the part of the processor designer in cases where a simpler, but (typically) slower, solution based on decode tables and/or microcode sequencing is not appropriate. At the time where transistors and other components were a limited resource, this also left fewer components and less area for other types of performance optimizations. 

====The RISC idea====
The circuitry that performs the actions defined by the microcode in many (but not all) CISC processors is, in itself, a processor which in many ways is reminiscent in structure to very early CPU designs. In the early 1970s, this gave rise to ideas to return to simpler processor designs in order to make it more feasible to cope without (''then'' relatively large and expensive) ROM tables and/or PLA structures for sequencing and/or decoding. However, the first (retroactively) RISC-''labeled'' processor ([[IBM 801]] - [[IBM]]s Watson Research Center, mid-1970s) was a tightly pipelined simple machine originally intended to be used as an internal microcode kernel, or engine, in CISC designs. Simplicity and regularity also in the visible instruction set would make it easier to implement overlapping processor stages ([[Pipeline (computing)|pipelining]]) at the machine code level (i.e. the level seen by compilers.) However, pipelining at that level was already used in some high performance CISC computers (&quot;supercomputers&quot;) in order to reduce the instruction cycle time, despite the complications of implementing within the limited component count and wiring complexity feasible at the time. Internal microcode execution, on the other hand, could be more or less pipelined depending on the particular design.

====Superscalar====
In a more modern context, the complex variable length encoding used by some of the typical CISC architectures makes it complicated, but still feasible, to build a superscalar implementation of a CISC programming model ''directly''; the in-order superscalar [[Intel P5|Original Pentium]] and the out-of-order superscalar [[Cyrix 6x86]] are well known examples of this. The frequent memory accesses for operands of a typical CISC machine may limit the instruction level parallelism that can be extracted from the code, although this is strongly mediated by the fast cache structures used in modern designs, as well as by other measures. Due to inherently compact and semantically rich instructions, the average amount of work performed per machine code unit (i.e. per byte or bit) is higher for a CISC than a RISC processor, which may give it a significant advantage in a modern cache based implementation. (Whether the downsides versus the upsides justifies a complex design or not is food for a never-ending debate in certain circles.)

Transistors for logic, PLAs, and microcode are no longer scarce resources; only large high-speed cache memories are limited by the maximum number of transistors today. Although complex, the transistor count of CISC decoders do not grow exponentially like the total number of transistors per processor (the majority typically used for caches). Together with better tools and enhanced technologies, this has led to new implementations of highly encoded and variable length designs without load-store limitations (i.e. non-RISC). This governs re-implementations of older architectures such as the ubiquitous x86 (see below) as well as new designs for [[microcontroller]]s for [[embedded system]]s, and similar uses. The superscalar complexity in the case of modern x86 was solved with dynamically issued and buffered micro-operations, i.e. indirect and dynamic superscalar execution; the [[Pentium Pro]] and [[AMD K5]] are early examples of this. This allows a fairly simple superscalar design to be located after the (fairly complex) decoders (and buffers), giving, so to speak, the best of both worlds in many respects.

====CISC and RISC terms====
The terms CISC and RISC have become less meaningful with the continued evolution of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations. The first highly (or tightly) pipelined x86 implementations, the 486 designs from [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Cyrix]], and [[IBM]], supported every instruction that their predecessors did, but achieved ''maximum efficiency'' only on a fairly simple x86 subset that was only a little more than a typical RISC instruction set (i.e. without typical RISC ''[[load-store architecture|load-store]]'' limitations). The Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] generation was a [[superscalar]] version of these principles. However, modern x86 processors also (typically) decode and split instructions into dynamic sequences of internally-buffered [[micro-operations]], which not only helps execute a larger subset of instructions in a pipelined (overlapping) fashion, but also facilitates more advanced extraction of parallelism out of the code stream, for even higher performance.

The [[order (biology)|order]] '''Cetacea''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|ɨ|ˈ|t|eɪ|ʃ|ⁱ|ə}}; L. '''''cetus'''''; whale, from Greek) includes the marine mammals commonly known as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s. ''Cetus'' is [[Latin]] and is used in biological names to mean &quot;whale&quot;; its original meaning, &quot;large sea animal&quot;, was more general. It comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{Polytonic|κῆτος}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|kētos}}''), meaning &quot;whale&quot; or &quot;any huge [[fish]] or [[sea monster]]&quot;. In [[Greek mythology]] the monster [[Perseus]] defeated was called [[Ceto]], which is depicted by the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus]]. [[Cetology]] is the branch of marine science associated with the study of cetaceans.

'''Cetaceans''' are the [[mammal]]s best [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic life]]. Their body is fusiform (spindle-shaped). The forelimbs are modified into flippers. The tiny hindlimbs are [[vestigial]]; they do not attach to the backbone and are hidden within the body. The tail has horizontal [[wikt:Special:Search/fluke|fluke]]s. Cetaceans are nearly hairless, and are insulated from the cooler water they inhabit by a thick layer of [[blubber]]. Some species are noted for their [[cetacean intelligence|high intelligence]].

==Respiration==
[[Image:DelfinEstrecho.jpg|thumb|left|A [[dolphin]] in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]|alt=Overhead photo of whale at surface]]

Cetaceans breathe air. They surface periodically to exhale [[carbon dioxide]] and inhale a fresh supply of [[oxygen]]. During diving, a muscular action closes the [[blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] ([[nostril]]s), which remain closed until the cetacean next breaks the surface; when it surfaces, the muscles open the blowholes and warm air is exhaled.

Cetaceans' blowholes [[Evolution of cetaceans|have evolved]] to a position at the top of the head, simplifying breathing in sometimes rough seas. When the stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'blow' or 'spout' and varies by species in terms of shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.

Cetaceans can remain under water for much longer periods than most other mammals, (approximately 7–30 minutes, varying by species) due to large physiological differences. Two studied advantages of cetacean physiology let this order (and other marine mammals) forage underwater for extended periods without breathing:

* Mammalian [[myoglobin]] concentrations in [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[muscle]] have much variation. [[New Zealand]] white rabbits have {{convert|0.08|g|oz}} +/- {{convert|0.6|g|oz}} myoglobin in {{convert|100|g|oz}} of wet muscle,&lt;ref&gt;
Castellini and Somero, 1981{{Citation broken|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a [[northern bottlenose whale]] has {{convert|6.34|g|oz}}.&lt;ref&gt;
Scholander, 1940{{Citation broken|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myoglobin, by nature, has a higher oxygen affinity than [[hemoglobin]]. The higher the myoglobin concentration in skeletal muscle, the longer the animal can stay underwater.

* Increased body size also increases maximum dive duration. Greater body size implies increased muscle mass and increased oxygen stores. Cetaceans also obey [[Kleiber's law]], which states that mass and metabolic rate are inversely related. I.e., larger animals consume less oxygen than smaller animals per unit mass.

==Vision, hearing and echolocation==
Cetacean [[eyes]] are set on the side rather than the front of the head. This means that only cetaceans with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good binocular vision forward and downward. Tear glands secrete greasy tears, which protect the eyes from the salt in the water. The lens is almost spherical, which is most efficient at focusing the minimal light that reaches deep water. Cetaceans make up for their generally poor vision (with the exception of the dolphin) with excellent hearing.

As with the eyes, cetacean [[ears]] are also small. Life in the sea accounts for the cetacean's loss of its external ears, whose function is to collect and focus airborne sound waves. However, water conducts sound better than air, so the external ear is unneeded: it is a tiny hole in the skin, just behind the eye. The highly developed inner ear can detect sounds from dozens of miles away and discern from which direction the sound comes.

[[Odontoceti]] are generally capable of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name=emm&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this, Odontoceti can discern the size, shape, surface characteristics, distance and movement of an object. With this ability cetaceans can search for, chase and catch fast-swimming prey in total darkness. Echolocation is so advanced in most Odontoceti that they can distinguish between prey and non-prey (such as humans or boats); captive Odontoceti can be trained to distinguish between, for example, balls of different sizes or shapes.  [[Mysticeti]] have little need of echolocation, because they prey upon tiny fish such as [[krill]] that are impractical to locate with echolocation.

Cetaceans also use sound to [[communication|communicate]], whether it be groans, moans, whistles, clicks or the complex 'singing' of the [[humpback whale]].

==Feeding==
&lt;!--[[Image:Cetacea.jpg|thumb|right|Various Cetacea: 1- [[bowhead whale]]; 2- [[orca]]; 3- [[right whale]]; 4- [[sperm whale]]; 5- [[narwhal]]; 6- [[blue whale]]; 7- [[rorqual]]; 8- [[beluga (whale)|beluga]] ]] Commenting out for now... Which right whale species? There are three. Which rorqual species? There are nine, including the blue whale.--&gt;
The toothed whales such as the sperm whale, [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]], dolphins and porpoises, have teeth that they use for catching [[fish]], [[squid]] or other marine life. They do not chew but swallow prey whole. When they catch large prey, such as when the [[orca]] (''Orcinus orca'') catches a [[pinniped|seal]], they bite off and swallow one chunk at a time.

Mysticeti instead have [[baleen]] plates made of [[keratin]] (the same substance as human fingernails) which hang from the upper jaw. These plates filter small animals (such as [[krill]] and fish) from the seawater. Cetaceans included in this group include the Blue, Humpback, Bowhead and Minke whales.

Not all Mysticeti feed on plankton: the larger species eat small shoaling fish, such as [[herring]] and [[sardine]], called micronecton. The [[gray whale]] (''Eschrichtius robustus''), is a [[Benthos|benthic]] feeder, primarily eating sea floor [[crustacean]]s.

==Mammalian nature==
Cetaceans are mammals, that is, members of the [[Class (biology)|class]] Mammalia. The closest living relatives of cetaceans are the [[even-toed ungulate]]s, such as the hippopotamus and deer.&lt;ref name=science_news_1&gt;{{

Mammalian characteristics include [[warm-blooded]]ness, breathing air through their [[lungs]], and [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] their young, and growing [[hair]], although very little of it.

Another way of distinguishing a cetacean from a fish is by the shape of the tail. Fish tails are vertical and move from side to side when the fish swims. Cetacea tails&amp;mdash;called a fluke&amp;mdash;are horizontal and move up and down, because cetacea spines bend in the same manner as a human spine.

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Cetaceans.svg|right|thumb|Size comparison of nearly all known extant cetacean species. Note the human diver at lower right for scale.]]

The order Cetacea contains about ninety species, all marine except for four species of [[river dolphin|freshwater dolphins]]. The order contains two suborders,  [[Mysticeti]]  (baleen whales) and [[Odontoceti]]  (toothed whales, which includes dolphins and porpoises). The species  range in size from [[Commerson's dolphin]], smaller than a human, to the [[Blue Whale]],  the largest animal ever known to have lived.

===Mysticeti vs Odontoceti===
Fossils indicate that before evolving baleen, Mysticeti also had teeth, so defining the Odontoceti via teeth alone is problematic, and paleontologists have instead identified other features uniting fossil and modern odontocetes that are not shared by Mysticetes.

===Classification===
{{See also|List of cetaceans|List of extinct cetaceans}}
The classification here closely follows [[Dale W. Rice]], ''Marine Mammals of the World: Systematics and Distribution'' (1998), which has become the standard taxonomy reference in the field. There is very close agreement between this classification and that of ''Mammal Species of the World: 3rd Edition'' (Wilson and Reeder eds., 2005). Any differences are noted using the abbreviations &quot;Rice&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal: Rice cetacea classification}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;MSW3&quot;&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt; respectively. Further differences due to recent discoveries are also noted.

Discussion of synonyms and subspecies are relegated to the relevant genus and species articles.

[[Image:Canterbury Tales.png|thumb|350px|A [[woodcut]] from [[William Caxton|William Caxton's]] second edition of the Canterbury Tales printed in 1483.]]
'''''  The Canterbury Tales ''''' is a collection of stories written in [[Middle English]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] at the end of the 14th century. The tales (mostly in verse, although some are in prose) are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from [[Southwark]] to the shrine of [[Saint Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. In a long list of works, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' was Chaucer's [[magnum opus]]. He uses the tales and the descriptions of the characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Structurally, the collection bears the influence of ''[[The Decameron]]'', which [[Chaucer]] is said to have come across during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372. However, Chaucer peoples his tales with 'sondry folk' rather than Boccaccio's fleeing nobles.

==Text==
The question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is finished has not yet been answered. The combined elements of Chaucer's quadri-lingual expertise in law, philosophy, and other subjects, the uncertainty of medieval English historical records, issues of manuscript transmission, and Chaucer's method of telling his stories through a multi-perspective prism of subjectivity make the &quot;Tales&quot; extremely difficult to interpret. There are 83 known manuscripts of the work from the late medieval and early Renaissance period, more than any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the tales' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearsall, 8&quot;&gt;Pearsall, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been complete at one time, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 6—7&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while others suggest that Chaucer added to and revised his work as it was being copied and (possibly) distributed. No official, unarguably complete version of the ''Tales'' exists and no consensus has been reached regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.&lt;ref name = seven&gt;Cooper, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Textual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular methods of ordering the tales. The standard scholarly edition divides the ''Tales'' into ten &quot;fragments.&quot; The tales that comprise a fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. Between fragments, however, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible tales orders, the most popular of which is as follows:&lt;ref name = seven/&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;
!  width=&quot;20%&quot; | Fragment
!  width=&quot;30%&quot; | Tales
|-
| Fragment I(A)
| [[General Prologue]],  [[The Knight's Tale|Knight]], [[The Miller's Tale|Miller]], [[The Reeve's Tale|Reeve]], [[The Cook's Tale|Cook]]

| [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]], [[The Friar's Tale|Friar]], [[The Summoner's Tale|Summoner]]

|-
| Fragment IX(H)
| [[The Manciple's Tale|Manciple]]
|-
| Fragment X(I)
| [[The Parson's Tale|Parson]]
|}

An alternative ordering (seen in early manuscript [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI. However, the order indicated above follows that of some other early manuscripts. Fragments I and II almost always follow each other, as do VI and VII, IX and X in the oldest manuscripts. Fragments IV and V, by contrast are located in varying locations from manuscript to manuscript. Victorians would frequently move Fragment VII(B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to follow Fragment II(B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), but this trend is no longer followed and has no justification.&lt;ref name = seven/&gt; Even the earliest surviving manuscripts are not Chaucer's originals, the oldest being MS Peniarth 392 D (called &quot;[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]&quot;), compiled by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. The scribe uses the order shown above, though he does not seem to have had a full collection of Chaucer's tales, so part are missing. The most beautiful of the manuscripts of the tales is the [[Ellesmere manuscript]], and many editors have followed the order of the Ellesmere over the centuries, even down to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 10, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8&lt;/ref&gt; The latest of the manuscripts is [[William Caxton|William Caxton's]] 1478 print edition, the first version of the tales to be published in print. Since this version was created from a now-lost manuscript, it is counted as among the 83 manuscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearsall, 8&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!-- The exception to the independence between fragments are the last two. The Manciple's tale is the last tale in IX but fragment X starts with the Parson's prologue by saying that the Manciple had finished his tale. The reason that they are kept as two different fragments is that the Manciple starts his short tale in the morning but the Parson's tale is told at four in the afternoon. It is assumed that Chaucer would have amended his manuscript or inserted more tales to fill the time.{{cn|date=November 2010}} can't find citation for this. will add back if I can....--&gt;

==Language==
''The Canterbury Tales'' was written in [[Middle English]], specifically in a dialect associated with [[London]] and spellings associated with the then emergent [[Middle English#Chancery Standard|chancery standard]]. Although no manuscript exists in Chaucer's own hand, two were copied around the time of his death by [[Adam Pinkhurst]], a scribe with whom he seems to have worked closely before, giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the ''Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney, ‘Chaucer’s Scribe’, ''Speculum'', 81 (2006), 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer's generation of English-speakers was among the last to pronounce ''e'' at the end of words (so for Chaucer the word &lt;care&gt; was pronounced {{IPA-enm|ˈkaːrə|}}, not {{IPA-en|ˈkɛər|}} as in modern English). This meant that later copyists tended to be inconsistent in their copying of final -''e'' and this for many years gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ian Robinson, ''Chaucer's Prosody: A Study of the Middle English Verse Tradition'' (London: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; It has now been established, however, that -''e'' was an important part of Chaucer's morphology (having a role in distinguishing, for example, singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative).&lt;ref&gt;Seminal studies included M. L. Samuels, 'Chaucerian Final '-e' ', ''Notes and Queries'', 19 (1972), 445-48 and D. Burnley, 'Inflection in Chaucer's Adjectives', ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 83 (1982), 169-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation of Chaucer's writing otherwise differs most prominently from Modern English in that his language had not undergone the [[Great Vowel Shift]]: pronouncing Chaucer's vowels as they would be pronounced today in European languages like Italian, Spanish or German generally produces pronunciations more like Chaucer's own than Modern English pronunciation would. In addition, sounds now written in English but not pronounced were still pronounced by Chaucer: the word &lt;knight&gt; for Chaucer was {{IPA|[knixt]}}, not {{IPA|[naɪt]}}. The pronunciation of Chaucer's poetry can now be reconstructed fairly confidently through detailed philological research; the following gives an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] reconstruction of the opening lines of ''The Merchant's Prologue''; it is likely, moreover, that when a word ending in a vowel was followed by a word beginning in a vowel, the two vowels were [[Elision|elided]] into one syllable, as seen here (with care and...):

No other work prior to Chaucer's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage. It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the [[English Pui]] was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of the ''Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen &quot;master of ceremonies&quot; to guide them and organize the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to the ''Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Plague]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he must have merely read the ''Decameron'' while visiting Italy at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the tales has its own set of sources which have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. These include poetry by [[Ovid]], the [[Bible]] in one of the many vulgate versions it was available in at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to utilize the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as do the works of [[John Gower]], a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard|John Bromyard's]] ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brewer227&quot;&gt;Brewer, p. 227 ''Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brewer277&quot;&gt;Brewer, p. 277 ''...where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose-writers: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these, Petrarch.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendrickson183-192&quot;&gt;Hendrickson , pp. 183-192 Professor G.L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rearden, p. 458 ''There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.'' ''...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skeat (1874), p. xxx '' And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genre and structure===
''Canterbury Tales'' falls into the same category or genre as many other works of its day as a collection of stories organized into a frame narrative or [[frame tale]]. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differed from other stories in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day.  The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] appears to have been a useful device to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes, and was also unprecedented. Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

While the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes, not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first, gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Knight going first, followed by the Monk, but the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favor of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as tales are told which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
The variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with countless rhetorical forms and linguistic styles. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into &quot;majestic persuades&quot;, &quot;temperate pleases&quot;, and &quot;subdued teaches&quot;. Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favoritism to none. He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Chaucer's work thus far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

With this Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a &quot;lady&quot;, while the lower classes use the word &quot;wenche&quot;, with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word &quot;pitee&quot;, for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the [[heroic]] meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical context and themes===
[[Image:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]] ''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, though it was still the only Christian authority in Europe, was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', as is a specific incident involving pardoners (who gathered money in exchange for absolution from sin) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention which allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''[[Tales]]''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself was forced to move to [[Kent]] in order to get away from events in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- ''The Canterbury Tales'' can also tell modern readers much about &quot;[[Occult|the occult]]&quot; during Chaucer's time, especially in regards to [[astrology]] and the [[Western astrology|astrological lore]] prevalent during Chaucer's era. There are hundreds if not thousands of astrological [[allusion]]s found in this work; some are quite overt while others are more subtle in nature.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In 2004, Professor Linne Mooney was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], was able to match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his lettering on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that was transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} While some readers look to interpret the characters of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of his diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique against society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim’s actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} --&gt;
&lt;!--  the theme of marriage common in the tales has been presumed to refer to several different marriages, most often those of [[John of Gaunt]]. Chaucer himself was one of the characters on the pilgrimage, and another character, Harry Bailly of the Tabard Inn, was a real person as well. It is considered quite likely the cook was Roger Knight de Ware, a contemporary London cook. --&gt;

====Religion====
The ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behavior of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 49-51, 56-62&lt;/ref&gt; Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Two characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. A pardoner in Chaucer's day was a person from whom one bought Church &quot;indulgences&quot; for forgiveness of sins, but pardoners were often thought guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; The Summoner is a Church officer who brought sinners to the church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them in order to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins he is threatening to bring others to court for, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Friar's Tale]]'', one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]
Churchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 73-75, 81&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 91-95&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Prioress's Tale]]'' is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] which became a part of English literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html &quot;The Prioress's Tale&quot;], by prof. [[Jane Zatta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 99-102&lt;/ref&gt; but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 110-113&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together, and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 117-119&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social class and convention====
[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bors]]' Dilemma - he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]
The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield, yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 123-131&lt;/ref&gt; Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealized in order to strengthen their fighting ability.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 132-134&lt;/ref&gt; Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, often its conflicting values degenerated into violence. Church leaders often tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'' shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealize, with both knights willing to fight the other to the death in order to win her. Chivalry was in Chaucer's day on the decline, and it is possible that ''The Knight's Tale'' was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 139-142&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasized chivalry during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Two tales, ''[[Chaucer's Tale of Sir Topas|The Tale of Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'' are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry—the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]; the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being &quot;those who pray&quot; (the clergy), &quot;those who fight&quot; (the nobility), and &quot;those who work&quot; (the commoners and peasantry).&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some &quot;quit&quot; (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition &quot;the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.&quot;&lt;ref name=opp&gt;Cooper, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Several works of the time contained the same opposition.&lt;ref name=opp/&gt;

====Relativism vs. realism====
Chaucer's characters each express different—sometimes vastly different—views of reality, creating an atmosphere of relativism. As Helen Cooper says, &quot;Different genres give different readings of the world: the fabliau scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.&quot; The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularizing the literary use of the [[vernacular]], [[English language|English]], rather than [[French language|French]] or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries&amp;mdash;[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]&amp;mdash;also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is interesting to note that, although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as [[The Floure and the Leafe|The Flower and the Leaf]] which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owes much more to the innovations made by the  [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Reception==
[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]
[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]
While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the [[Book of the Duchess]] is known to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 294-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of &quot;best-seller&quot; status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as decorated and fancified as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate|John Lydgate's]] religious and historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 295-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th century===
John Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to truly show what the language was capable of poetically. This sentiment is universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with &quot;sentence&quot; and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 298-302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary additions and supplements==
The incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales in order to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, Stephanie. ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002. ISBN 0-8166-3823-3 pp. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[Bérinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 86-88, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lydgate wrote ''[[The Siege of Thebes]]'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterizes himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the tales. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]] and several editions for centuries after followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 88-97&lt;/ref&gt;

There are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Charlotte. ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. ISBN 0-521-34250-3 pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340-1370.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlgren, Thomas et.al. Medieval Outlaws. City: Parlor Press, 2005. ISBN 1-932559-62-0 pp. 264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary adaptations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
The title of the work has become an everyday phrase and been variously adapted and adopted, as for example in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''.

Many literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage.  Science fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] - ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.

[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.

Historical mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of the story frame and of Chaucer's characters.

The graphic novel ''Worlds' End'', part of Neil Gaiman's ''The Sandman'' series, has the same basic storyline as ''The Canterbury Tales''. Several very different people meet in an inn and agree to tell tales while they wait for a storm to end.

British author JK Rowling cites ''The Pardoner's Tale'', one of ''The Canterbury Tales'', as her inspiration for the fairy tale ''The Tale of Three Brothers''. In the Harry Potter series, &quot;The Tale Of The Three Brothers&quot; appears in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', the final book of the series.

Though lyricist Keith Reid denies any similarity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.procolharum.com/kr_huffington_int.htm Procolharum.com]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]&quot;, by [[Procol Harum]] may contain a reference to Chaucer's work: &quot;...''And so it was, later, as the miller told his tale, that her face, at first just ghostly, turned a whiter shade of pale''.&quot;

Canadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote backcountry ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.

==Stage and film adaptations==
''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot;, was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath’s Tale, The Pardoner’s Tale and The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] - first staged in 1964.

''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell (director)|Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, are making their way to Canterbury together.  The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognized as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Steve. ''Chaucer at Large''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000. ISBN 0-8166-3376-2 pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;Pencak, William. ''The Films of Derek Jarman.'' Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Co, 2002. ISBN 0-7864-1430-8 pp. 178-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Several more recent films, while they are not based on the tales, do have heavy references to them. For example, in the 1995 film ''[[Seven (film)|Se7en]]'', the ''[[Parson's Tale]]'' is an important clue to the methods of a serial killer who chooses his victims based on the [[seven deadly sins]].&lt;ref&gt;Bignell, Jonathan. ''Postmodern Media Culture.'' City: Aakar Books, 2007. ISBN 81-89833-16-2 pp. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 film, ''[[A Knight's Tale (film)|A Knight's Tale]]'' took its name from &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot;. Although it bears little resemblance to the tale, it does feature what Martha Driver and Sid Ray call an &quot;MTV-generation&quot; Chaucer who is a gambling addict with a way with words. Scattered references to the ''Tales'' include Chaucer's declaration that he will use his verse to vilify a summoner and a pardoner who have cheated him.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Jonathan et.al. ''The Medieval Hero on Screen.'' Jefferson: McFarland, 2004. ISBN 0-7864-1926-1 pp. 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Television adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for [[BBC2]]: ''Trinity Tales''. In this adaptation, the stories were told by a party of [[rugby league]] supporters on their way to a [[cup final]] at [[Wembley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1194656/index.html Screen Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2004, [[BBC]] again featured modern re-tellings of selected tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=BBC - Drama - Canterbury Tales |accessdate=2007-05-06 |format= |work=[[BBC]] Drama article about the series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christine de Pisan''' (also seen as de Pizan) (1363 – c. 1430) was a [[Venice|Venetian]]-born woman of the [[medieval]] era who strongly challenged [[misogyny]] and stereotypes prevalent in the male-dominated medieval culture. As a poet, she was well known and highly regarded in her own day.

She spent most of her childhood and all of her adult life primarily in Paris and then the abbey at [[Poissy]], and wrote entirely in her adoptive tongue of [[Middle French]]. Her early courtly poetry is marked by her knowledge of aristocratic custom and fashion of the day, particularly involving women and the practice of chivalry. Her early and later allegorical and didactic treatises reflect both autobiographical information about her life and views and also her own individualized and protofeminist approach to the scholastic learned tradition of mythology, legend, and history she inherited from clerical scholars and to the genres and courtly or scholastic subjects of contemporary French and Italian poets she admired. Supported and encouraged by important royal French and English patrons, Christine had a profound influence on fifteenth-century English poetry. 
Christine completed forty-one pieces during her thirty-year career (1399–1429). She earned her accolade as Europe’s first professional woman writer.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Redfern, &quot;Christine de Pisan and The Treasure of the City of Ladies: A Medieval Rhetorician and Her Rhetoric&quot; in Lunsford, Andrea A, ed. Reclaiming Rhetorica: Women and in the Rhetorical Tradition(Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Her success stems from a wide range of innovative writing and rhetorical techniques that critically challenged renowned male writers, such as [[Jean de Meun]] who, to Christine’s dismay, incorporated misogynist beliefs within their literary works.
She married in 1380, at the age of 15 and was widowed 10 years later. Much of the impetus for her writing came from her need to earn a living for herself and her three children.

In recent decades, Christine's work has been returned to prominence by the efforts of scholars such as Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Certain scholars have argued that she should be seen as an early [[feminist]] who efficiently used language to convey that women could play an important role within society. This characterization has been challenged by other critics who claim either that it is an anachronistic use of the word, or that her beliefs were not progressive enough to merit such a designation.
&lt;ref&gt;Earl Jeffrey Richards, ed, Reinterpreting Christine de Pizan (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1992), pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
{{French literature (small)}}
Christine de Pizan was born in 1363 in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. She was the daughter of Tommaso di Benvenuto da Pizzano (Thomas de Pizan; named for the family's origins in the town of Pizzano, south east of Bologna), a physician, court astrologer, and Councillor of the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine de Pizan, The Book of the City of Ladies, trans. by Rosalind Brown-Grant (London: Penguin Books, 1999), introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Christine’s birth, Thomas de Pizan accepted an appointment to the court of [[Charles V of France]], as the king’s [[astrologer]], [[Alchemy|alchemist]], and [[physician]]. In this atmosphere, Christine was able to pursue her intellectual interests. She successfully educated herself by immersing herself in languages, in the rediscovered classics and humanism of the early Renaissance, and in Charles V’s royal archive that housed a vast number of manuscripts. Pizan did not assert her intellectual abilities, or establish her authority as a writer until she was widowed at the age of twenty-four.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Christine de Pizan married Etienne du Castel, a royal secretary to the court, at the age of fifteen. She bore three children, a daughter (who went to live at the Dominican Abbey in Poissy in 1397 as a companion to the king's daughter, Marie), a son Jean, and another child who died in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Charity C. Willard, Christine de Pizan: Her Life and Works (New York: Persea Books, 1984), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Christine’s familial life was threatened in 1390 when her husband, while in [[Beauvais]] on a mission with the king, suddenly died in an epidemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willard, p. 39&quot;&gt;Willard, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Castel’s death, Christine was left to support her mother, a niece, and her two children.&lt;ref&gt;Pizan, ed. by Brown-Grant, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; When she tried to collect money from her husband’s estate, she faced complicated lawsuits regarding the recovery of salary due to her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willard, p. 39&quot;/&gt; In order to support herself and her family, Christine turned to writing. By 1393, she was writing love [[ballads]], which caught the attention of wealthy patrons within the court. These patrons were intrigued by the novelty of a female writer and had her compose texts about their romantic exploits.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Christine's output during this period was prolific. Between 1393 and 1412, she composed over three hundred ballads, and many more shorter poems.

[[Image:Christine de Pisan and Queen Isabeau detail.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Christine de Pizan presents her book to Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]].]]

Christine de Pizan’s participation in a literary quarrel, in 1401–1402, allowed her to move beyond the courtly circles, and ultimately to establish her status as a writer concerned with the position of women in society. During these years, she involved herself in a renowned literary debate, the “Querelle du Roman de la Rose”.&lt;ref&gt;Willard, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Christine helped to instigate this debate by beginning to question the literary merits of Jean de Meun’s the ''[[Roman de la Rose|Romance of the Rose]]''. Written in the thirteenth century, the ''Romance of the Rose'' satirizes the conventions of courtly love while critically depicting women as nothing more than seducers. Christine specifically objected to the use of vulgar terms in Jean de Meun’s allegorical poem. She argued that these terms denigrated the proper and natural function of sexuality, and that such language was inappropriate for female characters such as [[Reason|Madame Raison]]. According to Christine, noble women did not use such language.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Quilligan, The Allegory of Female Authority: Christine de Pizan's &quot;Cité des Dames&quot; (New York: Cornell University Press, 1991), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Her critique primarily stems from her belief that Jean de Meun was purposely slandering women through the debated text.

The debate itself is extensive and at its end, the principal issue was no longer Jean de Meun’s literary capabilities. The principal issue had shifted to the unjust slander of women within literary texts. This dispute helped to establish Christine’s reputation as a female intellectual who could assert herself effectively and defend her claims in the male-dominated literary realm. Christine continued to counter abusive literary treatments of women.

==Work==
[[Image:Meister der 'Cité des Dames' 002.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Picture from ''The Book of the City of Ladies'']]
By 1405, Christine de Pisan had completed her most successful literary works, ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' and ''The Treasure of the City of Ladies'', or ''[[The Book of the Three Virtues]]''. The first of these shows the importance of women’s past contributions to society, and the second strives to teach women of all estates how to cultivate useful qualities in order to counteract the growth of misogyny (Willard 1984:135).

Christine’s final work was a poem eulogizing [[Joan of Arc]], the peasant girl who took a very public role in organizing French military resistance to English domination in the early fifteenth century. Written in 1429, ''The Tale of Joan of Arc'' celebrates the appearance of a woman military leader who, according to Christine, vindicated and rewarded all women’s efforts to defend their own sex (Willard 1984:205). Besides its literary qualities, this poem is important to historians because it is the only record of Joan of Arc outside the documents of her trial. After completing this particular poem, it seems that Christine, at the age of sixty-five, decided to end her literary career (Willard 1984:207). The exact date of her death is unknown. However, her death did not diminish appreciation for her renowned literary works. Instead, her legacy continued on because of the voice she established as an authoritative rhetorician.

In the “Querelle du Roman de la Rose,” Christine responded to Jean de Montreuil, who had written her a treatise defending the misogynist sentiments in the ''Romance of the Rose''. She begins by claiming that her opponent was an “expert in rhetoric” as compared to herself “a woman ignorant of subtle understanding and agile sentiment.” In this particular apologetic response, Christine belittles her own style. She is employing a rhetorical strategy by writing against the grain of her meaning, also known as [[antiphrasis]] (Redfern 80). Her ability to employ rhetorical strategies continued when Christine began to compose literary texts following the “Querelle du Roman de la Rose.” 

In ''The Book of the City of Ladies'' Christine de Pizan created a symbolic city in which women are appreciated and defended. Christine, having no female literary tradition to call upon, constructs three allegorical foremothers: Reason, Justice, and Rectitude. She enters into a dialogue, a movement between question and answer, with these allegorical figures that is from a completely female perspective (Campbell 6). These constructed women lift Christine up from her despair over the misogyny prevalent in her time. Together, they create a forum to speak on issues of consequence to all women. Only female voices, examples and opinions provide evidence within this text. Christine, through Lady Reason in particular, argues that stereotypes of woman can be sustained only if women are prevented from entering the dominant male-oriented conversation (Campbell 7). Overall, Christine hoped to establish truths about women that contradicted the negative stereotypes that she had identified in previous literature. She did this successfully by creating literary foremothers that helped her to formulate a female dialogue that celebrated women and their accomplishments.

In ''The Treasure of the City of Ladies'', Christine highlights the persuasive effect of women’s speech and actions in everyday life. In this particular text, Christine argues that women must recognize and promote their ability to make peace. This ability will allow women to mediate between husband and subjects. She also claims that slanderous speech erodes one’s honor and threatens the sisterly bond among women. Christine then argues that &quot;skill in discourse should be a part of every woman’s moral repertoire&quot; (Redfern 87). Christine understood that a woman’s influence is realized when her speech accords value to chastity, virtue, and restraint. She proved that rhetoric is a powerful tool that women could employ to settle differences and to assert themselves. Overall, she presented a concrete strategy that allowed all women, regardless of their status, to undermine the dominant patriarchal discourse. For the general reader the ''Treasure'' is appealing because she gives fascinating glimpses into women's lives in 1400, from the great lady in the castle down to the merchant's wife, the servant, and the peasant. She offers advice to governesses, widows, and even prostitutes.

Christine specifically sought out other women to collaborate in the creation of her work. She makes special mention of a manuscript illuminator we know only as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]] who she described as the most talented of her day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripleyonline.com/Under%20Discussion/Christine/Christine.htm Christine de Pizan: An illuminated Voice ] By Doré Ripley, 2004 Accessed October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Christine de Pizan contributed to the rhetorical tradition by counteracting the contemporary discourse. Rhetorical scholars have studied her persuasive strategies. It has been concluded that Christine successfully forged a rhetorical identity for herself, and encouraged women to embrace this identity by counteracting misogynist thinking through persuasive dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Needs Reference&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote in 1949 that ''Épître au Dieu d'Amour'' was &quot;the first time we see a woman take up her pen in defense of her sex&quot; making Christine de Pizan perhaps the West's first feminist, or [[protofeminist]] as some scholars prefer to say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Beauvoir, Simone|title=The Second Sex|year=1989|first=English translation 1953|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=105|isbn=0-679-72451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneir-1994&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneir, Miram|title=Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings|year=1994|first=1972|publisher=Vintage Books|page=xiv|isbn=0-679-75381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Catharism''' was a name given to a Christian religious sect with [[dualism|dualistic]] and [[gnosticism|gnostic]] elements that appeared in the [[Languedoc]] region of France and other parts of Europe in the 11th century and flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries. Catharism had its roots in the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] movement in [[Armenia]] and the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] of [[Bulgaria]] which took influences from the Paulicians. Though the term &quot;Cathar&quot; has been used for centuries to identify the movement, whether the movement self-identified itself with this name is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg, Mark, “On Cathars, Albigenses, and good men of Languedoc,&quot; Journal of Medieval History 27: 2 (2001),181-19; Pegg, Mark, “Heresy, good men, and nomenclature,” in Heresy and the Persecuting Society in the Middle Ages, ed. Michael FRASSETTO (Studies in the History of Christian Traditions, 129). Leiden: Brill. (2006) 227-239&lt;/ref&gt; In Cathar texts, the terms &quot;Good Men&quot; (''Bons Hommes'') or &quot;Good Christians&quot; are the common terms of self-identification. 

==Introduction==
Like many medieval movements, there were various schools of thought and practice amongst the Cathari; some were dualistic (believing in a God of Good and a God of Evil), others Gnostic, some closer to orthodoxy while abstaining from an acceptance of [[Catholicism]]. The dualist theology  was the most prominent, however, and was based upon an asserted complete incompatibility of love and power. As matter was seen as a manifestation of power, it was believed to be incompatible with love.

The Cathari did not believe in one all-encompassing god, but in two, both equal and comparable in status. They held that the physical world was evil and created by [[Rex Mundi]] (translated from [[Latin language|Latin]] as &quot;king of the world&quot;), who encompassed all that was corporeal, chaotic and powerful; the second god, the one whom they worshipped, was entirely disincarnate: a being or principle of pure spirit and completely unsullied by the taint of matter. He was the god of love, order and peace.

According to some Cathars, the purpose of man's life on Earth was to transcend matter, perpetually renouncing anything connected with the principle of power and thereby attaining union with the principle of love. According to others, man's purpose was to reclaim or redeem matter, spiritualising and transforming it.

This placed them at odds with the Catholic Church regarding material creation, on behalf of which Jesus had died, as being intrinsically evil and implying that God, whose word had created the world in the beginning, was a usurper. Furthermore, as the Cathars saw matter as intrinsically evil, they denied that Jesus could become incarnate and still be the son of God.  Cathars vehemently repudiated the significance of the [[crucifixion]] and the cross. In fact, to the Cathars, Rome's opulent and luxurious Church seemed a palpable embodiment and manifestation on Earth of Rex Mundi's sovereignty.

The Catholic Church regarded the sect as dangerously [[heresy|heretical]], although the actual reason for its spread was most likely the discredit of the Church itself in the Medieval society. 

Faced with the rapid spread of the movement across the Languedoc region, the Church first sought peaceful attempts at conversion, undertaken by [[Dominican order|Dominicans]]. These were not very successful and after the murder on 15 January 1208 of the papal legate [[Pierre de Castelnau]] by an unknown person, presumed by Pope Innocent III to have been a knight in the employ of [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse|Count Raymond of Toulouse]], the Church called for a crusade.  This was carried out by knights from [[northern France]] and Germany and was known as the [[Albigensian Crusade]].

The papal legate had involved himself in a dispute between the rivals Count of Baux and Count Raymond of Toulouse and it is possible that his assassination had little to do with Catharism. The anti-Cathar Albigensian Crusade, and the [[inquisition]] which followed it, entirely eradicated the Cathars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/travel/09Languedoc.html|author=Perrottet, Tony|title=The Besieged and the Beautiful in Languedoc|publisher=The New York Times|date=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albigensian Crusade had the effect of greatly weakening the semi-independent southern Principalities such as [[Toulouse]], whose [[Occitan language]] was playing an important role in Western Europe, and ultimately bringing them under direct control of the [[King of France]].

==Origins==
The Cathars' beliefs are thought to have come originally from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] by way of [[trade route]]s. The name of [[Bulgarians]] (''Bougres'') was also applied to the Albigenses, and they maintained an association with the similar Christian movement of the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] (&quot;Friends of God&quot;) of [[Thrace]]. &quot;That there was a substantial transmission of ritual and ideas from Bogomilism to Catharism is beyond reasonable doubt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Lambert|1998|p=31}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Their doctrines have numerous resemblances to those of the Bogomils and the earlier [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] as well as the [[Manicheans]] and the Christian [[Gnostics]] of the first few centuries AD, although, as many scholars, most notably [[Mark Gregory Pegg|Mark Pegg]], have pointed out, it would be erroneous to extrapolate direct, historical connections based on theoretical similarities perceived by modern scholars. Much of our existing knowledge of the Cathars is derived from their opponents, the writings of the Cathars mostly having been destroyed because of the doctrinal threat perceived by the Papacy. For this reason it is likely, as with most heretical movements of the period, that we have only a partial view of their beliefs. Conclusions about Cathar ideology continue to be fiercely debated with commentators regularly accusing their opponents of speculation, distortion and bias. There are a few texts from the Cathars themselves which were preserved by their opponents (the ''Rituel Cathare de Lyon'') which give a glimpse of the inner workings of their faith, but these still leave many questions unanswered. One large text which has survived, ''The Book of Two Principles'' (''Liber de duobus principiis''),&lt;ref&gt;Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; elaborates the principles of dualistic theology from the point of view of some of the [[Albanenses]] Cathars.

It is now generally agreed by most scholars that identifiable Catharism did not emerge until at least 1143, when the first confirmed report of a group espousing similar beliefs is reported being active at Cologne by the cleric Eberwin of Steinfeld.&lt;ref&gt;See especially R.I. Moore's ''[[The Origins of European Dissent]]'', and the collection of essays ''[[Heresy and the Persecuting Society in the Middle Ages: Essays on the Work of R.I. Moore]]'' for a consideration of the origins of the Cathars, and proof against identifying earlier heretics in the West, such as those identified in 1025 at Monforte, outside [[Milan]], as being Cathars.  Also see ''Heresies of the High Middle Ages'', a collection of pertinent documents on Western heresies of the High Middle Ages, edited by Walter Wakefield and Austin P. Evans.&lt;/ref&gt; A landmark in the &quot;institutional history&quot; of the Cathars was the [[Council of Saint-Félix|Council]], held in 1167 at [[Saint-Félix-Lauragais]], attended by many local figures and also by the [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] ''papa'' [[Nicetas, Bogomil bishop|Nicetas]], the Cathar bishop of [[France|(northern) France]] and a leader of the Cathars of [[Lombardy]].

Although there are certainly similarities in theology and practice between Gnostic/dualist groups of Late Antiquity (such as the [[Marcionism|Marcionites]] or [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]]) and the Cathars, there was not a direct link between the two; Manichaeanism died out in the West by the 7th century. The Cathars were largely a homegrown, Western European/Latin Christian phenomenon, springing up in the Rhineland cities (particularly Cologne) in the mid-12th century, northern France around the same time, and particularly southern France—the Languedoc—and the northern Italian cities in the mid-late 12th century. In the Languedoc and northern Italy, the Cathars would enjoy their greatest popularity, surviving in the Languedoc, in much reduced form, up to around 1325 and in the Italian cities until the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisitions]] of the 1260s–1300s finally rooted them out.&lt;ref&gt;See Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie's ''Montaillou: the Promised Land of Error'' for a respected analysis of the social context of these last French Cathars, and ''Power and Purity'' by Carol Lansing for a consideration of 13th-century Catharism in Orvieto.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General beliefs==
Cathars, in general, formed an anti-[[sacerdotal]] party in opposition to the Catholic Church, protesting what they perceived to be the moral, spiritual and political corruption of the Church. They claimed an [[Apostolic succession]] from the founders of Christianity, and saw Rome as having betrayed and corrupted the original purity of the message, particularly since [[Pope Sylvester I]] accepted the [[Donation of Constantine]] (which at the time was believed to be genuine).

{{Quotation|
... they usually say of themselves that they are good Christians, ... hold the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ and his gospel as the apostles taught ... occupy the place of the apostles....

...they talk to the laity of the evil lives of the clerks and prelates of the Roman Church...

... they attack and vituperate, in turn, all the sacraments of the Church, especially the sacrament of the eucharist, saying that it cannot contain the body of Christ...

Of baptism, they assert that the water is material and corruptible ... and cannot sanctify the soul...

... they claim that confession made to the priests of the Roman Church is useless... They assert, moreover, that the cross of Christ should not be adored or venerated...

Moreover they read from the Gospels and the Epistles in the vulgar tongue, applying and expounding them in their favour and against the condition of the Roman Church...
|[[Bernard Gui]]|On the Albigensians}}

===Sacred texts===
Besides the New Testament, Cathar sacred texts include The Gospel of the Secret Supper, or John's Interrogation&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=MImaI4bS6-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Gnostic+Bible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=74Vc8_sEde&amp;sig=4wLrXPqAZYBtbNxaJfiI69iUf6Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1otETOmdCYr60wS7v_mnDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt; and The Book of the Two Principles.

===Human condition===
The Cathars believed there existed within mankind a spark of divine light. This light, or spirit, had fallen into captivity within a realm of corruption identified with the physical body and world. This was a distinct feature of classical [[Gnosticism]], of [[Manichaeism]] and of the theology of the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]]. This concept of the human condition within Catharism was most probably due to direct and indirect historical influences from these older (and sometimes violently suppressed) Gnostic movements. According to the Cathars, the world had been created by a lesser deity, much like the figure known in classical Gnostic myth as the [[Demiurge]]. This creative force was identified with [[Satan]]; most forms of classical Gnosticism had not made this explicit link between the Demiurge and Satan. Spirit, the vital essence of humanity, was thus trapped in a polluted world created by a usurper God and ruled by his corrupt minions.

===Eschatology===
The goal of Cathar [[eschatology]] was liberation from the realm of limitation and corruption identified with material existence. The path to liberation first required an awakening to the intrinsic corruption of the medieval &quot;consensus reality&quot;, including its ecclesiastical, [[dogma]]tic, and social structures. Once cognizant of the grim existential reality of human existence (the &quot;prison&quot; of [[matter]]), the path to spiritual liberation became obvious: matter's enslaving bonds must be broken. This was a step-by-step process, accomplished in different measures by each individual. The Cathars accepted the idea of [[reincarnation]]. Those who were unable to achieve liberation during their current mortal journey would return another time to continue the struggle for perfection. Thus, it should be understood that being reincarnated was neither inevitable nor desirable, and that it occurred because not all humans could break the enthralling chains of matter within a single lifetime.

===Consolamentum===
Cathar society was divided into two general categories, the ''[[Cathar Perfect|Perfecti]]'' (Perfects, Parfaits) and the ''[[Credentes]]'' (Believers). The Perfecti formed the core of the movement, though the actual number of Perfecti in Cathar society was always relatively small, numbering perhaps a few thousand at any one time. Regardless of their number, they represented the perpetuating heart of the Cathar tradition, the &quot;true Christian Church&quot;, as they styled themselves. (When discussing the tenets of Cathar faith it must be understood that the demands of extreme [[asceticism]] fell only upon the Perfecti.)

An individual entered into the community of Perfecti through a [[ritual]] known as the ''consolamentum'', a rite that was both sacramental and sacerdotal in nature: sacramental in that it granted redemption and liberation from this world; sacerdotal in that those who had received this rite functioned in some ways as the Cathar clergy—though the idea of priesthood was explicitly rejected. The consolamentum was the [[baptism]] of the [[Holy Spirit]], baptismal regeneration, [[absolution]], and [[ordination]] all in one. The ritual consisted of the laying on of hands (and the transfer of the spirit) in a manner believed to have been passed down in unbroken succession from Jesus Christ. Upon reception of the consolamentum, the new Perfectus surrendered his or her worldly goods to the community, vested himself in a simple black or blue robe with cord belt, and sought to undertake a life dedicated to following the example of [[Christ]] and his [[Apostles]] — an often peripatetic life devoted to purity, prayer, preaching and charitable work. Above all, the Perfecti were dedicated to enabling others to find the road that led from the dark land ruled by the dark lord, to the realm of light which they believed to be humankind's first source and ultimate end.

While the Perfecti pledged themselves to [[asceticism|ascetic]] lives of [[simplicity]], frugality and purity, Cathar ''credentes'' (believers) were not expected to adopt the same stringent lifestyle. They were, however, expected to refrain from eating [[meat]] and [[dairy]] products, from killing and from swearing [[oath]]s. Catharism was above all a populist religion and the numbers of those who considered themselves &quot;believers&quot; in the late 12th century included a sizeable portion of the population of Languedoc, counting among them many noble families and courts. These individuals often drank, ate meat, and led relatively normal lives within medieval society—in contrast to the Perfecti, whom they honoured as exemplars. Though unable to embrace the life of chastity, the credentes looked toward an eventual time when this would be their calling and path.

Many credentes would also eventually receive the consolamentum as death drew near—performing the ritual of liberation at a moment when the heavy obligations of purity required of Perfecti would be temporally short. Some of those who received the sacrament of the consolamentum upon their death-beds may thereafter have shunned further food or drink in order to speed death. This has been termed the ''endura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Alexander | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Suicide in the Middle Ages | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = | location = | pages = | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=Zsw1jJx5t9YC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=endura+cathar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b-9seroLhI&amp;sig=UWG4_Ks_kKqF3k1hbhXkGwzNwZM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dcifScXSOYG4twfu2fH7DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result | doi = | id = | isbn = 0198205392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by Catharism's opponents that by such self-imposed starvation, the Cathars were committing suicide in order to escape this world.  Other than at such moments of ''extremis'', little evidence exists to suggest this was a common Cathar practice.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, M. (2000). ''The Cathars: Dualist heretics in Languedoc in the High Middle Ages,'' pp. 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
The Catharist concept of Jesus resembled [[modalistic monarchianism]] (Sabellianism) in the West and [[adoptionism]] in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Encyclopedia, 2007, Columbia University Press, under Cathari&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Albigensians&lt;/ref&gt; Some Cathari adhered to a concept of Jesus that might be called [[docetism|docetistic]], believing that Jesus had been a manifestation of spirit unbounded by the limitations of matter—a sort of divine spirit or ''feeling'' manifesting within human beings. Many embraced the ''[[Gospel of John]]'' as their most sacred text, and many rejected the traditional view of the [[Old Testament]]—proclaiming that the God of the [[Old Testament]] was really the [[devil]], or creative demiurge. They proclaimed that there was a higher God—the True God—and Jesus was variously described as being that True God or his messenger. These are views similar to those of [[Marcion]], though Marcion never identified the creative demiurge with Satan, nor said that he was (strictly speaking) evil, merely harsh and dictatorial.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The God found in the Old Testament had nothing to do with the God of Love known to Cathars. The Old Testament God had created the world as a [[prison]], and demanded from the &quot;prisoners&quot; fearful obedience and worship. The Cathari claimed that this god was in fact a blind usurper who under the most false pretexts, tormented and murdered those whom he called, all too possessively, &quot;his children&quot;. The false god was, by the Cathari, called ''Rex Mundi'', or ''The King of the World''. This [[exegesis]] upon the Old Testament was not unique to the Cathars: it echoes views found in earlier [[Gnostic]] movements and foreshadows later critical voices. The dogma of the [[Trinity]] and the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]], among others, were rejected as abominations. Belief in [[Reincarnation|metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls]], resulted in the rejection of [[Hell]] and [[Purgatory]], which were and are dogmas of the Catholic faith. For the Cathars, this world was the only [[hell]]—there was nothing to fear after death, save perhaps rebirth.

While this is the understanding of Cathar theology related by the Catholic Church, crucial to the study of the Cathars is their fundamental disagreement with both the Christian interpretation of the Doctrine of &quot;resurrection&quot; (cryptically referred to in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|26:19|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:2|NIV}}) as a doctrine of the physical raising of a dead body from the grave. In the book &quot;Massacre at [[Montségur]]&quot; the Cathars are referred to as &quot;Western Buddhists&quot; because of their belief that the Doctrine of &quot;resurrection&quot; taught by Jesus was, in fact, similar to the Buddhist Doctrine of Rebirth (referred to as &quot;reincarnation&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''Massacre at Montsegur: A History of the Albigensian Crusade'', Zoe Oldenbourg&lt;/ref&gt; This challenge to the orthodox Christian interpretation of the &quot;resurrection&quot; reflected a conflict previously witnessed during the 2nd and 3rd centuries between Gnosticism and developing orthodox Christian theology.

===Social relationships===
From the theological underpinnings of the Cathar faith there came practical injunctions that were considered destabilising to the morals of medieval society. For instance, Cathars rejected the giving of oaths as wrongful; an oath served to place one under the domination of the Demiurge and the world.  To reject oaths in this manner was seen as anarchic in a society where illiteracy was widespread and almost all business transactions and pledges of allegiance were based on the giving of oaths.

Sexual intercourse and reproduction propagated the slavery of spirit to flesh, hence procreation was considered undesirable. Informal relationships were considered preferable to marriage among Cathar credentes. Perfecti were supposed to have observed complete celibacy, and eventual separation from a partner would be necessary for those who would become Perfecti. For the credentes however, sexual activity was not prohibited, but procreation was strongly discouraged, resulting in the charge by their opponents of sexual perversion. The common English insult &quot;[[bugger]]&quot; is derived from &quot;Bulgar&quot;, the notion that Cathars followed the &quot;[[Bogomilism|Bulgarian heresy]]&quot; whose teaching included sexual activities which skirted procreation.

Killing was abhorrent to the Cathars. Consequently, abstention from all animal food ([[Pescetarianism|sometimes exempting fish]]) was enjoined of the Perfecti.  The Perfecti apparently avoided eating anything considered to be a by-product of sexual reproduction {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}—war and [[capital punishment]] were also condemned, an abnormality in the medieval age. As a consequence of their rejection of oaths, Cathars also rejected marriage vows. Such was the situation, that when called before the [[Inquisition]], one accused of Catharism needed only to show that he was married for the case to be immediately dismissed.

Such teachings, both in theological intent and practical consequence, brought upon the Cathars condemnation from religious and secular authorities as being the enemies of Christian faith and of social order.

==Suppression==
In 1147, [[Pope Eugene III]] sent a [[Papal legate|legate]] to the Cathar district in order to arrest the progress of the Cathars. The few isolated successes of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] could not obscure the poor results of this mission, which clearly showed the power of the sect in the Languedoc at that period. The missions of [[Cardinal Peter of St. Chrysogonus]] to Toulouse and the Toulousain in 1178, and of [[Henry of Marcy]], [[cardinal-bishop of Albano]], in 1180–81, obtained merely momentary successes. Henry's armed expedition, which took the stronghold at [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]], did not extinguish the movement.

Decisions of Catholic Church councils—in particular, those of the Council of [[Tours]] (1163) and of the [[Third Council of the Lateran]] (1179)—had scarcely more effect upon the Cathars.  When [[Pope Innocent III]] came to power in 1198, he was resolved to deal with them.

At first Innocent tried pacific conversion, and sent a number of legates into the Cathar regions. They had to contend not only with the Cathars, the nobles who protected them, and the people who venerated them, but also with many of the [[bishop]]s of the region, who resented the considerable authority the [[Pope]] had conferred upon his legates. In 1204, Innocent III suspended a number of bishops in [[Occitania]]; in 1205 he appointed a new and vigorous [[bishop of Toulouse]], the former [[troubadour]] [[Folquet de Marselha|Foulques]]. In 1206 [[Diego of Osma]] and his canon, the future [[Saint Dominic]], began a programme of conversion in Languedoc; as part of this, Catholic-Cathar public debates were held at [[Verfeil, Haute-Garonne|Verfeil]], [[Servian (commune)|Servian]], [[Pamiers]], [[Montréal, Aude|Montréal]] and elsewhere.

[[Saint Dominic]] met and debated the Cathars in 1203 during his mission to the Languedoc. He concluded that only preachers who displayed real sanctity, humility and asceticism could win over convinced Cathar believers. The official Church as a rule did not possess these spiritual warrants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], &quot;A  History of Christianity&quot;, p251, Atheneum, 1976, ISBN 0689705913&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction led eventually to the establishment of the [[Dominican Order]] in 1216. The order was to live up to the terms of his famous rebuke, &quot;Zeal must be met by zeal, humility by humility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching falsehood by preaching truth.&quot; However, even St. Dominic managed only a few converts among the Cathari.

===Albigensian Crusade===
{{main|Albigensian Crusade}}
In January 1208 the papal legate, [[Pierre de Castelnau]] was sent to meet the ruler of the area, Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]]. Known for excommunicating noblemen who protected the Cathars, Castelnau [[excommunicate]]d Raymond as an [[abettor]] of heresy following an allegedly fierce argument during which Raymond supposedly threatened Castelnau with violence. Shortly thereafter, Castelnau was murdered as he returned to Rome, allegedly by a knight in the service of Count Raymond. His body was returned and laid to rest in the Abbey at Saint Gilles. As soon as he heard of the murder, the Pope ordered the legates to preach a [[Albigensian Crusade|crusade]] against the Cathars and wrote a letter to Phillip Augustus, King of France, appealing for his intervention—or an intervention led by his son, Louis. This was not the first appeal but some have seen the murder of the legate as a turning point in papal policy—whereas it might be more accurate to see it as a fortuitous event in allowing the Pope to excite popular opinion and to renew his pleas for intervention in the south. The entirely biased chronicler of the crusade which was to follow, Peter de Vaux de Cernay, portrays the sequence of events in such a way as to make us believe that, having failed in his effort to peacefully demonstrate the errors of Catharism, the Pope then called a formal crusade, appointing a series of leaders to head the assault. The French King refused to lead the crusade himself, nor could he spare his son—despite his victory against John of England, there were still pressing issues with Flanders and the empire and the threat of an [[House of Châteaudun|Angevin]] revival. Phillip did however sanction the participation of some of his more bellicose and ambitious—some might say dangerous—barons, notably [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] and Bouchard de Marly. There followed twenty years of war against the Cathars and their allies in the Languedoc: the [[Albigensian Crusade]].

This war pitted the nobles of the north of France against those of the south. The widespread northern enthusiasm for the Crusade was partially inspired by a papal decree permitting the confiscation of lands owned by Cathars and their supporters. This not only angered the lords of the south but also the French King, who was at least nominally the suzerain of the lords whose lands were now open to [[Plunder|despoliation]] and seizure. Phillip Augustus wrote to Pope Innocent in strong terms to point this out—but the Pope did not change his policy—and many of those who went to the [[Le Midi|Midi]] were aware that the Pope had been equivocal over the siege of Zara and the seizure and looting of Constantinople. As the Languedoc was supposedly teeming with Cathars and Cathar sympathisers, this made the region a target for northern French noblemen looking to acquire new fiefs. The barons of the north headed south to do battle, their first target the lands of the Trencavel, powerful lords of Albi, Carcassonne and the Razes—but a family with few allies in the Midi. Little was thus done to form a regional coalition and the crusading army was able to take Carcassonne, the Trencavel capital by duplicitous methods, incarcerating Raymond Roger in his own citadel where he died, allegedly of natural causes; champions of the [[Occitania|Occitan]] cause from that day to this believe he was murdered. Simon de Montfort was granted the Trencavel lands by the Pope and did homage for them to the King of France, thus incurring the enmity of Peter of Aragon who had held aloof from the conflict, even acting as a mediator at the time of the siege of Carcassonne. The remainder of the first of the two Cathar wars now essentially focused on Simon's attempt to hold on to his fabulous gains through winters where he was faced, with only a small force of confederates operating from the main winter camp at Fanjeau, with the desertion of local lords who had sworn fealty to him out of necessity—and attempts to enlarge his new found domains in the summer when his forces were greatly augmented by reinforcements from northern France, Germany and elsewhere. Summer campaigns saw him not only retake, sometimes with brutal reprisals, what he had lost in the 'close' season, but also seek to widen his sphere of operation—and we see him in action in the Aveyron at St. Antonin and on the banks of the Rhone at Beaucaire. Simon's greatest triumph was the victory against superior numbers at the [[Battle of Muret]]—a battle which saw not only the defeat of Raymond of Toulouse and his Occitan allies—but also the death of Peter of Aragon—and the effective end of the ambitions of the house of Aragon/Barcelona in the Languedoc. This was in the medium and longer term of much greater significance to the royal house of France than it was to De Montfort—and with the battle of Bouvines was to secure the position of Philip Augustus vis a vis England and the Empire. The [[Battle of Muret]] was a massive step in the creation of the unified French kingdom and the country we know today—although Edward III, the Black Prince and Henry V would threaten later to shake these foundations.

===Massacre===
The crusader army came under the command, both spiritually and militarily, of the papal legate [[Arnaud-Amaury]], [[Abbot]] of [[Cîteaux]]. In the first significant engagement of the war, the town of [[Béziers]] was [[siege|besieged]] on 22 July 1209. The Catholic inhabitants of the city were granted the freedom to leave unharmed, but many refused and opted to stay and fight alongside the Cathars.

The Cathars spent much of 1209 fending off the crusaders. The leader of the crusaders, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], resorted to primitive psychological warfare. He ordered his troops to gouge out the eyes of 100 prisoners, cut off their noses and lips, then send them back to the towers led by a prisoner with one remaining eye. This only served to harden the resolve of the Cathars.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, 9 May 2010. &quot;The Besieged and the Beautiful in Languedoc&quot;, by Tony Perrottet. Link: [http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/travel/09Languedoc.html] Accessed: 11 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Béziers army attempted a [[sortie]] but was quickly defeated, then pursued by the crusaders back through the gates and into the city. Arnaud, the Cistercian abbot-commander, is supposed to have been asked how to tell Cathars from [[Catholics]].  His reply, recalled by [[Caesar of Heisterbach]], a fellow [[Cistercian]], thirty years later was ''&quot;{{lang|la|Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.}}&quot;''—&quot;Kill them all, the Lord will recognise His own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eis.&quot; Caesarius of Heisterbach, Caesarius Heiserbacencis monachi ordinis Cisterciensis, Dialogus miraculorum, ed. J. Strange, Cologne, 1851, J. M. Heberle, Vol 2, 296–8. Caesarius (c) was a Cistercian Master of Novices.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another Cistercian writing a few years after the events makes no mention of this remark whilst Caesar of Heisterbach wrote forty years later, however they are consistent with Arnaud's report to the Pope about the massacre. See &quot;Pope Innocent III (1160/61-1216): To Root Up and to Plant&quot; John Clare Moore, p180, BRILL, 2003,ISBN 9004129251&lt;/ref&gt; The doors of the church of St Mary Magdalene were broken down and the refugees dragged out and slaughtered.  Reportedly, 7,000 people died there.  Elsewhere in the town many more thousands were mutilated and killed.  Prisoners were blinded, dragged behind horses, and used for target practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], &quot;A  History of Christianity&quot;, p252, Atheneum, 1976, ISBN 0689705913&lt;/ref&gt; What remained of the city was razed by fire.  Arnaud wrote to [[Pope Innocent III]], &quot;Today your Holiness, twenty thousand heretics were put to the sword, regardless of rank, age, or sex.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patrologia Latinae cursus completus, series Latina, 221 vols., ed. J-P Migne, Paris, Vol. 216:col 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Chronicle of William of Puylaurens: The Albigensian Crusade and Its Aftermath&quot;, p128,  William, M. D. Sibly, Boydell Press, 2003, ISBN 0851159257&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent population of Béziers at that time was then probably no more than 5,000, but local refugees seeking shelter within the city walls could conceivably have increased the number to 20,000.

After the success of his siege of [[Carcassonne]], which followed the massacre at Béziers, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] was designated as leader of the Crusader army. Prominent opponents of the Crusaders were [[Raymond-Roger de Trencavel]], viscount of Carcassonne, and his feudal overlord [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II]], the king of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], who held fiefdoms and had a number of vassals in the region. Peter died fighting against the crusade on 12 September 1213 at the [[Battle of Muret]].

===Treaty and persecution===
The war ended in the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)]], by which the king of France dispossessed the house of Toulouse of the greater part of its [[fiefdom|fiefs]], and that of the Trencavels ([[Viscount]]s of Béziers and Carcassonne) of the whole of their fiefs. The independence of the princes of the Languedoc was at an end. But in spite of the wholesale massacre of Cathars during the war, Catharism was not yet extinguished.

In 1215, the bishops of the Catholic Church met at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] under [[Pope Innocent III]]. One of the key goals of the council was to combat the heresy of the Cathars.

The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] was established in 1229 to uproot the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, [[Carcassonne]] and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it finally succeeded in extirpating the movement. Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Sean | authorlink = Sean Martin (writer and director) | title = The Cathars | publisher = [[Pocket Essentials]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1904-04833-1 | pages = 105–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of [[Montségur]] was besieged by the troops of the [[seneschal]] of Carcassonne and the [[archbishop of Narbonne]]. On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 [[Cathar Perfect]]s were burnt in an enormous fire at the ''prat des cramats'' near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the Church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of [[Narbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Papal Bull|Bull]] of [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] ''[[Ad exstirpanda]]'', 1252.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CatharCross.JPG|right|framed| Inquisitors required heretical sympathisers - repentant first offenders - to sew a yellow cross onto their clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Weis, René. ''The Yellow Cross: The Story of the Last Cathars.'' (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 2000), 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar Perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at ''prat des cramats''. It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them ''le tresor cathar''. What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars' accumulated wealth.

Hunted by the Inquisition and deserted by the nobles of their districts, the Cathars became more and more scattered fugitives: meeting surreptitiously in forests and mountain wilds. Later insurrections broke out under the leadership of [[Bernard of Foix]], [[Aimery of Narbonne]]{{dn}} and [[Bernard Délicieux]] (a Franciscan friar later prosecuted for his adherence to another heretical movement, that of the Spiritual Franciscans) at the beginning of the 14th century. But by this time the Inquisition had grown very powerful. Consequently, many were summoned to appear before it. Precise indications of this are found in the registers of the Inquisitors, [[Bernard of Caux]], [[Jean de St Pierre]], [[Geoffroy d'Ablis]], and others. The parfaits only rarely recanted, and hundreds were burnt. Repentant lay believers were punished, but their lives were spared as long as they did not relapse. Having recanted, they were obliged to sew yellow crosses onto their outdoor clothing and to live apart from other Catholics, at least for a while.

===Annihilation===
After several decades of harassment and re-proselytising, and perhaps even more importantly, the systematic destruction of their scripture, the sect was exhausted and could find no more adepts. The leaders of a Cathar revival in the Pyrenean foothills, Pierre and Jacques Autier, were executed in 1310. Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s, under pressure from the Inquisition. After 1330, the records of the Inquisition contain very few proceedings against Cathars. The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, [[Guillaume Bélibaste]], was executed in 1321.

Other movements, such as the [[Waldensians]] and the pantheistic [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]], which suffered persecution in the same area survived in remote areas and in small numbers into the 14th and 15th centuries. Some Waldensian ideas were absorbed into early [[Protestant]] sects, such as the [[Hussites]], [[Lollards]], and the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut|Herrnhuters of Germany]]). It is possible that Cathar ideas were too.

==Later history==
After the suppression of Catharism, the descendants of Cathars were at times required to live outside towns and their defences. They thus retained a certain Cathar identity, despite having returned to the Catholic religion.

Any use of the term &quot;Cathar&quot; to refer to people after the suppression of Catharism in the 14th century is a cultural or ancestral reference, and has no religious implication. Nevertheless, interest in the Cathars, their history, legacy and beliefs continues.
The publication of the book ''Crusade against the Grail'' by the young German [[Otto Rahn]] in the 1930s rekindled interest in the connection between the Cathars and the [[Holy Grail]]. Rahn was convinced that the 13th century work ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] was a veiled account of the Cathars. His research attracted the attention of the Nazi government and in particular of [[Heinrich Himmler]], who made him archaeologist in the [[SS]]. Also, the Cathars have been depicted in popular books such as ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''.

===''Pays Cathare''===
[[Image:Montsegur-w02.jpg|thumb|The castle of [[Montségur]] was razed after 1244; the current fortress follows French military architecture of the 17th century]]
The term ''Pays Cathare'', French meaning &quot;Cathar Country&quot; is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. This area is centred around fortresses such as [[Montségur]] and [[Carcassonne]]; also the French [[departments of France|département]] of the [[Aude]] uses the title ''Pays Cathare'' in tourist brochures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payscathare.com/www/contenu/d_payscathare.asp Pays Cathare]&lt;/ref&gt; These areas have ruins from the wars against the Cathars which are still visible today.

Some criticise the promotion of the identity of ''Pays Cathare'' as an exaggeration for [[tourism|tourist]] purposes. Actually, most of the promoted [[Cathar castles]] were not built by Cathars but by local lords and later many of them were rebuilt and extended for strategic purposes.  Good examples of these are the magnificent castles of Queribus and Peyrepetuse which are both perched on the side of precipitous drops on the last folds of the Corbieres mountains. They were for several hundred years frontier fortresses belonging to the French crown and most of what you will see there today in their well preserved remains dates from a post-Cathar era. The Cathars sought refuge at these sites. Many consider the [[County of Foix]] to be the actual historical centre of Catharism.

===Modern adherents===
Some residents of the ''Pays Cathare'' identify themselves as Cathars today. This does ''not'' mean they claim to be Cathar by religion (the local religion is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic). They claim to be descended from the Cathars of the Middle Ages, and therefore Cathar as an identity. It can be safely assumed that many inhabitants of these areas have some ancestors who were Cathars.

==Legacy in art and music==
The principal legacy of the Cathar movement is in the poems and songs of the Cathar [[troubadors]], though this artistic legacy is only a smaller part of the wider [[Provençal]] and [[Occitan]] linguistic and artistic heritage. Recent artistic projects concentrating on the Cathar element in Provençal and troubador art include commercial recording projects by Thomas Binkley,&lt;ref&gt;L'Agonie du Languedoc: Claude Marti / Studio der frühen Musik - Thomas Binkley, dir. EMI &quot;Reflexe&quot; 1C 063-30 132 [LP-Stereo]1975&lt;/ref&gt; La Nef,&lt;ref&gt;La Nef. Montségur: La tragédie cathare.

[[Image:CSF.JPG|thumb|4 vials of CSF]]
'''Cerebrospinal fluid''' ('''CSF'''), ''Liquor cerebrospinalis'', is a clear, colorless [[bodily fluid]], that occupies the [[subarachnoid space]] and the [[ventricular system]] around and inside the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. In essence, the brain &quot;floats&quot; in it.

The CSF occupies the space between the [[arachnoid mater]] (the middle layer of the brain cover, [[meninges]]), and the [[pia mater]] (the layer of the meninges closest to the brain). It constitutes the content of all intra-cerebral (inside the brain, cerebrum) ventricles, cisterns, and [[Sulci (anatomy)|sulci]] (singular sulcus), as well as the [[central canal]] of the [[spinal cord]].

It acts as a &quot;cushion&quot; or buffer for the cortex, providing a basic mechanical and [[immunological]] protection to the brain inside the [[Human skull|skull]].

It is produced in the [[choroid plexus]].
 
==Circulation==
[[File:NPH MRI 272 GILD.gif|thumb|MRI showing pulsation of CSF]]
CSF is produced in the brain by modified [[ependymal cells]] in the [[choroid plexus]] (approx. 50-70%), and the remainder is formed around blood vessels and along ventricular walls.
It circulates from the [[lateral ventricles]] to the [[foramen of Monro]] (Interventricular foramen), [[third ventricle]], [[aqueduct of Sylvius]] (Cerebral aqueduct), [[fourth ventricle]], [[foramina of Magendie]] (Median aperture) and [[Lateral aperture|foramina of Luschka]] (Lateral apertures); [[subarachnoid space]] over brain and spinal cord; reabsorption into venous sinus blood via arachnoid granulations.

It had been thought that CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the [[dural venous sinuses]] via the [[arachnoid granulation]]s (or villi). However, some&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14636163&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zakharov A, Papaiconomou C, Djenic J, Midha R, Johnston M |title=Lymphatic CSF absorption pathways in neonatal sheep revealed by [[sub arachnoid]] injection of Microfil |journal=Neuropathol.

The flow of CSF to the nasal [[submucosal]] [[Lymph|lymphatic channels]] through the [[cribriform plate]] seems to be specially important.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15624320&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnston M |title=The importance of lymphatics in cerebrospinal fluid transport. |journal=Lymphat.

The CSF  is produced at a rate of 500 ml/day. Since the brain can contain only 135 to 150 ml, large amounts are drained primarily into the blood through [[arachnoid granulations]] in the [[superior sagittal sinus]]. Thus the CSF turns over about 3.7 times a day.&lt;!-- &lt;reference Ganong&gt; --&gt; This continuous flow into the [[venous system]] dilutes the concentration of larger, lipoinsoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10027064&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saunders NR, Habgood MD, Dziegielewska KM |title=Barrier mechanisms in the brain, I.

CSF pressure ranges from 80 to 100 [[centimetre of water|mmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (780–980&amp;nbsp;Pa or 4.4–7.3&amp;nbsp;mmHg) in newborns, and &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 (1.94&amp;nbsp;kPa) in normal children and adults, with most variations due to coughing or internal compression of [[jugular vein]]s in the neck.

There are quantitative differences in the distributions of a number of proteins in the CSF. In general, globular proteins and albumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or cisternal fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merril CR, Goldman D, Sedman SA, Ebert MH |title=Ultrasensitive stain for proteins in polyacrylamide gels shows regional variation in cerebrospinal fluid proteins |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue= 4489|pages=1437–8 |year=1981 |month=March |pmid=6162199 |doi= 10.1126/science.6162199|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
CSF serves four primary purposes:

#Buoyancy: The actual [[mass]] of the [[human brain]] is about 1400&amp;nbsp;grams; however, the net [[weight]] of the brain suspended in the CSF is equivalent to a [[mass]] of 25&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;

#Protection: CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit. In certain situations such as [[auto accidents]] or [[sports]] injuries, the CSF cannot protect the [[Human brain|brain]] from forced contact with the [[Human skull|skull]] case, causing [[hemorrhaging]], [[brain damage]], and sometimes [[death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saladin 2007 520&quot;&gt;{{cite book

#Chemical stability: CSF flows throughout the inner [[ventricular system]] in the brain and is absorbed back into the bloodstream, rinsing the [[metabolic waste]] from the [[central nervous system]] through the [[blood-brain barrier]]. This allows for homeostatic regulation of the distribution of [[neuroendocrine]] factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high [[glycine]] [[concentration]] disrupts [[temperature]] and [[blood pressure]] control, and high CSF [[pH]] causes [[dizziness]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saladin 2007 520&quot;/&gt;
#Prevention of brain [[ischemia]]: The prevention of brain [[ischemia]] is made by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the [[Human skull|skull]]. This decreases total [[intracranial pressure]] and facilitates [[blood]] [[perfusion]].

==Pathology and laboratory diagnosis==
[[Image:CSFposter1p.png|thumb|right|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at glance.]]
When CSF pressure is elevated, [[cerebral blood flow]] may be constricted. When disorders of CSF flow occur, they may therefore affect not only CSF movement but also craniospinal compliance and the intracranial blood flow, with subsequent neuronal and glial vulnerabilities. The venous system is also important in this equation. Infants and patients shunted as small children may have particularly unexpected relationships between pressure and ventricular size, possibly due in part to venous pressure dynamics. This may have significant treatment implications, but the underlying pathophysiology needs to be further explored.   

CSF connections with the [[lymphatic system]] have been demonstrated in several [[mammal]]ian systems. Preliminary data suggest that these CSF-lymph connections form around the time that the CSF secretory capacity of the [[choroid plexus]] is developing (in [[uterus|utero]]). There may be some relationship between CSF disorders, including [[hydrocephalus]] and impaired CSF lymphatic transport.

CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of [[neurological disease]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14524396&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seehusen DA, Reeves MM, Fomin DA |title=CSF analysis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=1103–8 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14524396 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030915/1103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually obtained by a procedure called [[lumbar puncture]]. Removal of CSF during lumbar puncture can cause a severe headache after the fluid is removed, because the brain hangs on the vessels and nerve roots, and traction on them stimulates pain fibers. The pain can be relieved by intrathecal injection of sterile isotonic saline. Lumbar puncture is performed in an attempt to count the cells in the fluid and to detect the levels of protein and glucose. These parameters alone may be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] and [[central nervous system]] infections (such as [[meningitis]]). Moreover, a CSF [[Microbiological culture|culture]] examination may yield the [[microorganism]] that has caused the infection. By using more sophisticated methods, such as the detection of the [[oligoclonal bands]], an ongoing inflammatory condition (for example, [[multiple sclerosis]]) can be recognized. A [[beta-2 transferrin]] assay is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for, e.g., CSF leakage.

==Lumbar puncture==
[[Lumbar puncture]] can also be performed to measure the [[intracranial pressure]], which might be increased in certain types of [[hydrocephalus]]. However a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected because it could lead to [[brain herniation]] and ultimately death.

==Baricity==
This fluid has an importance in anesthesiology.  [[Baricity]] refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebral spinal fluid. Baricity is used in [[anesthesia]] to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the [[intrathecal]] space.

==Alzheimer's disease==
A 2010 study showed analysis of CSF for three protein biomarkers can indicate the presence of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The three biomarkers are CSF amyloid beta 1-42, total CSF tau protein and P-Tau&lt;sub&gt;181P&lt;/sub&gt;. In the study, the biomarker test showed good [[specificity and sensitivity|sensitivity]], identifying 90% of persons with Alzeheimer's disease, but poor [[specificity and sensitivity|specificity]], as 36% of control subjects were positive for the biomarkers. The researchers suggested the low specificity may be explained by developing but not yet symptomatic disease in controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Diagnosis-Independent Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Signature in Cognitively Normal Elderly People |url= http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/67/8/949 |journal= Archive of Neurology  |last= De Meyer |first= Geert |coauthors= ''et al.'' |date= August 2010 |pages= 949–56 |volume= 67 |pmid= 20697045 |issue= 8 |doi= 10.1001/archneurol.2010.179 |accessdate= 2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sharpen That Needle (editorial) |url= http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/67/8/918 |last= Herskovits |first= A.

'''Charles Francis Hockett''' (January 17, 1916 – November 3, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] [[linguist]] who developed many influential ideas in American [[structuralism#Structuralism in linguistics|structuralist]] linguistics. He represents the post-[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] phase of [[structuralism]] often referred to as &quot;distributionalism&quot; or &quot;taxonomic structuralism&quot;. His academic career spanned over half a century at Cornell and Rice universities.

==Professional and academic career==
===Education===
At the age of 16, Hockett enrolled at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] in [[ancient history]]. While enrolled at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Hockett became interested in the work of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], a leading figure in the field of [[structural linguistics]]. Hockett continued his education at [[Yale University]] where he studied [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] and received his [[doctor of philosophy|PhD]] in anthropology in 1939. While studying at Yale, Hockett studied with several other influential linguists such as [[Edward Sapir]], [[George P. Murdock]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]]. Hockett's dissertation was based on his fieldwork in [[Potawatomi]]; his paper on Potawatomi [[syntax]] was published in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'' in 1939. In 1948 his [[dissertation]] was published as a series in the [[International Journal of American Linguistics]]. Following fieldwork in [[Kickapoo language|Kickapoo]] and [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]], Hockett did two years of [[postdoctoral]] study with [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Michigan]].

===Career===
Hockett began his teaching career in 1946 as an assistant professor of linguistics in the Division of [[Modern Languages]] at [[Cornell University]] where he was responsible for directing the [[Chinese language]] program. In 1957, Hockett became a member of Cornell's anthropology department and continued to teach anthropology and linguistics until he retired to [[emeritus|emeritus status]] in 1982. In 1986, he took up an adjunct post at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where he remained active until his death in 2000.

===Achievements===
Charles Hockett held membership among many academic institutions such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]]. He served as president of both the [[Linguistic Society of America]] and the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States.

In addition to making many contributions to the field of [[structural linguistics]], Hockett also considered such things as [[Benjamin Whorf|Whorfian Theory]], [[jokes]], the nature of [[writing systems]], slips of the tongue, and [[animal communication]] and their relativeness to [[speech]].

Outside the realm of linguistics and anthropology, Hockett practiced [[Musical theatre|musical]] performance and [[Musical composition|composition]]. Hockett composed a full-length [[opera]] called ''The Love of Doña Rosita'' which was based on a play by [[Federico García Lorca]] and premiered at [[Ithaca College]] by the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] [[Opera]].

Hockett and his wife Shirley were vital leaders in the development of the [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]] Chamber Orchestra in Ithaca, New York. In appreciation of the Hocketts' hard work and dedication to the Ithaca community, Ithaca College established the Charles F. Hockett Music Scholarship, the Shirley and Chas Hockett Chamber Music Concert Series, and the Hockett Family Recital Hall.

==View on linguistics==
In his &quot;Note on Structure&quot; he argues that [[linguistics]] can be seen as a game and as a science. A linguist as player has a freedom for experimentation on all the utterances of a language, but no criterion to compare his analysis with other linguists. Late in his career, he was known for his stinging criticism of Chomskyan linguistics.

==Key contributions==
===Comparative method of linguistics===

One of Hockett’s most important contributions was his development of the [[Design Features of Language|design-feature]] approach to comparative linguistics where he attempted to distinguish the similarities and differences among [[animal communication]] systems and [[human language]]. 

Hockett initially developed seven features which were published in the 1959 paper “Animal ‘Languages’ and Human Language.” However, after many revisions, he settled on 13 design-features which can be found in the [[Scientific American]] article “The Origin of Speech.” 

Hockett argued that while every communication system has some of the 13 design features, only human, spoken language has all 13 features. In turn, this differentiates human spoken language from animal communication and other human communication systems such as [[written language]].

===Hockett's 13 design features of language===
#[[Vocal-Auditory Channel]]: Much of human language is performed using the [[vocal]] tract and [[auditory system|auditory]] channel. Hockett viewed this as an advantage for human [[primates]] because it allowed for the ability to participate in other activities while simultaneously communicating through spoken language.
#[[Broadcast transmission and directional reception]]: All human language can be heard if it is within range of another person’s auditory channel. Additionally, a listener has the ability to determine the source of a sound by [[binaural direction]] finding.
#[[Rapid Fading (transitoriness)]]: Wave forms of human language dissipate over time and do not persist. A hearer can only receive specific auditory information at the time it is spoken.
#[[Interchangeability]]: A person has the ability to both speak and hear the same [[Signalling theory|signal]]. Anything that a person is able to hear, they have the ability to reproduce through spoken language.
#[[Total Feedback]]: A speaker has the ability to hear themselves speak. Through this, they are able to monitor their [[speech production]] and internalize what they are producing through language.
#Specialization: Human language sounds are specialized for communication. When dogs pant it is to cool themselves off, when humans speak it is to transmit information.
#[[Semanticity]]: This refers to the idea that specific signals can be matched with a specific [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].
#[[Arbitrariness]]: There is no limitation to what can be communicated about and there is no specific or necessary connection between the sounds used and the message being sent.
#[[Discrete mathematics|Discreteness]]: [[Phonemes]] can be placed in distinct categories which differentiate them from one another , such as the distinct sound of /p/ versus /b/.
#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: The ability to refer to things in space and time and communicate about things that are currently not present.
#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: The ability to create new and unique meanings of utterances from previously existing utterances and sounds.
#[[Traditional Transmission]]: The idea that human language is not completely [[innate]] and acquisition depends in part on the learning of a language.
#[[Duality of patterning]]: Meaningless phonic segments ([[phoneme]]s) are combined to make meaningful words, which in turn are combined again to make sentences.

While Hockett believed that all communication systems, animal and human alike, share many of these features, only human language contains all of the 13 design features. Additionally, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]] are key to human language.

====Hockett's design features and their implications for human language====
#Hockett suggests that the importance of a vocal-auditory channel lies in the fact that the animal can communicate while also performing other tasks, such as eating, or using tools.
#[[Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception]]: An auditory|audible human language signal is sent out in all directions, but is perceived in a limited direction. For example, humans are more proficient in determining the location of a sound source when the sound is projecting directly in front of them as opposed to a sound source projected directly behind them.
#[[Rapid Fading]] of a signal in human communication differs from such things as animal tracks and written language because an utterance does not continue to exist after it has been broadcast. With this in mind, it is important to note that Hockett viewed spoken language as the primary concern for investigation. Written language was seen as being secondary due to its recent evolution in culture.
#[[Interchangeability]] represents a human's ability to act out or reproduce any linguistic message that they are able to comprehend. This differs from many animal communication systems, particularly in regards to mating. For example, humans have the ability to say and do anything that they feel may benefit them in attracting a mate. [[Stickleback]]s on the other hand have different male and female courtship motions; a male cannot replicate a female's motions and vice versa.
#[[Total Feedback]] is important in differentiating a human's ability to internalize their own productions of speech and behavior. This design-feature incorporates the idea that humans have insight into their actions.
#Specialization is apparent in the anatomy of human [[speech organs]] and our ability to exhibit some control over these organs. For example, a key assumption in the evolution of language is that the descent of the [[larynx]] has allowed humans to produce speech sounds. Additionally, in terms of control, humans are generally able to control the movements of their tongue and mouth. Dogs however, do not have control over these organs. When dogs pant they are communicating a signal, but the panting is an uncontrollable response reflex of being hot [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/psychology/rmk/Readings/Hockett.pdf].
#[[Semanticity]]: A specific signal can be matched with a specific meaning within a particular language system. For example, all people that understand [[English language|English]] have the ability to make a connection between a specific word and what that word represents or refers to. (Hockett notes that [[gibbon]]s also show semanticity in their signals, however their calls are far more broad than human language.)
#[[Arbitrariness]] within human language suggests that there is no direct connection between the type of signal (word) and what is being referenced. For example, an animal as large as a cow can be referred to by a very short word [http://web.archive.org/web/20091027014002/http://www.geocities.com/pkd_du/dfhl.htm ].
#[[Discrete mathematics|Discreteness]]: Each basic unit of speech can be categorized and is distinct from other categories. In human language there are only a small set of sound ranges that are used and the differences between these bits of sound are absolute. In contrast, the [[waggle dance]] of [[honeybees]] is continuous.
#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]] refers to the human language system's ability to communicate about things that are not present spatially, temporally, or realistically. For example, humans have the ability to communicate about unicorns and outer space.
#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: human language is open and productive in the sense that humans have the ability to say things that have never before been spoken or heard. In contrast, apes such as the gibbon have a closed communication system because all of their vocal sounds are part of a finite repertoire of familiar calls.
#[[Traditional Transmission]]:: suggests that while certain aspects of [[language]] may be [[innate]], [[human]]s acquire words and their [[native language]] from other speakers. This is different from many [[animal communication]] systems because most animals are born with the [[innate]] [[knowledge]] and [[skills]] necessary for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]]. (Example: [[Honeybees]] have an inborn ability to perform and understand the [[waggle dance]]).
#[[Duality of patterning]]: Humans have the ability to recombine a finite set of [[phoneme]]s to create an infinite number of words, which in turn can be combined to make an unlimited number of different sentences.

====Design feature representation in other communication systems====
;Honeybees

Foraging [[honeybees]] communicate with other members of their hive when they have discovered a relevant source of [[pollen]], [[nectar]], or water. In an effort to convey information about the location and distance of such resources, honeybees participate in a particular figure-eight dance known as the [[waggle dance]].

In [[Charles Hockett]]'s &quot;The Origin of Speech,&quot; Hockett determined that the honeybee communication system of the [[waggle dance]] holds the following [[Design Features of Language|design features]]:

#Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception – Through the use of this dance, honeybees are able to send out a signal that informs other members of the hive as to what direction the source of food, or water can be located.
#[[Semanticity]] – Evidence that the specific signals of a communication system can be matched with specific meanings is apparent because other members of the hive are able to locate the food source after a performance of the waggle dance.
#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]] – Demonstrated in the foraging honeybees' ability to communicate about a resource that is not currently present within the hive.
#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]] – [[waggle dance]]s change based on the direction, amount, and type of resource.

;Gibbons

[[Gibbon]]s are small apes in the family Hylobatidae. While gibbons share the same [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[Class (biology)|class]], and [[Order (biology)|order]] of humans and are relatively close to man, Hockett distinguishes between the Gibbon communication system and human language by noting that gibbons are devoid of the last four design features.

Gibbons possess the first nine [[Design Features of Language|design features]], but do not possess the last four (displacement, productivity, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]]).

#Displacement, according to Hockett, appears to be lacking in the vocal [[Signalling theory|signal]]ing of apes.
#Productivity does not exist among Gibbons because if any vocal sound is produced, it is one of a finite set of repetitive and familiar calls.
#Hockett supports the idea that humans learn language extra genetically through the process of [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]. Hockett distinguishes Gibbons from humans by stating that despite any similarities in communication among a species of apes, one cannot attribute these similarities to acquisition through the teaching and learning ([[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]) of signals; the only explanation must be a genetic basis.
#Finally, [[duality of patterning]] explains a human's ability to create multiple [[meanings (linguistics)|meanings]] from somewhat meaningless sounds. For example, the [[phonemes|sound]]s /t/, /a/, /c/ can be used to create the words &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;tack&quot;, and &quot;act&quot;. Hockett states that no other [[Hominoid]] communication system besides human language maintains this ability.

===Later additions to the features===

In a report published in 1968 with anthropologist and scientist Stuart A. Altmann, Hockett derived three more [[Design Features of Language|Design Features]], bringing the total to 16. The additional three are:

#&lt;li value=14&gt; '''[[Prevarication]]''' – a speaker can say falsehoods, lies, and meaningless statements.
# '''Reflexiveness''' – Language can be used communicate about the very system it is; i.e. language can discuss language
# '''[[Learnability]]''' – a speaker of a language can learn another language

====Other additions====

Cognitive scientist and linguist at the University of Sussex [[Larry Trask]] (1944–2004) offered an alternative term and definition for number 14, '''[[Prevarication]]''':
:14. (a) '''Stimulus Freedom''' – we can choose to say anything we want or say nothing at all in any given situation

There has since been one more Feature added to the list, by [http://www.bsos.umd.edu/anth/People/FacStaff/faculty/wstuart/index.html Dr. William Taft Stuart], a director of the Undergraduate Studies program at the University of Maryland: College Park’s Anthropology school, part of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. His “extra” Feature is:

:17. '''Grammaticality''' – a speaker’s sayings conform to the rules of grammar

This follows the definition of Grammar and Syntax, as given by Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary:

:'''[[Grammar]]''':
::1. (a) the study of the classes of words, their inflections, and their functions and relations in the sentence (b) a study of what is to be preferred and what avoided in inflection and syntax

::2. (a) the characteristic system of inflections and syntax of a language (b) a system of rules that defines the grammatical structure of a language

:'''[[Syntax]]''':
::1. (a) the way in which linguistic elements (as words) are put together to form constituents (as phrases or clauses) (b) the part of grammar

====Relationship between the design features and animal communication====

Additionally, Dr. Stuart defends his postulation with references to famous linguist Noam Chomsky and University of New York psychologist Gary Marcus. Chomsky theorized that humans are unique in the animal world because of their ability to utilize Design Feature 5: Total Feedback, or recursive grammar. This includes being able to correct oneself and insert explanatory or even non sequitur statements into a sentence, without breaking stride, and keeping proper grammar throughout.

While there have been studies attempting to disprove Chomsky, Marcus states that, &quot;An intriguing possibility is that the capacity to recognize recursion might be found only in species that can acquire new patterns of vocalization, for example, songbirds, humans and perhaps some cetaceans.&quot; This is in response to a [http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2006/04/26/birds-grammar060426.html study performed] by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentner’s study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify “odd” statements within a given “song.” However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomsky’s observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns.

[http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~johnson/articles.chimp.html There is also thought] that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding “humans” would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us, 
today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|[[Edward O. Wilson]]'s 1998 book|Consilience (book)}}
{{No footnotes|date=February 2009}}
'''Consilience''', or the unity of knowledge (literally a &quot;jumping together&quot; of knowledge), has its roots in the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek concept]] of an [[intrinsic]] orderliness that governs our [[cosmos]], inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with [[mystical]] views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The [[Rationality|rational]] view was recovered during the high [[Middle Ages]], separated from [[theology]] during the [[Renaissance]] and found its apogee in the Age of [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Then, with the rise of the [[modern science]]s, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries.

==Modern usage==
The word ''consilience'' was apparently coined by [[William Whewell]], in ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,''  1840.  In this synthesis Whewell explained that, &quot;The Consilience of Inductions takes place when an [[inductive reasoning|Induction]], obtained from one class of facts, coincides with an Induction obtained from another different class.  Thus Consilience is a test of the truth of the Theory in which it occurs.&quot;

Modern views understand that each branch of knowledge studies a subset of reality that depends on factors studied in other branches. [[Atomic physics]] underlies the workings of [[chemistry]], which studies [[emergence|emergent]] properties that in turn are the basis of [[biology]]. [[Psychology]] can no longer be separated from the study of properties emergent from the interaction of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s. [[Sociology]], [[economics]], and [[anthropology]] are each, in turn, studies of properties emergent from the interaction of countless individual humans.

The fact that all these different areas of research are studying one real, existing universe is an apparent explanation of why generalizations arrived at in one area have often helped in understanding other areas.  Consilience is thus often used as an argument for [[scientific realism]] by philosophers of science.

==Edward O. Wilson==
Although the concept of consilience in Whewell's sense was widely discussed by philosophers of science, the term was unfamiliar to the broader public until the end of the 20th century, when it was vividly revived in ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]],'' a 1998 book by the humanist biologist [[Edward Osborne Wilson]], as an attempt to bridge the culture gap between the sciences and the humanities that was the subject of [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'' (1959).  Wilson's assertion was that the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give a purpose to understanding the details, to lend to all inquirers &quot;a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws.&quot; Wilson's concept is a much broader notion of consilience than that of Whewell, who was merely pointing out that generalizations invented to account for one set of phenomena often account for others as well.

A parallel view lies in the term [[universology]], which literally means &quot;the science of the universe.&quot; Universology was first advocated for the study of the interconnecting principles and truths of all domains of knowledge by [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a 19th century utopian futurist and anarchist.

==Election methods==
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
The word ''consilience'' has been adapted to refer to a specific process of ''checks and balances'' in election methods that satisfy the following conditions:  (1) At least two different ballot tabulation methods shall be relied upon to achieve the ''official election tally''; (2) Each tabulation method employed shall have separate and distinct oversight; (3) Neither tabulation method, nor its oversight and personnel involved, shall communicate with one another during this checking process to prevent cheating; (4) Tallies derived from each ballot method must agree within a margin of discrepancy that would not overturn the outcome of the election; (5) There must be physical paper evidence of the ballots, i.e., at least one of the two methods employed must rely on hand-counted paper ballots or hand-counted ''voter verified paper trails;'' (6) At least two of the tabulation methods must occur at the location where the votes are cast, e.g. the precinct, the poll site; and (7) The process shall commence immediately upon the close of polls and preferably shall conclude without severing the chain of custody of the participants conducting the process.

If ''consilience'' is not achieved upon the first exercise of the election's checks and balances process described above (i.e., the margin of discrepancy of the ballot tallies do not agree), then an investigation including more tabulation shall immediately ensue.

Commonly, ''consilience'' refers to two full hand count tabulation methods if they are achieved by separate and distinct oversight that do not communicate; but, for example, in races surpassing 400,000 ballots cast (to ensure 99% statistical accuracy), it can also mean the concordance of tallies from a 10% sample of paper ballots randomly selected from each and every voting site when compared with the tallies from optiscan-type electronic voting machines.

'''Clarence Brown''' (May 10, 1890 &amp;ndash; August 17, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[film director]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], to a cotton manufacturer, Brown moved to the South when he was 11. He attended [[Knoxville High School (Tennessee)|Knoxville High School]]&lt;ref&gt;John Shearer, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/may/28/052810knoxhighbox2/ Famous alumni from Knoxville High School], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', May 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Tennessee]], both in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], graduating from the university at the age of 19 with two degrees in [[engineering]]. An early fascination in automobiles led Brown to a job with the [[Stevens-Duryea]] Company, then to his own Brown Motor Car Company in [[Alabama]]. He later abandoned the car dealership after developing an interest in motion pictures around 1913. He was hired by the Peerless Studio at [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], and became an assistant to the great French-born director [[Maurice Tourneur]].

==Career==
After serving in [[World War I]], Brown was given his first co-directing credit (with Tourneur) for 1920s ''The Great Redeemer''. Later that year, he directed a major portion of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1920 American film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' after Tourneur was injured in a fall.

Brown moved to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] in 1924, and then to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], where he stayed until the mid-1950s. At MGM he was one of the main directors of their female stars&amp;ndash;he directed both [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Greta Garbo]] six times. Garbo referred to Brown as her favorite director.

He not only made the difficult transition from silent cinema to sound cinema, but thrived there, proving himself to be a &quot;actor's director&quot;: listening to his actors', respecting their instincts, and often incorporating their suggestions into scenes. In doing so, Brown created believable, under-played, naturalistic dialogue scenes stripped of melodrama, pulsing with the honest rhythms of real-life conversation. He was nominated five times (see below) for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as a director, and once as a producer, but never received an Oscar. However, he did win Best Foreign Film for ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' at the 1935 [[Venice International Film Festival]].

Brown's films gained a total of 38 Academy Award nominations and earned nine Oscars. Brown himself received six Academy Award nominations and in 1949 won the British Academy Award for the film version of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Intruder in the Dust (1949 film)|Intruder in the Dust]].

Brown retired a wealthy man due to his real estate investments, but refused to watch new movies, as he feared they might cause him to restart his career. In the 1970s, Brown became a much-sought guest lecturer on the film-festival circuit, thanks in part to his connection with Garbo.

The [http://www.clarencebrowntheatre.com/ Clarence Brown Theater], on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], is named in his honor.

He is tied with [[Robert Altman]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] for the most director nominations without a single win.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conciliation''' is an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) process whereby the parties to a dispute (including future interest disputes) agree to utilize the services of a conciliator, who then meets with the parties separately in an attempt to resolve their differences. They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, providing technical assistance, exploring potential solutions and bringing about a negotiated settlement. 

Conciliation differs from [[arbitration]] in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award. 

Conciliation differs from [[mediation]] in that the main goal is to conciliate, most of the time by seeking concessions. In mediation, the mediator tries to guide the discussion in a way that optimizes parties needs, takes feelings into account and reframes representations. 

In conciliation the parties seldom, if ever, actually face each other across the table in the presence of the conciliator.

==Effectiveness==

Recent studies in the processes of [[negotiation]] have indicated the effectiveness of a technique that deserves mention here. A conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation). The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important. He/She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to &quot;give&quot; on the objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn. The parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives, and usually have some objectives that are not listed by the other party. Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.

Most successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators. Some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities, and for governmental agencies such as the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (United States)|Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]] in the [[United States]].

==Historical Conciliation==
Historical conciliation is an applied conflict resolution approach that utilizes historical [[narratives]] to positively transform relations between societies in conflicts. Historical conciliation can utilize many different methodologies, including [[mediation]], [[Sustained Dialogue|sustained dialogue]], apologies, acknowledgement, support of public commemoration activities, and public diplomacy. 

Historical Conciliation is not an excavation of objective facts. The point of facilitating historical questions is not to discover all the facts in regard to who was right or wrong. Rather, the objective is to discover the complexity, ambiguity, and emotions surrounding both dominant and non-dominant cultural and individual narratives of history. It is also not a rewriting of history. The goal is not to create a combined narrative that everyone agrees upon. Instead, the aim is to create room for critical thinking and more inclusive understanding of the past and conceptions of “the other.”

Conflicts that are addressed through historical conciliation have their roots in conflicting [[identity|identities]] of the people involved. Whether the identity at stake is their ethnicity, religion or culture, it requires a comprehensive approach that takes people’s needs, hopes, fears, and concerns into account.

==Conciliation in Japan==

[[Japan]]ese law makes extensive use of {{nihongo|conciliation|調停|chōtei}} in civil disputes. The most common forms are civil conciliation and domestic conciliation, both of which are managed under the auspices of the court system by one judge and two non-judge &quot;conciliators.&quot;

Civil conciliation is a form of dispute resolution for small lawsuits, and provides a simpler and cheaper alternative to litigation. Depending on the nature of the case, non-judge experts (doctors, appraisers, actuaries, and so on) may be called by the court as conciliators to help decide the case.

Domestic conciliation is most commonly used to handle contentious [[divorce]]s, but may apply to other domestic disputes such as the annulment of a marriage or acknowledgment of paternity. Parties in such cases are required to undergo conciliation proceedings and may only bring their case to court once conciliation has failed.

The '''Cyclone''' [[programming language]] is intended to be a safe dialect of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]. Cyclone is designed to avoid [[buffer overflow]]s and other vulnerabilities that are endemic in C programs, without losing the power and convenience of C as a tool for [[system programming]].

Cyclone development was started as a joint project of AT&amp;T Labs Research and [[Greg Morrisett]]'s group at Cornell in 2001. Version 1.0 was released on May 8, 2006.

==Language features==
Cyclone attempts to avoid some of the common pitfalls of [[C (programming language)|C]], while still maintaining its look and performance. To this end, Cyclone places the following limits on programs:
* &lt;code&gt;[[NULL]]&lt;/code&gt; checks are inserted to prevent [[segmentation fault]]s
* [[Pointer arithmetic]] is limited
* Pointers must be initialized before use (this is enforced by [[definite assignment analysis]])
* [[Dangling pointer]]s are prevented through region analysis and limits on [[Malloc|&lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt;]]
* Only &quot;safe&quot; casts and unions are allowed
* [[Control flow|&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;]] into scopes is disallowed
* [[Control flow|&lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;]] labels in different scopes are disallowed
* Pointer-returning functions must execute &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Setjmp/longjmp|&lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt;]] and [[Setjmp/longjmp|&lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;]] are not supported

To maintain the tool set that C programmers are used to, Cyclone provides the following extensions:
* '''Never-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointers''' do not require &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks
* '''&quot;Fat&quot; pointers''' support pointer arithmetic with run-time [[bounds checking]]
* '''Growable regions''' support a form of safe manual memory management
* '''[[Garbage collection (computer science)|Garbage collection]]''' for heap-allocated values
* '''[[Tagged union]]s''' support type-varying arguments
* '''Injections''' help automate the use of tagged unions for programmers
* '''[[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]''' replaces some uses of [[void pointer|&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;]]
* '''varargs''' are implemented as fat pointers
* '''[[Exception handling|Exceptions]]''' replace some uses of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;

For a better high-level introduction to Cyclone, the reasoning behind Cyclone and the source of these lists, see [http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/cyclone/papers/cyclone-safety.pdf this paper].

Cyclone looks, in general, much like [[C (programming language)|C]], but it should be viewed as a C-like language.

===Pointer/reference types===
Cyclone implements three kinds of [[reference (computer science)|reference]] (following C terminology these are called pointers):
* &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (the normal type)
* &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; (the never-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer), and
* &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; (the only type with [[pointer arithmetic]] allowed, &quot;fat&quot; pointers).
The purpose of introducing these new pointer types is to avoid common problems when using pointers. Take for instance a function, called &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; that takes a pointer to an int:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int foo(int *);
&lt;/source&gt;
Although the person who wrote the function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; could have inserted &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks, let us assume that for performance reasons they did not. Calling &lt;code&gt;foo(NULL);&lt;/code&gt; will result in [[undefined behavior]] (typically, although not necessarily, a '''SIGSEGV''' being sent to the application). To avoid such problems, Cyclone introduces the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; pointer type, which can never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the &quot;safe&quot; version of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int foo(int @);
&lt;/source&gt;
This tells the Cyclone compiler that the argument to &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; should never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, avoiding the aforementioned undefined behavior. The simple change of &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; saves the programmer from having to write &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks and the operating system from having to trap &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer dereferences.  This extra limit, however, can be a rather large stumbling block for most C programmers, who are used to being able to manipulate their pointers directly with arithmetic. Although this is desirable, it can lead to [[buffer overflow]]s and other &quot;off-by-one&quot;-style mistakes. To avoid this, the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; pointer type is delimited by a known bound, the size of the array. Although this adds overhead due to the extra information stored about the pointer, it improves safety and security. Take for instance a simple (and naïve) &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; function, written in C:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int strlen(const char *s)
 {
     int iter = 0;
     if (s == NULL) return 0;
     while (s[iter] != '\0') {
        iter++;
     }
     return iter;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
This function assumes that the string being passed in is terminated by NUL (&lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt;). However, what would happen if &lt;code&gt;char&amp;nbsp;buf[]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{'h','e','l','l','o','!'};&lt;/code&gt; were passed to this string? This is perfectly legal in C, yet would cause &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; to iterate through memory not necessarily associated with the string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. There are functions, such as &lt;code&gt;strnlen&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to avoid such problems, but these functions are not standard with every implementation of [[ANSI C]]. The Cyclone version of &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; is not so different from the C version:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int strlen(const char ? s)
 {
    int iter, n = s.size;
    if (s == NULL) return 0;
    for (iter = 0; iter &lt; n; iter++, s++) {
       if (*s == '\0') return iter;
    }
    return n;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; bounds itself by the length of the array passed to it, thus not going over the actual length. Each of the kinds of pointer type can be safely cast to each of the others, and arrays and strings are automatically cast to &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; by the compiler. (Casting from &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; invokes a [[bounds checking|bounds check]], and casting from &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; invokes both a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; check and a bounds check. Casting from &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; results in no checks whatsoever; the resulting &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; pointer has a size of 1.)

===Dangling pointers and region analysis===
Consider the following code, in C:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 char *itoa(int i)
 {
    char buf[20];
    sprintf(buf,&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    return buf;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
This returns an object that is allocated on the stack of the function &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, which is not available after the function returns. While [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] and other compilers will warn about such code, the following will typically compile without warnings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 char *itoa(int i)
 {
    char buf[20], *z;
    sprintf(buf,&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    z = buf;
    return z;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
Cyclone does regional analysis of each segment of code, preventing dangling pointers, such as the one returned from this version of &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;. All of the local variables in a given scope are considered to be part of the same region, separate from the heap or any other local region. Thus, when analyzing &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler would see that &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer into the local stack, and would report an error.

===Manual memory management===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

== Examples ==
The best example to start with is the classic [[Hello world]] program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;core.h&gt;
 using Core;
 int main(int argc, string_t ? args)
 {
    if (argc &lt;= 1) {
       printf(&quot;Usage: hello-cyclone &lt;name&gt;\n&quot;);
       return 1;
    }
    printf(&quot;Hello from Cyclone, %s\n&quot;, args[1]);
    return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the term counter used in electronics and computing}}

In [[digital logic]] and [[computing]], a '''counter''' is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular [[event (philosophy)|event]] or [[Process (computing)|process]] has occurred, often in relationship to a [[clock signal]].

== Electronic counters ==
In [[electronics]], counters can be implemented quite easily using register-type circuits such as the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], and a wide variety of classifications exist:

* Asynchronous (ripple) counter – changing state bits are used as clocks to subsequent state flip-flops
* Synchronous counter – all state bits change under control of a single clock
* Decade counter – counts through ten states per stage
* Up/down counter – counts both up and down, under command of a control input
* Ring counter – formed by a shift register with feedback connection in a ring
* Johnson counter – a ''twisted'' ring counter
* Cascaded counter

Each is useful for different applications. Usually, counter circuits are [[digital]] in nature, and count in [[binary numeral system|natural binary]]. Many types of counter circuits are available as digital building blocks, for example a number of chips in the [[4000 series]] implement different counters.

Occasionally there are advantages to using a counting sequence other than the natural binary sequence—such as the [[binary coded decimal]] counter, a [[linear feedback shift register#Uses as counters|linear feedback shift register]] counter, or a [[Gray Code#Gray code counters and arithmetic|Gray-code]] counter.

Counters are useful for digital clocks and timers, and in oven timers, VCR clocks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/synchronous_counter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asynchronous (ripple) counter ===
[[File:Asynchronous-counter2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Asynchronous counter created from two [[JK flip-flop]]s]]

An asynchronous (ripple) counter is a single [[Flip-flop (electronics)#J flip-flop|K-type flip-flop]], with its J (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows (starts over from 0). This counter will increment once for every clock cycle and takes two clock cycles to overflow, so every cycle it will alternate between a transition from 0 to 1 and a transition from 1 to 0. Notice that this creates a new clock with a 50% [[duty cycle]] at exactly half the frequency of the input clock. If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged D flip-flop (remembering to invert the output to the input), you will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast. Putting them together yields a two-bit counter:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Cycle !! Q1 !! Q0 !! (Q1:Q0)dec
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1  || 1
|-
| 2 || 1 || 0  || 2
|-
| 3 || 1 || 1  || 3
|-
| 4 || 0 || 0  || 0
|}

You can continue to add additional flip-flops, always inverting the output to its own input, and using the output from the previous flip-flop as the clock signal. The result is called a ripple counter, which can count to 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-1 where n is the number of bits (flip-flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows &quot;ripple&quot; from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division [[ratio]] overall is (to clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit; the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).

The use of flip-flop outputs as clocks leads to timing skew between the count data bits, making this ripple technique incompatible with normal [[synchronous circuit]] design styles.

=== Synchronous counter ===
[[File:4-bit-jk-flip-flop V1.1.svg|thumb|400px|right|A 4-bit synchronous counter using JK flip-flops]]

A simple way of implementing the logic for each bit of an ascending counter (which is what is depicted in the image to the right) is for each bit to toggle when all of the less significant bits are at a logic high state.  For example, bit 1 toggles when bit 0 is logic high; bit 2 toggles when both bit 1 and bit 0 are logic high; bit 3 toggles when bit 2, bit 1 and bit 0 are all high; and so on.

Synchronous counters can also be implemented with hardware [[finite state machine]]s, which are more complex but allow for smoother, more stable transitions.

Hardware-based counters are of this type.

=== Decade counter ===

A decade counter is one that counts in decimal digits, rather than binary.  A decade counter may have each digit binary encoded (that is, it may count in [[binary-coded decimal]], as the [[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|7490]] integrated circuit did) or other binary encodings (such as the [[Bi-quinary_coded_decimal|bi-quinary encoding]] of the [[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|7490]] integrated circuit).  Alternatively, it may have a &quot;fully decoded&quot; or [[one-hot]] output code in which each output goes high in turn (the [[4000 series#4017 decade counter|4017]] is such a circuit). The latter type of circuit finds applications in [[multiplexer]]s and demultiplexers, or wherever a scanning type of behavior is useful. Similar counters with different numbers of outputs are also common.

The decade counter is also known as a mod-counter when it counts to ten (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). A Mod Counter that counts to 64 stops at 63 because 0 counts as a valid digit.

=== Up/down counter ===

A counter that can change state in either direction, under the control of an up/down selector input, is known as an up/down counter. When the selector is in the up state, the counter increments its value. When the selector is in the down state, the counter decrements the count.

=== Ring counter ===
{{main|Ring counter}}

A ring counter is a [[shift register]] (a cascade connection of [[flip-flop]]s) with the output of the last one connected to the input of the first, that is, in a ring.  Typically, a pattern consisting of a single bit is circulated so the state repeats every n clock cycles if n flip-flops are used.It can be used as a cycle counter of n states.

=== Johnson counter ===
{{main|Ring counter}}
A Johnson counter (or switchtail ring counter, twisted-ring counter, walking-ring counter, or Moebius counter) is a modified ring counter, where the output from the last stage is inverted and fed back as input to the first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Principles Foundation of Circuit Design and Application | author = Arun Kumar Singh | publisher =  New Age Publishers | yearasdasd = 2006 | isbn = 8122417590 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=13Wi37h2A-oC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=switchtail+ring+counter+johnson&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=umTxSPXeKZH2sQP6muHZBg&amp;sig=ACfU3U29vJPSflqg7sngLSbt5OxDp6fMvQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art of Electronics | author = Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | isbn = 0521370957 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA667&amp;dq=ring+counter+walking&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=NGbxSLrfIIuoswP_oqmdBw&amp;sig=ACfU3U0nWT1AwZt_wgUnAedWxa8X6iDktw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Dictionary of Electronics | author = Rudolf F.

These counters find specialist applications, including those similar to the decade counter, digital-to-analog conversion, etc.
They can be implemented easily using D- or JK-type flip-flops.

In [[computability theory]], a '''counter''' is considered a type of memory. A counter stores a single [[natural number]] (initially [[0 (number)|zero]]) and can be arbitrarily many digits long. A counter is usually considered in conjunction with a [[finite-state machine]] (FSM), which can perform the following operations on the counter:

* Check whether the counter is zero
* Increment the counter by one
* Decrement the counter by one (if it's already zero, this leaves it unchanged).

The following machines are listed in order of power, with each one being strictly more powerful than the one below it:
# Deterministic or non-deterministic FSM plus two counters
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one [[stack (data structure)|stack]]
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic or non-deterministic FSM

For the first and last, it doesn't matter whether the FSM is a [[deterministic finite-state machine]] or a [[nondeterministic finite-state machine]]. They have equivalent power. The first two and the last one are levels of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

The first machine, an FSM plus two counters, is equivalent in power to a [[Turing machine]]. See the article on [[counter machine]]s for a proof.

[[File:CountersMechanical.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Several mechanical counters]]
Long before electronics became common, mechanical devices were used to count events. These typically consist of a series of disks mounted on an axle, with the digits 0 through 9 marked on their edge. The right most disk moves one increment with each event. Each disk except the left-most has a protrusion that, after the completion of one revolution, moves the next disk to the left one increment. Such counters were originally used  to control manufacturing processes, but were later used as [[odometer]]s for bicycles and cars and in [[fuel dispenser]]s. One of the largest manufacturers was the Veeder-Root company, and their name was often used for this type of counter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.veeder.com/page/vr_history&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clay Mathematics Institute''' ('''CMI''') is a private, [[non-profit]] [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]], based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. The Institute is dedicated to increasing and disseminating [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge. It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians. The institute was founded in 1998 through the vision and generosity of Boston businessman [[Landon T. Clay]] and his wife, Lavinia D. Clay.  [[Harvard University|Harvard]] mathematician [[Arthur Jaffe]] was the first president of CMI. 

While the institute is best known for its [[Millennium Prize Problems]], it carries out a wide range of activities, including a postdoctoral program (ten Clay Research Fellows are supported each year) and an annual summer school, the proceedings of which are published jointly with the [[American Mathematical Society]].

==Governance==
The Institute is run according to a standard structure comprising a board of directors that decides on grant-awarding and research proposals, and a scientific advisory committee that oversees and approves the board's decisions. {{As of|February 2008}}, the board is made up of members of the Clay family, whereas the advisory committee is composed of leading authorities in mathematics, namely [[Andrew Wiles|Sir Andrew Wiles]], [[Yum-Tong Siu]], [[Richard Melrose]], [[Gregory Margulis]], [[James Carlson]], and [[Simon Donaldson]].  James Carlson is the current president of CMI.

==Millennium Prize Problems==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Convolution]] --&gt;
{{Main|Millennium Prize Problems}}
The institute is best known for establishing the Millennium Prize Problems on May 24, 2000. These seven problems are considered by CMI to be &quot;important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years&quot;. For each problem, the first person to solve it will be awarded $1,000,000 by the CMI. In announcing the prize, CMI drew a parallel to [[Hilbert's problems]], which were proposed in 1900, and had a substantial impact on 20th century mathematics. Of the initial twenty-three Hilbert problems, most of which have been solved, only the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (formulated in 1859) is included in the seven Millennium Prize Problems.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jaffe's first-hand account of how this Millennium Prize came about can be read in  [http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-jaffe.pdf The Millennium Grand Challenge in Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

For each problem, the Institute had a professional mathematician write up an official statement of the problem, which will be the main standard by which a given solution will be measured against. The seven problems are:

* [[P versus NP]]
* [[Hodge conjecture|The Hodge conjecture]]
* [[Poincaré conjecture|The Poincaré conjecture]] - solved, by [[Grigori Perelman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;press-release-2010-03-18&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Clay Mathematics Institute| date=March 18, 2010 | format=PDF | title = Prize for Resolution of the Poincaré Conjecture Awarded to Dr. Grigoriy Perelman|url = http://www.claymath.org/poincare/millenniumPrizeFull.pdf | accessdate=March 18, 2010 | quote = The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) announces today that Dr. Grigoriy Perelman of St. Petersburg, Russia, is the recipient of the Millennium Prize for resolution of the Poincaré conjecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Riemann hypothesis|The Riemann hypothesis]]
* [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap]]
* [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]]
* [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture|The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]].

Some of the mathematicians who were involved in the selection and presentation of the seven problems were [[Michael Atiyah|Atiyah]], [[Bombieri]], [[Connes]], [[Deligne]], [[Fefferman]], [[Milnor]], [[David Mumford|Mumford]], [[Andrew Wiles|Wiles]], and [[Edward Witten|Witten]].

==Other awards==
===The Clay Research Award===
{{main|Clay Research Award}}
In recognition of major breakthroughs in mathematical research, the institute has an annual prize - the Clay Research Award. It recipients to date are [[Manindra Agrawal]], [[Manjul Bhargava]], [[Alain Connes]], Nils Dencker, Alex Eskin, [[Ben J. Green|Ben
Green]], [[Christopher Hacon]], [[Richard Hamilton (professor)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Michael Harris]], [[Laurent Lafforgue]], [[Ngo Bao Chau]], [[Gérard Laumon]], [[James McKernan]], [[Oded Schramm]], [[Stanislav Smirnov]], [[Terence Tao]],
[[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], [[Claire Voisin]], [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Edward Witten]].

===The Olympiad award===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The CMI also offers the Clay Olympiad Scholar Award for the most creative solution to a problem on the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad]].

==Other activities==
Besides the Millennium Prize Problems, the Clay Mathematics Institute also supports mathematics via the awarding of
research fellowships (which range from two to five years, and are aimed at younger mathematicians), as well as shorter-term
scholarships for programs, individual research, and book writing. The Institute also has a yearly [[Clay Research Award]], recognizing major breakthroughs in mathematical research. Finally, the Institute also organizes a number of summer schools, conferences, workshops, public lectures, and outreach activities aimed primarily at junior mathematicians (from the high school to postdoctoral level).
CMI publications are available in PDF form at most six months after they appear in print.

A '''cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM)''' is an abnormal connection between the [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s in the [[human brain|brain]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The most frequently observed problems related to an AVM are [[headache]]s and [[seizure]]s while at least 15% of the population at detection have no symptoms at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt; Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive [[weakness]] and [[numbness]] and vision changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Symptoms&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Symptoms |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;/&gt;

In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain ([[intracranial hemorrhage]]). Nevertheless in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;/&gt; Symptoms due to bleeding include loss of consciousness, sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], and blurred vision, amongst others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Symptoms&quot;/&gt; Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are also possible, including seizure, one-sided weakness ([[hemiparesis]]), a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body and deficits in language processing ([[aphasia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Symptoms&quot;/&gt;  Minor bleeding can occur with no noticeable symptoms.

AVMs in certain critical locations may stop the circulation of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], causing accumulation of the fluid within the skull and giving rise to a clinical condition called [[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000779.htm |title=Arteriovenous malformation - cerebral |author=David C. Dugdale, Daniel B. Hoch |month=10 |year=2008|publisher=ADAM |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stiff neck can occur as the result of increased pressure within the skull and irritation of the [[meninges]].

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Vein of galen ax direct AV.jpg|thumb|right|Axial image from computerized tomography angiogram showing arteriovenous communication in [[Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations|vein of Galen malformation]] ]]
An AVM diagnosis is established by [[neuroimaging]] studies after a complete neurological and physical examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Tests and diagnosis |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main techniques are used to visualize the brain and search for AVM: [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[cerebral angiography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; A CT scan of the head is usually performed first when the subject is symptomatic. It can suggest the approximate site of the bleed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt; MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of AVMs and provides better information about the exact location of the malformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; More detailed pictures of the tangle of blood vessels that compose an AVM can be obtained by using radioactive agents injected into the blood stream. If a CT is used in conjunction of dye this is called a computerized tomography angiogram while if MRI is used it is called [[magnetic resonance angiogram]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;  The best images of an AVM are obtained through [[cerebral angiography]]. This procedure involves using a [[catheter]], threaded through an artery up to the head, to deliver a contrast agent into the AVM.  As the contrast agent flows through the AVM structure, a sequence of [[X-ray]] images are obtained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;

==Grading==
A common method of grading cerebral AVMs is the Spetzler-Martin grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spetzler|first=R|coauthors=Martin N|journal=J Neurosurg|year=1986|volume=65|pages=476-83|pmid=3760956}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was designed to assess the patient's risk of neurological deficit after open surgical resection, based on characteristics of the AVM itself. Based on this system, AVMs may be classified as grades 1 - 5.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! AVM size !! Adjacent eloquent cortex !! Draining veins
|-
| Under 3 cm = 1 || Non-eloquent = 0  || Superficial only = 0
|-
| 3-6 cm = 2 || Eloquent* = 1|| Deep veins = 1
|-
| Over 6 cm = 3 ||  || 
|}

*Such as sensory or motor cortex, language or visual areas, brain stem, etc.

The risk of post-surgical neurological deficit (difficulty with language, motor weakness, vision loss) increases with increasing Spetzler-Martin grade. 

==Pathophysiology==
AVMs are an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the human brain. Arteriovenous malformations are most commonly of [[prenatal]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=causes |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Causes |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of AVMs remains unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; In a normal brain [[oxygen]] enriched blood from the heart travels in sequence through smaller blood vessels going from arteries, to [[arterioles]] and then [[capillary|capillaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; Oxygen is removed in the latter vessel to be used by the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; After the oxygen is removed blood reaches [[venules]] and later veins which will take it back to the heart and lungs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; On the other hand when there is an AVM blood goes directly from arteries to veins through the abnormal vessels disrupting the normal circulation of blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The main risk is [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. This risk is difficult to quantify since many patients with asymptomatic AVMs will never come to medical attention. Small AVMs tend to bleed more often than do larger ones, the opposite of cerebral aneurysms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=PM|coauthors=et al|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=49|pages=1-10|pmid=3958721}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a rupture or bleeding incident occurs, the blood may penetrate either into the brain tissue ([[cerebral hemorrhage]]) or into the [[subarachnoid space]], which is located between the sheaths ([[meninges]]) surrounding the brain ([[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]). Bleeding may also extend into the [[ventricular system]] ([[intraventricular hemorrhage]]). Cerebral hemorrhage appears to be most common.
&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt;
One long-term study (mean follow up greater than 20 years) of over 150 symptomatic AVMs (either presenting with bleeding or seizures) found the risk of cerebral hemorrhage to be approximately 4% per year, slightly higher than the 2-3% seen in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ondra|first=SL|coauthors=et al|journal=J Neurosurgery|year=1990|volume=73|pages=387-391|pmid=2384776}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple, rough approximation of a patient's lifetime bleeding risk is 105 - (patient age in years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Mark|title=Handbook of Neurosurgery (7th ed)|year=2010|publisher=Thieme|pages=1100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This equation assumes a 3% yearly bleeding risk. For example, a healthy 30 year old patient would have approximately a 75% lifetime risk of at least one bleeding event.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the location and size of the AVM and whether there is bleeding or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Treatments and drugs |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment in the case of sudden bleeding is focused on restoration of vital function.  Anticonvulsant medications such as [[phenytoin]] are often used to control seizure; medications or procedures may be employed to relieve intracranial pressure.  Eventually, curative treatment may be required to prevent recurrent hemorrhage. However, any type of intervention may also carry a risk of creating a neurological deficit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Surgical elimination of the blood vessels involved is the preferred curative treatment for many types of AVM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; Surgery is performed by a [[neurosurgeon]] who temporarily removes part of the skull ([[craniotomy]]), separates the AVM from surrounding brain tissue, and resects the abnormal vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; While  surgery can result in an immediate, complete removal of the AVM, risks exist depending on the size and the location of the malformation. The preferred treatment of Spetzler-Martin grade 1 and 2 AVMs in young, healthy patients is surgical resection due to the relatively small risk of neurological damage compared to the high lifetime risk of hemorrhage. Grade 3 AVMs may or may not be amenable to surgery. Grade 4 and 5 AVMs are not usually surgically treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Starke|first=RM|coauthors=et al|journal=Br J Neurosurg|year=2009|volume=23|pages=86|pmid=19637008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Radiosurgery]] has been widely used on small AVMs with considerable success.  The [[Gamma Knife]] is an apparatus used to precisely apply a controlled radiation dosage to the volume of the brain occupied by the AVM. While this treatment does not require an incision and craniotomy (with their own inherent risks), three or more years years may pass before the complete effects are known, during which time patients are at risk of bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; Complete obliteration of the AVM may or may not occur after several years, and repeat treatment may be needed. Radiosurgery is itself not without risk. In one large study, nine percent of patients had transient neurological symptoms, including headache, after radiosurgery for AVM. However, most symptoms resolved, and the long-term rate of neurological symptoms was 3.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flickinger|first=JC|coauthors=et al|journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys|year=1998|volume=40|pages=273-278|pmid=9457809}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Embolization]] is the occlusion of blood vessels most commonly with a glue-like substance introduced by a [[Radiology|radiographically]] guided [[catheter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; Such glue blocks the vessel and reduces blood flow into the AVM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt;  Embolization is frequently used as an adjunct to either surgery or radiation treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; Before other treatments it reduces the size of the AVM while during surgery it reduces the risk of bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; However, embolization alone may completely obliterate some AVMs.

==Epidemiology==
The annual new detection rate [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of AVMs is approximately 1 per 100000 a year. The [[point prevalence]] in adults is approximately 18 per 100000.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Al-Shahi R, Warlow C |title=A systematic review of the frequency and prognosis of arteriovenous malformations of the brain in adults |journal=Brain |volume=124 |issue=Pt 10 |pages=1900–26 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11571210 |doi= 10.1093/brain/124.10.1900|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/10/1900?view=long&amp;pmid=11571210 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; AVMs are more common in males than females, although in females [[pregnancy]] may start or worsen symptoms due the increase in [[blood flow]] and [[blood volume|volume]] it usually brings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-RF&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=risk-factors |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Risk factors |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research directions==
No randomized, controlled clinical trial has established a survival benefit for treating patients (either with open surgery or radiosurgery) with AVMs that have not yet bled. An international study is currently under way to evaluate the best management strategy for patients with unruptured AVMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARUBA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arubastudy.org/|title=The ARUBA trial-A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Romance-lg-classification-en.png|thumb|375px|Linguistic map representing a [[Tree model]] of the Romance languages based on the comparative method. Here the family tree has been rendered as a [[Venn diagram]] without overlapping subareas. The [[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]] allows overlapping regions.]]

In [[linguistics]], the '''comparative method''' is a technique for studying the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages, as opposed to the method of [[internal reconstruction]], which analyzes the internal development of a single language over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|pp=31 ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesized relationships between languages.

The comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rasmus Rask]] and [[Karl Verner]] and the German scholar [[Jacob Grimm]]. The first linguist to offer [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed forms]] from a [[proto-language]] was [[August Schleicher]], in his ''Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', originally published in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is Schleicher’s explanation of why he offered reconstructed forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleicher|1874|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the present work an attempt is made to set forth the inferred Indo-European original language side by side with its really existent derived languages. Besides the advantages offered by such a plan, in setting immediately before the eyes of the student the final results of the investigation in a more concrete form, and thereby rendering easier his insight into the nature of particular Indo-European languages, there is, I think, another of no less importance gained by it, namely that it shows the baselessness of the assumption that the non-Indian Indo-European languages were derived from Old-Indian (Sanskrit).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Fi-ugr-turk-comparison.png|thumb|375px|Various linguists have seen these North Eurasian languages as part of: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a [[Ural-Altaic]] [[language family]] (popular until 1960s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a [[Uralic]] and an [[Altaic]] family ([[Anna V. Dybo|Dybo]], [[Roy Andrew Miller|Miller]], [[Nicholas Poppe|Poppe]])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;separate Uralic, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] families ([[Gerard Clauson|Clauson]], [[Gerhard Dörfer|Dörfer]], [[Stefan Georg|Georg]])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a [[Eurasiatic]] or [[Nostratic]] [[macrofamily]] ([[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]], [[Sergei Starostin|Starostin]], [[Allan Bomhard|Bomhard]])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;]]

== Demonstrating genetic relationship ==
The comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically [[attested language]]s are descended from a single [[proto-language]] by comparing lists of [[cognate]] terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular [[sound change]]s can then be postulated, which allows the proto-language to be [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]]. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is [[feasible]], and if regular sound correspondences can be established with chance similarities ruled out.

===Terminology===
''Descent'' is defined as transmission across the generations: children learn a language from the parents' generation and after being influenced by their peers transmit it to the next generation, and so on. For example, a continuous chain of speakers across the centuries links [[Vulgar Latin]] to all of its modern descendants.

Two languages are ''[[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]]ally related'' if they descended from the same [[Proto-language|ancestor language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] both come from [[Latin]] and therefore belong to the same family, the [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is possible for languages to have different degrees of relatedness. [[English language|English]], for example, is related to both [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], but is more closely related to the former than it is to the latter. Although all three languages share a common ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], English and German also share a more recent common ancestor, [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], while Russian does not. Therefore, English and German are considered to belong to a different subgroup, the [[Germanic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp=22, 27–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shared retentions'' from the parent language are not sufficient evidence of a sub-group. For example, as a result of heavy [[loanword|borrowing]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], Modern Persian in fact takes more of its [[vocabulary]] from Arabic than from its direct ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2000|p=1341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of related languages into sub-groups is more certainly accomplished by finding ''shared linguistic innovations'' from the parent language.

===Origin and development of the method===
[[File:Sajnovics - Demonstratio.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Sajnovic's 1770 work.]]
Languages have been compared since antiquity. For example, in the 1st century BC the Romans were aware of the similarities between Greek and Latin, which they explained mythologically, as the result of Rome being a Greek colony speaking a debased dialect. In the 9th or 10th century, [[Yehuda Ibn Quraysh]] compared the phonology and morphology of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic, but attributed this resemblance to the Biblical story of Babel, with Abraham, Isaac and Joseph retaining Adam's language, with other languages at various removes becoming more altered from the original Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The reason for this similarity and the cause of this intermixture was their close neighboring in the land and their genealogical closeness, since Terah the father of Abraham was Syrian, and Laban was Syrian. Ishmael and Kedar were Arabized from the Time of Division, the time of the confounding [of tongues] at Babel, and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob (peace be upon them) retained the Holy Tongue from the original Adam.&quot; [http://lameen.googlepages.com/ibn-quraysh.html Introduction of Risalat Yehuda Ibn Quraysh - مقدمة رسالة يهوذا بن قريش]&lt;/ref&gt;

In publications of 1647 and 1654, [[Marcus van Boxhorn]] first described a rigid methodology for historical linguistic comparisons&lt;ref name=Driem&gt;George van Driem [http://www.eastling.org/paper/Driem.pdf The genesis of polyphyletic linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed the existence of an [[Indo-European]] proto-language (which he called &quot;Scythian&quot;) unrelated to Hebrew, but ancestral to Germanic, Greek, Romance, Persian, Sanskrit, Slavic, Celtic and Baltic languages. The Scythian theory was further developed by [[Andreas Jäger]] (1686) and [[William Wotton]] (1713), who made first forays to reconstruct this primitive common language.&lt;!-- ?? Perhaps he just proposed to do so. --&gt; In 1710 and 1723, [[Lambert ten Kate]] first formulated the regularity of [[sound law]]s, introducing among others, the term [[root vowel]].&lt;ref name=Driem/&gt;

Another early systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of [[grammar]] and [[lexicon]] was made by the Hungarian [[János Sajnovics]] in 1770, when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (work that was later extended to the whole [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language family]] in 1799 by his countryman [[Samuel Gyarmathi]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;ssix&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the origin of modern [[historical linguistics]] is often traced back to [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], an English [[Philology|philologist]] living in [[India]], who in 1786 made his famous {{nowrap|observation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Sir William|title=The Third Anniversary Discourse delivered 2 February 1786 By the President [on the Hindus]|editor-first=Guido|editor-last=Abbattista|publisher=Eliohs Electronic Library of Historiography|url=http://www.eliohs.unifi.it/testi/700/jones/Jones_Discourse_3.html|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The [[Sanskrit|Sanscrit language]], whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], more copious than the [[Latin language|Latin]], and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.  There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the [[Gothic language|Gothick]] and the [[Celtic languages|Celtick]], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the [[Old Persian language|old Persian]] might be added to the same family.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comparative method developed out of attempts to reconstruct the proto-language mentioned by Jones, which he did not name, but subsequent linguists named [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). The first professional comparison between the [[Indo-European languages]] known then was made by the German linguist [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816. Though he did not attempt a reconstruction, he demonstrated that Greek, Latin and Sanskrit shared a common structure and a common lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in 1808 first stated the importance of using the eldest possible form of a language when trying to prove its relationships;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1818, [[Rasmus Christian Rask]] developed the principle of regular sound changes to explain his observations of similarities between individual words in the Germanic languages and their cognates in Greek and {{nowrap|Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szémerenyi|1996|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Jacob Grimm]] - better known for his [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|''Fairy Tales'']] - in ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (published 1819-37 in four volumes) made use of the comparative method in attempting to show the development of the [[Germanic languages]] from a common origin, the first systematic study of [[diachronic]] language change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Rask and Grimm were unable to explain apparent exceptions to the sound laws that they had discovered. Although [[Hermann Grassmann]] explained one of these anomalies with the publication of [[Grassmann's law]] in 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Karl Verner]] who in 1875 made a methodological breakthrough when he identified a pattern now known as [[Verner's law]], the first sound law based on comparative evidence showing that a [[phonology|phonological]] change in one [[phoneme]] could depend on other factors within the same word, such as the neighbouring phonemes and the position of the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; now called ''conditioning environments''.

Similar discoveries made by the ''Junggrammatiker'' (usually translated as [[Neogrammarians]]) at the [[University of Leipzig]] in the late 1800s led them to conclude that all sound changes were ultimately regular, resulting in the famous statement by [[Karl Brugmann]] and [[Hermann Osthoff]] in 1878 that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is fundamental to the modern comparative method, since the method necessarily assumes regular correspondences between sounds in related languages, and consequently regular sound changes from the proto-language. This ''Neogrammarian Hypothesis'' led to application of the comparative method to reconstruct [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] being at that time by far the most well-studied language family. Linguists working with other families soon followed suit, and the comparative method quickly became the established method for uncovering linguistic relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssix&quot;/&gt;

===Application===
{{IPA notice}}
There is no fixed set of steps to be followed in the application of the comparative method, but [[Lyle Campbell]] suggests some basic steps&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp=126–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so does [[Terry Crowley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crowley|1992|pp=108–109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who are both authors of introductory texts in historical linguistics. The abbreviated summary below is based on their concepts of how to proceed.

====Step 1, assemble potential cognate lists====
This step involves making lists of words that are likely cognates among the languages being compared. If there is a regularly recurring match between the phonetic structure of basic words with similar meanings a genetic kinship can probably be established.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltwothree&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, looking at the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian family]] linguists might come up with a list similar to the following (a list actually used by them would be much longer):&lt;ref&gt;The table is modified from {{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp=168–169}} and {{harvnb|Crowley|1992|pp=88–89}} using sources such as {{harvnb|Churchward|1959}} for Tongan, and {{harvnb|Pukui|1986}} for Hawaiian.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[loanword|Borrowing]]s or [[false cognate]]s could skew or obscure the correct data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, English ''taboo'' ({{IPA|[tæbu]}}) is like the six Polynesian forms due to borrowing from Tongan into English, and not because of a genetic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/taboo|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|title=Taboo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem can usually be overcome by using basic vocabulary such as kinship terms, numbers, body parts, pronouns, and other basic terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, even basic vocabulary can be sometimes borrowed. [[Finnish language|Finnish]], for example, borrowed the word for &quot;mother&quot;, ''äiti'', from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''aiþei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp=65, 300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[English language|English]] borrowed the pronouns &quot;they&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, and &quot;their(s)&quot; from [[Old Norse language|Norse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/they|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|title= They}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomason and Everett argue&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Superficially, however, the Piraha pronouns don't look much like the Tupi-Guarani pronouns; so this proposal will not be convincing without some additional information about the phonology of Piraha that shows how the phonetic realizations of the Tupi-Guarani forms align with the Piraha phonemic system.&quot; [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/pronborr.pdf &quot;Pronoun borrowing&quot; Sarah G. Thomason &amp; Daniel L. Everett University of Michigan &amp; University of Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], a [[Muran languages|Muran language]] of South America for which a number of controversial claims are made,&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, Andrew, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues (2009). [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/%7Enevins/npr09.pdf &quot;Piraha Exceptionality: a Reassessment&quot;], Language&quot;, 85.2, 355-404.&lt;/ref&gt; borrowed all its [[pronoun]]s from [[Nhengatu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomason|2005|pp=8–12 in pdf}}; {{harvnb|Aikhenvald|1999|p=355}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Step 2, establish correspondence sets====
The next step is to determine the regular sound correspondences exhibited by the potential cognates lists. Mere phonetic similarity, as between [[English language|English]] ''day'' and [[Latin]] ''dies'' (both with the same meaning), has no probative value.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltwo&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; English initial ''d-'' does ''not'' regularly match {{nowrap|Latin ''d-'',&lt;ref name=&quot;bonetwoseven&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and whatever sporadic matches can be observed are due either to chance (as in the above example) or to [[loanword|borrowing]] (for example, Latin ''diabolus'' and English ''devil'', both ultimately of Greek origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=devil|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/devil}}&lt;/ref&gt;). English and Latin ''do'' exhibit a regular correspondence of ''t-'' : ''d-''&lt;ref name=&quot;bonetwoseven&quot;/&gt; (where the notation &quot;A : B&quot; means &quot;A corresponds to B&quot;); for example,&lt;ref&gt;In Latin, &lt;c&gt; represents {{IPA|/k/}}; ''dingua'' is an [[Old Latin]] form of the word later attested as ''lingua''.&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are many regular correspondence sets of this kind (the more the better), then a common origin becomes a virtual certainty, particularly if some of the correspondences are non-trivial or unusual.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltwothree&quot;/&gt;

====Step 3, discover which sets are in complementary distribution====
During the late 18th to late 19th century, two major developments improved the method's effectiveness.

First, it was found that many sound changes are conditioned by a specific ''context''. For example, in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[Stop consonant|stop]] evolved into an unaspirated one, but only if a second aspirate occurred later in the same word;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this is [[Grassmann's law]], first described for [[Sanskrit]] by [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit grammarian]] [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sag|1974|p=591}}; {{harvnb|Janda|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and promulgated by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1863.

Second, it was found that sometimes sound changes occurred
