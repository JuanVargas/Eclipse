The '''[[economic system|economy]] of the [[British Virgin Islands]]''' is one of the most prosperous in the [[Caribbean]]. According to the [[CIA World factbook]], in 2004 the Territory had the 12th highest [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html CIA - The World Factbook - Rank Order - GDP - per capita (PPP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The economy of the Territory is based upon the &quot;twin pillars&quot; of [[Offshore Financial Centre|financial services]], which generates approximately 60% of government revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.bviplatinum.com/news.php?module=news&amp;page=Article&amp;articleID=1268586|title=New Company Incorporations Down But Premier Remains Optimistic|date=2010-03-14|accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tourism]], which generates nearly all of the rest.

==Tourism==
An estimated 350,000 tourists, mainly from the [[United States]], visited the islands in 1997. The bulk of the tourism income in the British Virgin Islands is generated by the [[yacht]] [[charter]]ing industry. The Territory has relatively few large [[hotel]]s compared to other tourism centres in the Caribbean. The British Virgin Islands also entertain [[cruise ship]]s, although these generate relatively little revenue. However, cruise ship passengers are an important source of revenue for [[Taxicab|taxi]] drivers, who represent a politically important voice in the Territory.

==Financial services==
In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. An estimated 550,000 companies were on the offshore registry by the end of 2004. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offences, is expected to make the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business.

The British Virgin Islands is now one of the [[Offshore_Financial_Centre#List_of_main_offshore_financial_centres|world's leading offshore financial centres]]. Over 700,000 [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] have been formed in the British Virgin Islands, although only approximately 450,000 remain active (the remainder having been dissolved or struck off). This would account for approximately 42% of the estimated 1.1 million offshore companies incorporated worldwide.

Former president of the BVI's [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]], [[Michael Riegels]], recites the anecdote that the offshore finance industry commenced on an unknown date in the 1970s when a lawyer from a firm in New York telephoned him with a proposal to incorporate a [[company (law)|company]] in the British Virgin Islands to take advantage of a [[double taxation]] [[tax treaty|relief treaty]] with the United States. Within the space of a few years, hundreds of such companies had been incorporated.

This eventually came to the attention of the United States government, who unilaterally revoked the Treaty in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;The British Virgin Islands was not alone in this regard; this was part of a policy of mass-repeal by the United States of double tax relief treaties with &quot;[[microstate]]s&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the British Virgin Islands, trying to recapture some of the lost offshore business, enacted a new form of companies legislation, the [[International Business Companies Act]], under which an [[offshore company]] which was exempt from local taxes could be formed. The development was only a limited success until 1991, when the United States invaded [[Panama]] to oust General [[Manuel Noriega]]. At the time Panama was one of the largest providers of offshore financial services in the world, but the business fled subsequent the invasion, and the British Virgin Islands was one of the main beneficiaries.

In 2000, [[KPMG]] were commissioned by the British Government to produce a report on the offshore financial industry generally, and the report indicated that nearly 41% of the offshore companies in the world were formed in the British Virgin Islands. The British Virgin Islands is now one of the [[Offshore Financial Centre#List of main offshore financial centres|world's leading offshore financial centres]], and boasts one of the highest incomes per capita in the Caribbean.

On 12 April 2007 the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that the British Virgin Islands was the second largest source of [[foreign direct investment]] in the world (behind [[Hong Kong]]) with over US$123,000,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2aec1ac0-e893-11db-b2c3-000b5df10621,_i_email=y.html FT.com / Lex - The Russians are coming&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of these sums are directly attributable to investment through the Territory's [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore finance industry]].

==Agriculture==
[[Livestock]] raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements.

==Dollarisation==
Because of traditionally close links with the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since 1959.

==Deregulation of the telephone market==
[[Image:BMobile BVI headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''b''mobile's headquarters in the BVI.]]
In 2006, the British Virgin Islands government undertook a [[deregulation]] of the telephone industry.&lt;ref&gt;Telecommunications Act (No 10 of 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2006, in common with many other Caribbean countries, [[Cable &amp; Wireless (Caribbean)]] had a statutory [[monopoly]]&lt;ref&gt;Under the Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited Telephones Act, 1975 (Cap 168)&lt;/ref&gt; on telephone and other electronic communications services.  However, in the 1990s, a local company called CCT Boatphone, which had previously provided radio boatphones to tourists on charter boats, expanded into cellular (mobile) telecommunications for land-based users.  Although technically in breach of the statutory monopoly, CCT Boatphone was backed by a powerful collection of local interests known as the BVI Investment Club.  Negotiations between Cable &amp; Wireless and CCT Boatphone led to a split of the monopolies, with Cable &amp; Wireless retaining a monopoly over fixed line and internet services, and CCT Boatphone keeping a ''de facto'' monopoly over cellular telephones.

In 2007 the Government abolished the previously existing monopolies under an order made pursuant to the new legislation.  The process proved politically fraught, and the Government's Minister for Communications and Works, Alvin Christopher, ended up leaving the Government and joining the opposition party as a result of the furore.  The process was also criticised as cumbersome and slow, the initial deregulation having been announced in 2004, and taking no less than three years to come to fruition through delays in legislation and regulation.

Although there have been no new entrants into the fixed line industry, the government issued three licenses under the new regime to cellular telephone service providers.  The existing provider, CCT Boatphone, obtained one license.  [[LIME_(Cable &amp; Wireless)|''B''mobile]], the cellular arm of Cable &amp; Wireless, obtained a second.  The third license was obtained by BVI Cable TV, a local cable television service.  The license in favour of BVI Cable was controversial, as the Regulator had announced in advance that only three licenses in total would be issued, and BVI Cable TV had crumbling cable television infrastructure, and was in no position to office cellular telephone services (and to date, has not offered any cellular telephone services, or anything other than simple cable television).  However, ''b''mobile's main regional competitor, [[Digicel]], was rejected for a license.  The decision was regarded as highly controversial in the local media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&amp;aid=2695 BVI Platinum news, 23 May 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&amp;aid=2782 BVI Platinum news, 4 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digicel then issued court proceedings against the Regulator, arguing that he had acted improperly by imposing an arbitrary limit of three licenses (although interestingly no complaint was made about the decision to prefer BVI Cable TV's improbable license over Digicel).  ''B''mobile was joined to the suit as an interested party.  High Court Judge Rita Joseph-Olivetti found in favour of Digicel and quashed the original decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&amp;aid=2713 BVI Platinum News, 25 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Digicel commenced separate proceedings against [[Cable and Wireless]] (as ''b''mobile's parent company) in the [[Courts of England and Wales|English courts]], claiming that Cable &amp; Wireless has unfairly stifled competition in several Caribbean jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2007/07/070719_phonewars.shtml BBC World news, 19 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the intervening period, ''b''mobile has obtained a virtual stranglehold on the cellular telecommunications market in the British Virgin Islands by a combination of low prices and aggressive advertising, as well as significant investment in infrastructure and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&amp;aid=2822 BVI Platinum news, 8 June 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&amp;aid=2959 BVI Platinum news, 25 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name = &quot;qrbmav&quot;&gt;7&lt;/ref&gt; Digicel was finally granted a licence on 17 December 2007 and plans to start operations in the BVI sometime in 2008.

'''Brunei''' is a country with a small, wealthy economy that is a mixture of foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and welfare measures, and village tradition. It is almost totally supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP is high, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing. The government has shown progress in its basic policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 is estimated at 2.5% due to higher oil prices in the second half.

Brunei is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, averaging about {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d}}. It also is the fourth-largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world.

|}
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 1.52 Bruneian Dollars only. Mean wages were $25.38 per manhour in 2009.

The government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it might disrupt Brunei's society. Work permits for foreigners are issued only for short periods and must be continually renewed. Despite these restrictions, foreigners make up a significant portion of the work force. The government reported a total work force of 122,800 in 1999, with an unemployment rate of 5.5%.

Oil and natural gas account for almost all exports. Since only a few products other than petroleum are produced locally, a wide variety of items must be imported. Brunei statistics show Singapore as the largest point of origin of imports, accounting for 25% in 1997. However, this figure includes some transshipments, since most of Brunei's imports transit Singapore. Japan and Malaysia were the second-largest suppliers. As in many other countries, Japanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles, construction equipment, electronic goods, and household appliances. The United States was the third-largest supplier of imports to Brunei in 1998.

Brunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance. BIA's guiding principle is to increase the real value of Brunei's foreign reserves while pursuing a diverse investment strategy, with holdings in the United States, Japan, western Europe, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.

The Brunei Government actively encourages more foreign investment. New enterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status, exempting profits from income tax for up to 5 years, depending on the amount of capital invested. The normal corporate income tax rate is 30%. There is no personal income tax or capital gains tax.

One of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the development of Brunei Malays as leaders of industry and commerce. There are no specific restrictions of foreign equity ownership, but local participation, both shared capital and management, is encouraged. Such participation helps when tendering for contracts with the government or Brunei Shell Petroleum.

Companies in Brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a branch of a foreign company and must be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders. Private companies must have a minimum of two but not more than 50 shareholders. At least half of the directors in a company must be residents of Brunei.

The government owns a cattle farm in Australia that supplies most of the country's beef.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2700.htm | US Department of State Report: Brunei&lt;/ref&gt; At 2,262 square miles (5,859&amp;nbsp;km²), this ranch is larger than Brunei itself. Eggs and chickens are largely produced locally, but most of Brunei's other food needs must be imported. Agriculture and fisheries are among the industrial sectors that the government has selected for highest priority in its efforts to diversify the economy.

==Oil and gas industry==
[[Brunei Shell Petroleum]] (BSP), a joint venture owned in equal shares by the Brunei Government and the [[Royal Dutch]]/Shell group of companies, is the chief oil and gas production company in Brunei. It also operates the country's only refinery. BSP and four sister companies constitute the largest employer in Brunei after the government. BSP's small refinery has a distillation capacity of {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d}}. This satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products.

The French oil company [[Elf Aquitaine]] became active in petroleum exploration in Brunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells drilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in early 1990. Recently, [[UNOCAL]], partnered with New Zealand's [[Fletcher Challenge]] has been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.

Brunei's oil production peaked in 1979 at over {{convert|240000|oilbbl/d}}. Since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of [[oil reserves]] and improve recovery rates. Petroleum production is currently averaging some {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d}}. Japan has traditionally been the main customer for Brunei's oil exports, but its share dropped from 45% of the total in 1982 to 19% in 1998. In contrast, oil exports to South Korea increased from only 8% of the total in 1982 to 29% in 1998. Other major customers include [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] (6%), and the countries of ASEAN (27%). Brunei's oil exports to the United States accounted for 17% of the total exported.

Almost all of Brunei's natural gas is liquefied at [[Brunei LNG|Brunei Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant]], which opened in 1972 and is one of the largest LNG plants in the world. Over 82% of Brunei's LNG produced is sold to Japan under a long-term agreement renewed in 1993. The agreement calls for Brunei to provide over 5 million tons of LNG per year to three Japanese utilities. The Japanese company, Mitsubishi, is a joint venture partner with Shell and the Brunei Government in Brunei LNG, Brunei Coldgas, and Brunei Shell Tankers, which together produce the LNG and supply it to Japan. Since 1995, Brunei has supplied more than 700,000 tons of LNG to the Korea Gas Corporation as well. In 1999, Brunei's natural gas production reached 90 cargoes per day. A small amount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation. Brunei is the fourth-largest exporter of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region behind Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia.

Brunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient until at least 2015, and planned deep sea exploration is expected to find significant new reserves. The government sought in the past decade to diversify the economy with limited success. Oil and gas and government spending still account for most of Brunei's economic activity. Brunei's non-petroleum industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, and banking.

==Petrochemical industry==

In the western part of the country, [[Liang]] is currently experiencing a major development with the establishment of SPARK&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mofat.gov.bn/trade/invest/investment_opportunities.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
, which is a 271 hectare site developed to be a world class petrochemical hub. The first major investment at SPARK is the USD450 million [[Methanol]] plant developed by the Brunei Methanol Company, a joint venture between [[Petroleum]] Brunei and two leading Japanese companies, [[Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation]] and [[Itochu Corporation]]. The plant design will give an output of 2,500t of methanol per day (850,000t annually). The plant was officially launched by His Majesty [[Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]] on the 25th of May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.brunei.fm/2010/05/26/hm-launches-methanol-plant-opening/ | Official Launching of Brunei Methanol Company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomic trend==
This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at market prices [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 estimated] by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of [[Bruneian Dollar]]s.

In the 1970s, Brunei invested sharply increasing revenues from petroleum exports and maintained government spending at a low and constant rate. Consequently, the government was able to build its foreign reserves and invest them around the world to help provide for future generations. Part of the reserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's annual budget deficit. Since 1986, however, petroleum revenues have decreased, and government spending has increased. The government has been running a budget deficit since 1988. The disappearance of a revenue surplus has made Brunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations.

Brunei's gross domestic product (GDP) soared with the petroleum price increases of the 1970s to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980. It declined slightly in each of the next 5 years, then fell by almost 30% in 1986.

This drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in world markets and voluntary production cuts in Brunei. The GDP recovered somewhat since 1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989. In recent years, GDP growth was 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an estimated 2.5% in 1999. However, the 1999 GDP was still only about $4.5 billion, well below the 1980 peak.

The [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 and 1998, coupled with fluctuations in the price of oil have created uncertainty and instability in [[Brunei]]'s economy. In addition, the 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei's largest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy, caused the country to slip into a mild recession.

===Broadband access===
[[Brunei]]'s internet service is monopolized by a recently incorporated company TelBru under their &quot;[http://www.brunet.bn/ Brunet]&quot; department. ADSL speeds range from 512 kbit/s to the maximum speed of 1 Mbit/s through [[ADSL]] broadband. 1 Mbit/s was only recently introduced in 2006 and priced at BND$128 per month (Equivalent to Singapore currency). It is known that the Brunei's broadband ranging from 512 kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s is one the most expensive in the world. The limited market in Brunei means that development in the telecommunications sector is stagnant. Currently only about 11000 users out of a population of 380,000 have any connection to the Internet. More and more{{quantify|date=October 2010}} users are subscribing to 3G Mobile services. Broadband coverage has spanned the whole of Brunei since the release of &quot;E-Speed 2&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Brunei}}
[[Brunei]] joined [[ASEAN]] on January 7, 1984, one week after resuming full independence, and gives its ASEAN membership the highest priority in its foreign relations. Brunei joined the [[UN]] in September 1984. It also is a member of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) , the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2000. In 2005 it attended the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]].

Brunei has a number of [[Bruneian diplomatic missions|diplomatic missions abroad]] and has close relations with [[Singapore]], sharing an interchangeable currency regime as well as close military relations with the latter island-state. Aside from relations with other ASEAN states, Brunei also has extensive relations with the Islamic and Arab world.

==Bilateral relations==
===Bangladesh===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Bangladesh#State of Brunei}}
Bilateral relations are excellent between the two predominantly moderate Muslim nations. They are both members of OIC, Commonwealth and [[NAM]] and share common views on regional and international issues. Brunei recognised Bangladesh quickly with other Southeast Asian countries and Bangladesh established residential Diplomatic mission in 1985, although it was closed down from 1988 to 1997 due to financial constraints. Brunei has a residential embassy located in Dhaka. Brunei actively supports Bangladesh's candidacy for different regional and international organisations.

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Malaysia-Brunei relations}}
Brunei has a high commission in [[Kuala Lumpur]], and Malaysia has a high commission in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. Like Brunei, Malaysia is a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Malaysia's land boundary with Brunei around [[Limbang]] is currently in dispute.
===Singapore===
Brunei and Singapore agreed to have Singapore train its armed forces with Brunei. Both currencies have same value and are legal tender in both countries. Like Brunei, Singapore is a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations.

===Philippines===
In April 2009, Brunei and The [[Philippines]] signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) that seeks to strengthen the bilateral cooperation of the two countries in the fields of agriculture and farm-related trade and investments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessmirror.com.ph/home/economy/9637-rp-brunei-sign-farm-cooperation-deal.html &quot;RP, Brunei sign farm-cooperation deal&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The MOU further strengthened bilateral cooperation between the two Southeast Asian countries, particularly in the fields of agriculture and farm-related trade and investments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;fi=p090430.htm&amp;no=13&amp;r=&amp;y=&amp;mo= &quot;RP, Brunei seal agricultural cooperation deal&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The two countries have agreed to cooperate in plant science, crops technology, vegetable and fruit preservation, biotechnology, post-harvest technology, livestock, organic agriculture, irrigation and water resources and [[Halal]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/159314/RP-Brunei-agree-to-strengthen-bilateral-ties-in-agriculture &quot;RP, Brunei agree to strengthen bilateral ties in agriculture&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
See also [[Pakistan-Brunei relations]]

Pakistan has a High Commission in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] and Brunei has a High Commission in [[Islamabad]]. Pakistanis initially hesitated to recognise the country since its close ties with [[Malaysia]] what they considered as part of Malaya.{{Clarify me|date=May 2009}}

===Russia===

{{main|Brunei–Russia relations}}

Brunei maintains an embassy in [[Moscow]], Russian embassy in Brunei was established in March, 2010.

===United States===

{{main|Brunei – United States relations}}

The U.S. welcomed Brunei Darussalam's full independence from the United Kingdom on January 1, 1984, and opened an [[embassy]] in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] on that date. Brunei opened its embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] in March 1984. [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces|Brunei's armed forces]] engage in joint exercises, training programs, and other military cooperation with the U.S. A memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation was signed on November 29, 1994.  The [[Sultan of Brunei]] visited Washington in December 2002.

'''[[Bulgaria]]''' is a country situated in south-eastern [[Europe]], bordering [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] and the [[Black Sea]]. Its northern border with Romania follows the [[Danube]] river until [[Silistra]]. The land area of Bulgaria is 110,550 square kilometers, slightly larger than that of [[Iceland]] or the [[U.S. state]] of [[Tennessee]]. The country is situated on the west coast of the Black Sea, with Romania to the north, Greece and Turkey to the south, and Serbia and Macedonia to the west. Considering its small size, Bulgaria has a great variety of topographical features. Even within small parts of the country, the land may be divided into plains, plateaus, hills, mountains, basins, gorges, and deep river valleys. The [[geographic center of Bulgaria]] is located in [[Uzana]].

Bulgaria features notable diversity with the landscape ranging from the [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] snow-capped peaks in [[Rila]], [[Pirin]] and the [[Balkan Mountains]] to the mild and sunny Black Sea coast; from the typically [[continental climate|continental]] [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]] (ancient [[Moesia]]) in the north to the strong [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climatic influence]] in the valleys of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and in the lowlands in the southernmost parts of [[Thrace]].

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bulgaria straddles the [[Illyria]]n and [[Euxinia]]n provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region|Circumboreal region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom|Boreal kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and to the [[European Environment Agency]]'s Digital Map of European Ecological Regions, the territory of Bulgaria subdivides into two main [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Balkan mixed forests]] and Rhodope montane mixed forests. Small parts of four other ecoregions also occur on Bulgarian territory.

'''Geographic coordinates:'''
{{Coord|43|N|25|E|display=inline,title}}

==Boundaries==
Although external historical events often changed Bulgaria's national boundaries in its first century of existence, natural terrain features defined most boundaries after 1944, and no significant group of people suffered serious economic hardship because of border delineation. Postwar Bulgaria contained a large percentage of the ethnic [[Bulgarian people]], although numerous migrations into and out of Bulgaria occurred at various times. None of the country's borders was officially disputed in 1991, although nationalist Bulgarians continue to claim that Bulgaria's share of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]—which it shares with both [[Republic of Macedonia]] and Greece—is less than just because of the ethnic connection between Macedonians and Bulgarians.

Bulgaria has a total border of about 2,264&amp;nbsp;km. Rivers account for about 680&amp;nbsp;km and the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea coast]] for 400&amp;nbsp;km; the southern and western borders are mainly defined by [[ridge]]s in high terrain. The western and northern boundaries are shared with [[Serbia]] and Romania, respectively, and the Black Sea coastline constitutes the entire eastern border. The Romanian border follows the Danube for 464&amp;nbsp;km from the northwestern corner of the country to the city of [[Silistra]] and then cuts to the east-southeast for 136&amp;nbsp;km. The Danube, with steep bluffs on the Bulgarian side and a wide area of swamps and marshes on the Romanian side, is one of the most effective river boundaries in Europe. The line through [[Dobruja]] is arbitrary and was redrawn several times according to international treaties. In that process, most inhabitants with strong national preferences resettled in the country of their choice. Borders to the south are with Greece and Turkey, the border with Greece being 491 kilometres long, and the Turkish border having a length of 240 kilometres.

==Topography==
The [[Terrain|relief]] of Bulgaria is varied. In the relatively small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges. The main characteristic of Bulgaria's topography is alternating bands of high and low terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands (called [[geomorphological]] regions) are the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], [[Stara Planina]], the Transitional region and the [[Rila|Rilo]]-[[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] [[Massif]]. The easternmost sections near the [[Black Sea]] are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost part of the country is entirely high ground.

More than two-thirds of the country is plains, plateaus, or hilly land at an altitude less than 600 m. Plains (below 200 m) make up 31 % of the land, plateaus and hills (200 to 600 m) 41 %, low mountains (600 to 1,000 m) 10 %, medium-sized mountains (1,000 to 1,500 m) 10 %, and high mountains (over 1,500 m) 3 %. The average altitude in Bulgaria is 470 m.

The contemporary relief of the country is a result of continuous [[geological]] evolution. Due to that evolution there are [[magmatic rocks|magmatic]], [[sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] of different origin, age and composition. Their formation began more than 500&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the [[Precambrian]] and continues till now. The Bulgarian lands were often submerged by ancient seas and lakes, some land layers rose others sank. [[Volcanic eruption]]s were common both on land and in the water basins.

===Danubian plain===
[[Image:stara planina2.JPG|thumb|right|400px|View across the Danubian Plain towards the central Balkan Mountains 90 km away]]

The Danubian Plain extends from the western borders to the Black Sea. It encompasses the area between the [[Danube]] River, which forms most of the country's northern border, and Stara Planina to the south. It covers the Moesian plate. As a result of the rock weathering processes the relief is uneaven with flat rising grounds along the valleys and plateaus to the east. The plateau slopes gently from cliffs along the river, then it abuts into the low northern mountains of the Balkan range. The highest point is Tarnov Dyal (502 m) in the Shumen Plateau. The valleys of [[Vit]] and [[Yantra River|Yantra]] divide the Danubian plain into three parts - western, central and eastern. The altitude rises from west to east. To the north the plain has steep shores along the Danube or forms fertile [[alluvial plain]]s (Vidinska, Chernopolska, Belenska, Pobrezhie, Aidemirska).

Hilly heights and plateaus are typical for the topography of plain. Most of the heights and all plateaus are situated into the eastern parts. There are 14 [[basalt]] mounds between [[Svishtov]] and the village of [[Dragomirovo]].

===Stara Planina===
[[Image:Pirdop below Stara Planina.jpg|200px|thumb|left|right|A view of Stara Planina from [[Pirdop]]]]
The southern edge of the Danubian Plain blends into the foothills of Stara Planina, sometimes thought of as the Bulgarian part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The Carpathians resemble a reversed S as they run eastward from the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]] across the northern portion of Romania, swinging southward to the middle of Romania and then running westward, where they are known as the [[Transylvanian Alps]]. The mountains turn eastward again at the [[Iron Gate]], a gorge of the Danube River at the Romanian-Serbian border. At that point, they become Stara Planina of Bulgaria.

Stara Planina originates at the [[Timok Valley]] in [[Serbia]] and run southward towards the [[Sofia Basin]] in west central Bulgaria. From there they run east to the Black Sea. The Balkans are about 600&amp;nbsp;km long and 30 to 50&amp;nbsp;km wide. They retain their height well into central Bulgaria, where [[Botev Peak]], the highest point in the Balkan Mountains, rises to about 2,376 m. The range then continues at lower altitude to the cliffs of the Black Sea. Through most of Bulgaria, the Balkans form the watershed from which rivers drain north to the Danube River or south to the [[Aegean Sea]]. Some smaller rivers in the east drain directly to the Black Sea. The [[Sredna Gora]] is a narrow ridge about 160&amp;nbsp;km long and 1,600 m high, running east to west parallel to the Balkans. Nested between both ranges is the [[Rose Valley]], famous for rose oil used in perfume and liqueurs.

===Subbalkan Valleys and Thracian Plain===
The southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains and the Sredna Gora give way to the [[Thracian Plain]] and the [[Sofia Basin]]. Roughly triangular in shape, the Thracian Plain originates at a point east of the mountains near [[Sofia]] and broadens eastward to the Black Sea. It includes the [[Maritsa]] valley and the lowlands that extend from the river to the Black Sea. Like the Danubian Plateau, much of the Thracian Plain is somewhat hilly and not a true plain. Most of its terrain is moderate enough to cultivate.

The largest basin in Bulgaria is the [[Sofia Basin]]. About 24&amp;nbsp;km wide and 96&amp;nbsp;km long, the basin contains the capital city and the area immediately surrounding it. The route through basins and valleys from [[Belgrade]] to [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]) via Sofia has been historically important since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], determining the strategic significance of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Bulgaria's largest cities were founded on this route. Paradoxically, although the mountains made many Bulgarian villages and towns relatively inaccessible, Bulgaria has always been susceptible to invasion because no natural obstacle blocked the route through Sofia.

===Rilo-Rhodope massif===
[[Image:Pirin pano0.jpg|800px|thumb|center|Panorama of Pirin]]

Relatively high mountains occupy the area between the Thracian Plain and Sofia Basin and the Greek border to the south. The western parts consist of three ranges: the [[Vitosha Mountain]] south of [[Sofia]], the [[Rila|Rila Mountains]] further south, and the [[Pirin Mountains]] in the southwestern corner of the country. They are the most outstanding topographic feature of Bulgaria and of the entire Balkan Peninsula. The Rila range includes [[Mount Musala]], whose 2,925-metre peak is the highest in any Balkan country. About a dozen other peaks in Rila are over 2,600 meters. The highest peaks are characterized by sparse bare rocks and remote lakes above the tree line. The lower peaks, however, are covered with alpine meadows that give the range an overall impression of green beauty. The Pirin range is characterized by rocky peaks and stony slopes. Its highest peak is [[Vihren|Mount Vihren]], at 2,915 meters the second-highest peak in Bulgaria. Further east are the extensive [[Rhodope Mountains]].

A significant part of Bulgaria's land is prone to earthquakes. Two especially sensitive areas are the borders of the [[North Bulgarian Swell]] (rounded elevation), the center of which is in the [[Gorna Oryahovitsa]] area in north-central Bulgaria, and the [[West Rhodopes Vault]], a wide area extending through the Rila and northern Pirin regions to [[Plovdiv]] in south-central Bulgaria. Especially strong tremors also occur along diagonal lines running between [[Skopje]] in the Republic of Macedonia and [[Razgrad]] in northeast Bulgaria, and from [[Albania]] eastward across the southern third of Bulgaria through Plovdiv. Sixteen major earthquakes struck Bulgaria between 1900 and 1986, the last two in [[Strazhitsa]] on the Skopje-Razgrad fault line. Together the two quakes damaged over 16,000 buildings, half of them severely. One village was almost completely leveled, others badly damaged. Many inhabitants were still living in temporary housing four years later.

==Hydrography==
Bulgaria has a dense network of about 540 rivers, but with the notable exception of the [[Danube]], most have short lengths and low water-levels.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Donchev |first=D. |title=Geography of Bulgaria |publisher=ciela |location=Sofia |page=68 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-649-717-7 |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rivers flow through mountainous areas; fewer in the Danubian Plain, [[Upper Thracian Plain]] and especially [[Dobrudzha]]. Two  catchment basins exist: the [[Black Sea]] (57% of the territory and 42% of the rivers) and the [[Aegean Sea]] (43% of the territory and 58% of the rivers) basins. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the [[Iskar River]], has a length of {{convert|368|km|0|abbr=on}}. Other major rivers include the [[Struma River|Struma]] and the [[Maritsa|Maritsa River]] in the south.

The [[Balkan Mountains]] divide Bulgaria into two nearly equal [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage systems]]. The larger system drains northward to the [[Black Sea]], mainly by way of the [[Danube River]]. This system includes the entire Danubian Plateau and a stretch of land running forty-eight to eighty kilometers inland from the coastline. The second system drains the [[Thracian Plain]] and most of the higher lands of the south and southwest to the [[Aegean Sea]]. Although only the Danube is navigable, many of the other rivers and streams in Bulgaria have a high potential for the production of hydroelectric power and are sources of irrigation water.

[[File:Mandrensko lake.jpg|thumb|300px|thumb|[[Lake Mandrensko]]]]

Of the Danube's Bulgarian tributaries, all but the [[Iskar River]] rise in the Balkan Mountains. The Iskur flows northward to the Danube from its origin in the Rila Mountains, passing through Sofia's eastern suburbs and through a Balkan Mountain valley.

The Danube gets slightly more than 4 % of its total volume from its Bulgarian tributaries. As it flows along the northern border, the Danube averages 1.6 to 2.4 kilometers in width. The river's highest water levels usually occur during June floods; it is frozen over an average of forty days per year.

Several major rivers flow directly to the [[Aegean Sea]]. Most of these streams fall swiftly from the mountains and have cut deep, scenic gorges. [[Maritsa]] with its tributaries is by far the largest draining all of the western [[Thracian Plain]], all of the [[Sredna Gora]], the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains, and the northern slopes of the eastern Rhodopes. After it leaves Bulgaria, the Maritsa forms most of the Greek-Turkish border. [[Struma]] and the [[Mesta River|Mesta]] (which separate the Pirin Mountains from the main Rhodopes ranges) are the next largest Bulgarian rivers flowing to the Aegean. Struma and Mesta reach the sea through Greece.

The Rila and Pirin mountain ranges feature around 260 glacial lakes; the country also has several large lakes on the Black Sea coast and more than 2,200 dam lakes. Many mineral springs exist, located mainly in the south-western and central parts of the country along the faults between the mountains.

The Bulgarian word for spa, ''баня'', transliterated as ''banya'', appears in some of the names of more than 50 [[spa town]]s and resorts including [[Sapareva Banya]], [[Hisarya, Bulgaria|Hisarya]], [[Sandanski]], [[Bankya]], [[Varshets]], [[Pavel Banya]], [[Devin, Bulgaria|Devin]], [[Velingrad]] and many others.

==Climate==
[[File:Satellite image of Bulgaria in December 2001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A satellite photo of Bulgaria in December.]]

Considering its small area, Bulgaria has an unusually variable and complex climate. The country lies between the strongly contrasting [[continental climate|continental]] and [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] climatic zones. Bulgarian mountains and valleys act as barriers or channels for air masses, causing sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short distances. The continental zone is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed [[Danubian Plain]]. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfalls; the Mediterranean influence increases during the second half of summer and produces hot and dry weather. The barrier effect of the Balkan Mountains is felt throughout the country: on the average, northern Bulgaria is about one degree cooler and receives about {{convert|192|mm|in|1}} more rain than lowlands of southern Bulgaria. Because the [[Black Sea]] is too small to be a primary influence over much of the country's weather, it only affects the immediate area along its coastline.

The [[Balkan Mountains]] are the northern boundary of the area in which continental air masses circulate freely. The [[Rhodope]] Mountains mark the northern limits of domination by Mediterranean weather systems. The area between, which includes the Northern [[Thracian Plain]], is influenced by a combination of the two systems, with the continental predominating. This combination produces a plains climate resembling that of the [[Corn Belt]] in the United States, with long summers and high humidity. The climate in this region is generally more severe than that of other parts of Europe in the same latitude. Because it is a transitional area, average temperatures and precipitation are erratic and may vary widely from year to year.

[[Image:Sofia Plain.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The north-western Danubian Plain in May]]

Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in Bulgaria is about {{convert|630|mm|in|1}} per year. [[Dobrudja]] in the northeast, the Black Sea coastal area, and small part of the Northern Thracian Plain usually receive less than 500 millimetres. The remainder of the Northern Thracian Plain and the Danubian Plateau get less than the country average; the Northern Thracian Plain is often subject to summer droughts. Higher elevations, which receive the most rainfall in the country, may average over {{convert|2540|mm|in}} per year.

[[File:Aldomirovtsi marsh before storm.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A view of [[Aldomirovtsi marsh]], with approaching stormclouds surrounding the nearby mountains]]

The many valley basins scattered through the uplands have temperature inversions resulting in stagnant air. Sofia is located in such a basin, but its elevation (about {{convert|530|m|ft|0|disp=/}}) tends to moderate summer temperature and relieve oppressive high humidity. Sofia is also sheltered from the northern European winds by the mountains that surround its troughlike basin. Temperatures in [[Sofia]] average {{convert|-3|°C|1}} in January and about {{convert|28|°C|1}} in August. The city's rainfall is near the country average, and the overall climate is pleasant.

In summer, temperatures in the southest Bulgaria often exceed {{convert|40|°C}} but remain cooler by the coast. The town of [[Sadovo]], near [[Plovdiv]], has recorded the highest known temperature: {{convert|45.2|°C|1}}. The recorded absolute minimum temperature of {{convert|-39.3|°C|1}} occurred west of Sofia, near the town of [[Tran, Bulgaria|Trun]]. The usual temperature around the Stara Planina region averages {{convert|10|°C}} to {{convert|15|°C}}.

The highest mountains – over {{convert|900|or|1000|m|ft|0}} above sea-level – have an alpine climate. The lowest parts of the Struma and Maritza river valleys are subjected to subtropical (Mediterranean) influence, as are the Eastern Rhodope or Low Rhodope mountains. The extreme south-west part of Bulgaria (near the towns of [[Sandanski]] and [[Petrich]]) has one of the warmest climates in the country.

The coastal climate is moderated by the Black Sea, but strong winds and violent local storms are frequent during the winter. Winters along the [[Danube]] River are bitterly cold, while sheltered low valleys opening to the south along the Greek and Turkish borders may be as mild as areas along the Mediterranean or Aegean coasts.

==Environment==
Like other former European members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]], Bulgaria saw unimpeded industrial growth as a vital sign of social welfare and progress toward the socialist ideal. Because this approach made environmental issues a taboo subject in socialist Bulgaria, the degree of damage by postwar industrial policy went unassessed until the government of [[Todor Zhivkov]] (1962–1989) was overthrown in late 1989. The Zhivkov government's commitment to heavy industry and lack of money to spend on protective measures forced it to conceal major environmental hazards, especially when relations with other countries were at stake. Factories that did not meet environmental standards paid symbolic fines and had no incentive to institute real environmental protection measures.

In 1991 Bulgarian environmentalists estimated that 60 % of the country's agricultural land was damaged by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers and by industrial fallout. In 1991 two thirds of Bulgarian rivers were polluted, and the [[Yantra River]] was classified as the dirtiest river in Europe. By that time, about two-thirds of the primary forests had been cut. However, despite its recognition of the need for greater environmental protection, Bulgaria budgeted only 10.4&amp;nbsp;billion [[Bulgarian lev|leva]].

[[Image:Sun Rays.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Forests and woodlands account for about 38% of Bulgaria's territory. This is a forest in Stara Planina]]

Perhaps the most serious environmental problem in Bulgaria was in the Danube port city of [[Rousse]]. From 1981 to 1989, the chemical pollution that spread from a [[chlorine]] and [[sodium]] plant across the Danube in [[Giurgiu]], Romania, was a forbidden subject in Bulgaria because it posed a threat to good relations between two Warsaw Pact countries. Chemical plants in Rousse also contributed to the pollution. Citizen environmentalists opposing the situation in Rousse organized the first demonstrations and the first independent political group to oppose the Zhivkov regime. During the Giurgiu plant's first year of operation, chlorine levels in Rousse almost doubled, reaching two times the permissible maximum in the summer of 1990. Over 3,000 families left the city in the 1980s despite government restrictions aimed at covering up the problem. Besides chlorine and its byproducts, the plant produced chemical agents for the rubber industry, and in 1991 some sources reported that the plant was processing industrial waste from Western countries—both activities likely to further damage Rousse's environment. International experts claimed that half of Rousse's pollutants came from Giurgiu, and the others came from Bulgarian industries. In response to the formidable Bulgarian environmental movement, some Bulgarian plants have been closed or have added protective measures; the Giurgiu plant, however, was planning to expand in 1991.

Pollution of agricultural land from a copper plant near the town of [[Pirdop|Srednogorie]] provoked harsh public criticism. The plant emitted toxic clouds containing [[copper]], [[lead]], and [[arsenic]]. In 1988 it released toxic wastewater into nearby rivers used to irrigate land in the Plovdiv-[[Pazardzhik]] Plain, which includes some of Bulgaria's best agricultural land. The groundwater beneath the plain also was poisoned. Work has begun on a plan to drain toxic wastewater from the plant's reservoir into the Maritsa River. Environmental improvements for the copper plant and three other factories in the Plovdiv area (a lead and zinc factory, a chemical factory, and a uranium factory) also were planned, but they would take years to implement.

None of Bulgaria's large cities escaped serious environmental pollution. Statistics showed that 70 to 80 % of Sofia's air pollution is caused by emissions from cars, trucks, and buses. Temperature inversions over the city aggravated the problem. Two other major polluters, the [[Kremikovtzi AD]] Metallurgy Works and the [[Buhovo]] [[uranium]] mine (both in southwestern Bulgaria), contaminated the region with lead, [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[ethanol]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The city of [[Kardzhali]] became heavily polluted with lead from its lead and zinc complex. In 1973 the petroleum and chemical plant near the Black Sea port of [[Burgas]] released large amounts of chlorine in an incident similar to the one in Srednogorie. Environmentalists estimated that the area within a thirty-kilometer radius of the plant was rendered uninhabitable by that release. The air in Burgas was also heavily polluted with carbon and sulfur dioxide in 1990.

In 1990 environmental scientists claimed that two-thirds of Bulgaria's population suffered from the polluted environment to some degree. In 1991 Bulgaria began seeking international assistance in solving environmental problems. Besides joining Romania, Turkey, and Russia in joint scientific studies of the critically polluted Black Sea, Bulgaria actively sought environmental technology and expertise from [[Western Europe]] and the United States.

==Political geography==
Bulgaria's political geography has changed greatly since the restoration of statehood in 1878. Russia, whose military victories had led to its creation, pushed for a &quot;big Bulgaria&quot; that would include much of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. At the [[Congress of Berlin, 1878|Congress of Berlin]], however, the powers insisted upon a much reduced area, divided until 1885 between the principalities of Bulgaria proper and [[Eastern Rumelia]].

An independent kingdom from 1908 to 1946 and thereafter a republic, Bulgaria sought to expand its territory in the two [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-13 and in World Wars [[World War I|I]] and [[World War II|II]]. Defeat in the last three conflicts led to a large loss of territory in 1913 and 1919, though the 1940 recovery of the [[Southern Dobruja]] was confirmed by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] of 1947.

{{Politics of Bulgaria}}
'''[[Politics]] of [[Bulgaria]]''' take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Minister-Chairman]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Since 1990, Bulgaria has an unstable party system, nowadays dominated by the post-communist social democratic [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] and the personalist liberal [[National Movement Simeon II]]. The [[United States|U.S.]] [[Freedom House]] considers Bulgaria a [[Freedom (political)|free country]].

== Developments since 1990 ==
The [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP) won the first post-communist Assembly elections in 1990 with a small majority. The BSP government formed at that time was brought down by a general strike in late 1990 and replaced by a transitional coalition government. Meanwhile, [[Zhelyu Zhelev]], a communist-era dissident, was elected President by the Assembly in 1990, and in 1992 won Bulgaria's first direct presidential elections. Zhelev served until early 1997. The country's first fully democratic Assembly elections, in November 1991, ushered in another coalition government, which was led by the pro-reform Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) in partnership with the Turkish party [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] (MRF). This coalition collapsed in late 1992, and was succeeded by a technocratic team, put forward by the MRF, which governed at the sufferance of the BSP for 2 years. The BSP won pre-term elections in December 1994 and remained in office until February 1997, when a populace alienated by the BSP's failed, corrupt government{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} demanded its resignation and called for new elections. A caretaker cabinet appointed by the President served until pre-term parliamentary elections in April 1997, which yielded a landslide victory for pro-reform forces led by the UDF in the United Democratic Forces coalition.

In 2001, former King [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] returned to power, this time as Prime Minister with his [[National Movement Simeon II]]. The last parliamentary elections took place on 25 June 2005.

Bulgaria did not decriminalize [[homosexuality]] until 2002, doing so to conform to [[European Union]] norms as it pressed for membership. Nevertheless, polls from the end of 2007 showed that 80% of Bulgarian respondents expressed a negative view of gays and lesbians, with 53% voicing an &quot;extremely negative&quot; view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaycitynews.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19208146&amp;BRD=2729&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=568864&amp;rfi=6 GayCityNews - E. Europe Still Anti-Gay Bloc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2005 the Bulgarian Parliament chose [[Sergey Stanishev]] of the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] as the new Prime Minister in a coalition government with the [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]. The vote was 120 against 119. However, the parliament voted against the cabinet's staff by 119 to 117 votes. Finally, on August 15, 2005, the BSP and [[National Movement Simeon II]] formed a stable government, along with the [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]. This [[grand coalition]] comprises the three largest parties. This coalition will have a large majority in parliament with 169 of the 240 deputies.

Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/eu_members/bulgaria/index_en.htm Bulgaria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Executive branch ==
The [[president of Bulgaria]] ([[Georgi Parvanov]] since 22 January 2002) is directly elected for a 5-year term with the right to one re-election. The president serves as the [[head of state]] and commander in chief of the armed forces. The President's main duties are to schedule elections and referendums, represent Bulgaria abroad, conclude international treaties, and head the Consultative Council for National Security. The President may return legislation to the National Assembly for further debate—a kind of veto—but the legislation can be passed again by an absolute majority vote.

The Council of Ministers is the principal organ of the executive branch. It is usually formed by the majority party in Parliament, if one exists, or by the largest party in Parliament along with coalition partners. Chaired by the Prime Minister, it is responsible for carrying out state policy, managing the state budget, and maintaining law and order. The Council must resign if the National Assembly passes a vote of no confidence in the Council or the Prime Minister or rejects a vote of confidence.
The current governmental coalition is made of the centre-right [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|Citizens for European Development]], and the [[Blue Coalition]], an alliance of small centre-right parties.

== Legislative branch ==
[[File:National Assembly of Bulgaria Sofia TB.jpg|thumb|350px|The National Assembly]]
The Bulgarian [[unicameral]] [[parliament]], the National Assembly or [[Narodno Sabranie]], consists of 240 deputies who are elected for 4-year-terms by popular vote. The votes are for party or coalition lists of candidates for each of the 28 administrative divisions. A party or [[coalition]] must garner a minimum of 4% of the vote in order to enter parliament. Parliament is responsible for enactment of laws, approval of the budget, scheduling of presidential elections, selection and dismissal of the [[prime Minister of Bulgaria|prime minister]] and other ministers, declaration of war, deployment of troops outside of Bulgaria, and ratification of international treaties and agreements.

== Judicial branch ==
The Bulgarian judicial system consists of regional, district and appeal courts, as well as a [[Supreme Court of Cassation of Bulgaria|Supreme Court of Cassation]]. In addition, there is a [[Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria|Supreme Administrative Court]] and a system of military courts. The Presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court as well as the [[Prosecutor General]] are elected by a qualified majority of two-thirds from all the members of the Supreme Judicial Council and are appointed by the President of the Republic. The Supreme Judicial Council is in charge of the self-administration and organisation of the Judiciary.

A qualified majority of two-thirds of the membership of the Supreme Judicial Council elects the Presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and of the Supreme Administrative Court, as well as the Prosecutor General, from among its members; the President of the Republic then appoints those elected.

The Supreme Judicial Council has charge of the self-administration and organization of the Judiciary.

The Constitutional Court supervises the review of the constitutionality of laws and statutes brought before it, as well as the compliance of these laws with international treaties that the Government has signed. Parliament elects the 12 members of the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds majority. The members serve for a nine-year term.

The territory of the Republic of Bulgaria subdivides into provinces and municipalities. Bulgaria has 28 provinces, each headed by a provincial governor appointed by the government. In addition, the country includes 263 municipalities.

The [[Constitutional Court of Bulgaria]] is in charge of reviewing the constitutionality of laws and statutes brought before it, as well as the compliance of these laws with international treaties that the Government has signed. The 12 members of the Constitutional Court serve a nine-year term. Parliament elects 1/3 of them.

==History==
{{Split2|Economic history of Bulgaria|date=March 2011}}

The economy declined dramatically during the 1990s with the collapse of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON) system and the loss of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] market, to which the country had been closely tied. The [[standard of living]] fell by about 40%, and only regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004. In addition, [[United Nations|UN]] [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against [[Serbia]] (1992–95) and [[Iraq]] took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged when [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] grew 1.4% in 1994 for the first time since 1988, and 2.5% in 1995. Inflation, which surged in 1994 to 122%, fell to 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed due to an unstable and decentralised banking system, a wave of hyperinflation throughout several countries of Eastern Europe, and slow reforms, which led to an inflation rate of 311% and the collapse of the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]]. When pro-reform forces came into power in the spring 1997, an ambitious{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} economic reform package, including introduction of a currency board regime, was agreed to with the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank]], and the economy began to stabilise. The 2000s saw a steady pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.

Successful foreign direct investment and successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning have contributed greatly to the Bulgarian economy, with a historical growth rate average of 6% a year. 

Corruption in the public administration and a weak judiciary have continued to be long-term problems, and the presence of organized crime remains very high.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A period of large trade deficits and improper real estate investment hit Bulgaria hard during the [[late-2000s recession]], resulting in a 12% GDP decline in that period, a rise in unemployment, and spending at least five quarters in its worst recession since the early 1980s.  However, this was not as severe compared to much of [[Europe]]. Future prospects are tied to the country's increasingly important integration with the European Union member states. However, the country came out of a recession in 2010, and stagnated for a short period of time. It has been recently predicted{{By whom|date=March 2011}} that the economy would grow modestly by 2011. The country is expected to join the [[Eurozone]] in 2013.

From the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in [[Eastern Europe]] in November 1989, the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP) exerted complete economic, social and political control in Bulgaria. The party's ascent to power in 1944 had marked the beginning of economic change towards [[planned economy]] in Bulgaria. After World War II, Bulgaria followed the Soviet model of economic development more closely than any other East Bloc country with becoming one of the first members of [[Comecon]]; the new regime shifted the economy from mainly agrarian type towards [[industrial economy]] and much of the labour force from the countryside to the city, providing workers for new large-scale industrial complexes. At the same time, the focus of Bulgarian international trade shifted from Central Europe to Eastern Europe and USSR.&lt;ref name=csecon&gt;William Marsteller. &quot;The Economy&quot;. [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bgtoc.html Bulgaria country study] (Glenn E. Curtis, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (June 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bg icon}} Милена Димитрова, ''[http://books.google.bg/books?id=jqJ6Ocql0XIC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84.+%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB+%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qjoQ7_s0ri&amp;sig=r8Ipr0mgFEGA-_y-5tIjMu8Npqg&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=PX9zTeiTHo7Dswb5kYyEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Златните десятилетия на българската електроника]'', изд. Труд, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

These new policies resulted in impressive initial rates. Bulgarian economy closely resembled that of the Soviet Union. Soviet-style centralised planning in five-year blocks had more immediate benefits there than in the other European states where it was first applied in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0058) Economic policies]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the postwar period, economic progress also was assisted substantially by a level of internal and external political stability unseen in other East European countries during the same period, that was also a change in Bulgarian political scene was a lot of turbulence preceded the ascent to power of [[Bulgarian Communist Party|BCP]].&lt;ref name=csecon/&gt;

Nonetheless, beginning in the early 1960s low capital and labour productivity and expensive material inputs plagued the Bulgarian economy. With disappointing rates of growth came a high degree of economic experimentation. This experimentation took place within the socialist economic framework, however, and it never approached a market-based economy.&lt;ref name=csecon/&gt;

In the late 1980s, continuing poor economic performance brought new economic hardship. By that time, the misdirection and irrationality of BCP economic policies had become quite clear. Bulgaria's economy contracted dramatically after 1987 with the dissolution of the [[Comecon]], with which the Bulgarian economy had integrated closely. Finally, on 10 November 1989, at the November plenum of BCP [[Todor Zhivkov]] was dismissed as a long-time party leader and head of state and the communist regime gave way to democratic elections and government. Unlike the communist parties in most other East European states, the BCP (changing its name to [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]) retained majority power after the transition in Bulgaria by winning the first free national elections in June 1990. That was made possible by changes in party leadership, programme, reduction of its power base and other which permitted economic reorientation toward a market system.  This difficult transition combined with political vagueness, unpreparedness of people for the social and economic changes led to seriously worsen economic conditions during early 90s.&lt;ref name=csecon/&gt; The standard of living fell with nearly 40% and more and regain levels in the beginning of 2000's.

===1990-2000===
The economy declined dramatically during the 1990s with the collapse of the [[Comecon]] system and the loss of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] market, to which the country had been closely tied. The [[standard of living]] fell by about 40%, and only regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004. In addition, [[United Nations|UN]] [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against [[Serbia]] (1992–95) and [[Iraq]] took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged when [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] grew 1.4% in 1994 for the first time since 1988, and 2.5% in 1995. Inflation, which surged in 1994 to 122%, fell to 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed due to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|Bulgarian Socialist Party's]] slow and mismanaged economic reforms and an unstable and decentralised banking system, which led to an inflation rate of 311% and the collapse of the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]]. When pro-reform forces came into power in the spring 1997, an ambitious economic reform package, including introduction of a currency board regime, was agreed to with the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank]], and the economy began to stabilise. The 2000s saw a steady  pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.

===Reforms of the 1990s and early 2000s===

Members of the government promised to move forward on cash and mass [[privatization]] upon taking office in January 1995 but were slow to act. [[United Nations]] sanctions against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Iraq sanctions|Iraq]] (1990–2003), two of the country's most significant trading partners, took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] grew and [[inflation]] fell. The first round of mass privatisation finally began in January 1996, and auctions began toward the end of that year. The second and third rounds were conducted in Spring 1997 under a new government. In July 1998, the UDF-led government and the IMF reached agreement on a 3-year loan worth about $800 million, which replaced the 14-month stand-by agreement that expired in June 1998. The loan was used to develop financial markets, improve social safety net programmes, strengthen the tax system, reform agricultural and energy sectors, and further liberalise trade. The [[European Commission]], in its 2002 country report, recognised Bulgaria as a functioning market economy, acknowledging the progress made by Prime Minister Simeon of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's government toward market-oriented reforms.

===Rebound from the February 1997 crisis===
In April 1997, the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) government won pre-term parliamentary elections and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of 1996 and 1997 has given way to an official [[economic growth]], but forecasters are predicting accelerated growth over the next several years. The government's structural reform program includes: (a) privatization and, where appropriate, liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (b) liberalization of agricultural policies, including creating conditions for the development of a land market; (c) reform of the country's social insurance programs; and (d) reforms to strengthen contract enforcement and fight crime and corruption. Despite reforms, weak control over privatization led many successful state enterprises to [[bankruptcy]]. The UDF government also failed to stop the growing negative account balance, which has since then continued to increase, reaching a negative of $ 12.65 billion in 2008. The government elected in 2001 pledged to maintain the fundamental economic policy objectives adopted by its predecessor in 1997, specifically: retaining the Currency Board, implementing sound financial policies, accelerating [[privatisation]], and pursuing structural reforms. Both governments failed to implement sound social policies.
The economy really took off between 2003 and 2008 and growth figures quickly shot up, fluctuating between figures as high as 6.6% (2004) and 5.0% (2003). Even in the last pre-crisis year, 2008, the Bulgarian economy was growing rapidly at 6.0%, despite significantly slowing down in the last quarter.

=== Part of the European Union===
On 1 January 2007 [[Bulgaria]] entered the [[European Union]]. This led to some immediate international trade liberalization, but there was no shock to the economy. The government is running annual surpluses of above 3%. This fact, together with annual GDP growth of above 5%, has brought the government indebtedness to 22.8% of GDP in 2006 from 67.3% five years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Hard Road Towards the Euro, Capital Newspaper&quot;&gt;

The [[Bulgarian government]] plans for the [[Euro]] to replace the [[Lev]] in 2010. However, experts predict that this might happen as late as in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capital.bg/showimg.php?filename=oo_330697.jpg] List of projections for year of accession to the Monetary Union&lt;/ref&gt; From a political point of view, there is a trade-off between Bulgaria's economic growth and the stability required for early accession to the [[monetary union]]. Bulgaria's per-capita [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[GDP]] is still only about a third of the [[EU25]] average, while the country's [[nominal GDP]] per capita is about 13% of the EU25 average.

===Economic downturn following the international financial crisis===

[[Image:Public and Private Foreign Debt for Bulgaria 1996-2007 .gif|right|thumb|Public (dark red) vs. private (light red) foreign debt (red line)]]
The country suffered a difficult start to 2009, after gas supplies were cut in the [[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes#Dispute_of_2008.E2.80.932009|Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]]. Industrial output suffered, as well as public services, exposing Bulgaria being overdependent on Russia for raw materials.
The [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global financial crisis]] started to apply downward pressure on growth and employment in the last quarter of 2008. The real estate market, although not plummeting, ground to a halt and growth is expected to be significantly lower in the short-to-medium run.

During the course of 2009, the grim forecasts for the effects of the global crisis on the Bulgarian economy largely materialized. Although suffering less than the worst-hit countries, Bulgaria recorded its worst economic results since the 1997 meltdown. GDP shrank by around 5% and unemployment jumped. Consumer spending and foreign investment dropped dramatically and depressed growth in 2010 to 0.3%. Unemployment remains stubbornly high around 10%.

The government of [[Boiko Borisov]] elected in 2009 undertook steps to restore economic growth, while attempting to maintain a strict financial policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=114429 |title=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=114429 |date=March 21, 2010 | publisher =novinite.com | accessdate =16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture, forestry, and fishing===
{{see also|Agriculture in Bulgaria}}
[[Image:Harvester DON IMG 4141.JPG|left|thumb|250px|[[Combine harvester]] near [[Slivnitsa]]. About 43% of Bulgaria's land is arable.]]
[[Image:Sheep at watering place in Bulgaria.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A flock of [[sheep]] near [[Burgas]]. Bulgaria is the world's 13th largest [[sheep milk]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html?lang=en&amp;country=27&amp;year=2005 FAO - Bulgaria country rank]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the communist era, Bulgaria’s agriculture was heavily centralized, integrated with agriculture-related industries, and state-run. In the postcommunist era, the process of restoring agricultural land to private owners in a form that ensures productivity has been slow. Bank investment and insecurity in the land market contributed to slow development in the 1990s. By 2004 some 98 percent of the workforce and output of Bulgaria’s agricultural sector was private, including a number of large private cooperative enterprises. A significant amount of food also is produced for direct consumption by non-farmers on small plots, which are an important support for parts of the population. In 2000 and 2003, droughts limited agricultural production, and floods had the same effect in 2005. Bulgaria’s main field crops are wheat, corn, and barley. The main industrial crops are sugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are the most important vegetable exports. Production of apples and grapes, Bulgaria’s largest fruit products, has decreased since the communist era, but the export of wine has increased significantly. The most important types of livestock are cattle, sheep, poultry, pigs, and buffaloes, and the main dairy products are yogurt, cow and sheep cheese.&lt;ref name=cp9&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 an estimated one-third of Bulgaria’s land mass was covered by forests, of which about 40 percent was conifers. Between 1980 and 2000, the forested area increased by 4.6 percent. In 2002 a total of 4,800 tons of timber was harvested, 44 percent of which was fuel wood and 20 percent, pulpwood. Although nominal state timber standards are very strict, in 2004 an estimated 45 percent of Bulgaria’s timber harvest was logged illegally because of corruption in the forest service. Some 7.5 percent of forests are protected from all uses, and 65 percent are designated for ecological and commercial use. In 2005 about 70 percent of the total forest resource was rated economically viable.&lt;ref name=cp9/&gt;

Since Bulgaria stopped high-seas fishing in 1995, the country has imported increasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon) has expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the Black Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase the take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased sharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic markets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, Bulgaria’s total fish harvest, wild and cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the harvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.&lt;ref name=cp10&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the most important crops (according to the [[FAO]]) in 2006 (in '000 tons) amounted to: [[wheat]] 3301.9; [[sunflower]] 1196.6; [[maize]] 1587.8; [[grapes]] 266.2; [[tobacco]] 42.0; [[tomato]]es 213.0; [[barley]] 546.3; [[potato]]es 386.1; [[Capsicum|peppers]] 156.7; [[cucumber]]s 61.5; [[cherries]] 18.2; [[watermelon]]s 136.0; [[cabbage]] 72.7; [[apple]]s 26.1; [[plums]] 18.0; [[strawberries]] 8.8.

===Mining and minerals===
Bulgaria’s mining industry has declined in the post-communist era. Many deposits have remained underdeveloped because of a lack of modern equipment and low funding. Mining has contributed less than 2 percent of GDP and engaged less than 3 percent of the workforce in the early 2000s. Bulgaria has the following estimated deposits of metallic minerals: 207 million tons of iron ore, 127 million tons of manganese ore, 936 million tons of copper ore, 238 million tons of chromium ore, and 150 million tons of gold ore. Several of Bulgaria’s minerals are extracted commercially; 80 percent of mining is done by open-pit excavation. Iron extraction at Kremikovtsi and elsewhere is not sufficient to support the domestic steel industry, but copper, lead, and zinc deposits fully supply the nonferrous metallurgy industries. A British firm has exploratory gold mines at Dikanyite and Gornoseltsi, and a domestic copper and gold mine operates at Chelopech. About 50 nonmetallic minerals are present in significant amounts. Substantial amounts of uranium are present in the Rhodope Mountains, but no extraction has occurred in the last 10 years.&lt;ref name=cp10/&gt;

Despite the poor performance of the mining sector, productivity has increased in recent years. Mining remains one of the most important sources of export earnings and is still a significant contributor to economic growth. The mining industry is worth $760 mln,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=118689 Future of Bulgarian Mining Industry Looks Bright], novinite.com, 30 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2010 Bulgaria ranks as the 19th largest [[coal]] producer in the world,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[List of countries by coal production]].''&lt;/ref&gt; 9th largest [[bismuth]] producer,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[List of countries by bismuth production]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 19th largest [[copper]] producer,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[List of countries by copper mine production]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the 26th largest [[zinc]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[List of countries by zinc production]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Elatsite&quot; copper mine and reprocessing facility, built during [[Vulko Chervenkov]]'s rule, takes its place as one of the largest in South-Eastern Europe. It extracts 13 million tonnes of ore annually, producing about 42,000 tonnes of [[copper]], 1.6 tonnes of [[gold]] and 5.5 tonnes of [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotechmin.com/bg/elacite-med/ Елаците-Мед АД], Geotechmin group&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrous [[metallurgy]] has major importance. Much of the production of [[steel]] and [[pig iron]] takes place in [[Kremikovtsi]] and [[Pernik]], with a third metallurgical base in [[Debelt]]. In production of steel and steel products per capita the country heads the [[Balkans]]. {{As of | 2009}} the fate of Kremikovtsi steel factories has come under debate because of serious pollution in the capital, Sofia.

The largest refineries for [[lead]] and [[zinc]] operate in [[Plovdiv]] (the biggest refinery between Italy and the Ural mountains), [[Kardzhali]] and [[Novi Iskar]]; for [[copper]] in [[Pirdop]] and [[Eliseina]] (now defunct); for [[aluminium]] in [[Shumen]]. In production of many metals ''per capita'', such as zinc and iron, Bulgaria ranks first in [[Eastern Europe]].

===Industry and construction===
{{main|Industry of Bulgaria}}
Much of Bulgaria’s communist-era industry was heavy industry, although biochemicals and computers were significant products beginning in the 1980s. Because Bulgarian industry was configured to Soviet markets, the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused a severe crisis in the 1990s. After showing its first growth since the communist era in 2000, Bulgaria’s industrial sector has grown slowly but steadily in the early 2000s. The performance of individual manufacturing industries has been uneven, however. Food processing and tobacco processing suffered from the loss of Soviet markets and have not maintained standards high enough to compete in Western Europe. Textile processing generally has declined since the mid-1990s, although clothing exports have grown steadily since 2000.&lt;ref name=cp10/&gt;

[[File:VRZ Wagon Frame.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A steel frame for a new railway car, [[VRZ Karlovo|Karlovo railworks]]. Bulgaria's largest railcar factories are located in [[Dryanovo]], [[Karlovo]] and [[Septemvri]].]]

Oil refining survived the shocks of the 1990s because of a continuing export market and the purchase of the Burgas refinery by the Russian oil giant LUKoil. The chemical industry has remained in good overall condition but is subject to fluctuating natural gas prices. Growth in ferrous metallurgy, which is dominated by the Kremikovtsi Metals Combine, has been delayed by a complex privatization process and by obsolete capital equipment. Non-ferrous metallurgy has prospered because the Pirdop copper smelting plant was bought by Union Minière of Belgium and because export markets have been favourable.&lt;ref name=cp10/&gt;

The end of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the loss of Third World markets were grave blows to the defence industry. In the early 2000s, the industry’s plan for survival has included upgrading products to satisfy Western markets and doing cooperative manufacturing with Russian
companies. The electronics industry, which also was configured in the 1980s to serve Soviet markets, has not been able to compete with Western computer manufacturers. The industry now relies on contract agreements with European firms and attracting foreign investment. The automotive industry has ceased the manufacture of cars, trucks, and buses. Manufacture of forklifts, a speciality in the communist era, also has stopped. In the early 2000s, shipbuilding has prospered at the major Varna and Ruse yards because of foreign ownership (Ruse) and privatization (Varna).&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in recent years electronics and electric equipment production has regained higher levels. The largest centres include [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]] and the surrounding area, [[Botevgrad]], [[Stara Zagora]], [[Varna]], [[Pravets]] and many other cities. [[Household appliance]]s, [[computer]]s, [[CD]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[medical equipment|medical]] and scientific equipment are being produced.

Many factories producing [[transportation]] equipment {{As of|2008|alt= currently}} still do not operate at full capacity. Plants produce [[train]]s ([[Burgas]], [[Dryanovo]]), [[tram]]s ([[Sofia]]), [[tram|trolley]]s ([[Dupnitsa]]), [[bus]]es ([[Botevgrad]]), [[truck]]s ([[Shumen]]), [[motor truck]]s (Plovdiv, [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]], Sofia, Lovech). Lovech has an automotive assembly plant. [[Rousse]] serves as the main centre for agricultural machinery. Bulgarian arms production mainly operates in central Bulgaria ([[Kazanlak]], [[Sopot]], [[Karlovo]]).

Construction output fell dramatically in the 1990s as industrial and housing construction declined, but a recovery began in the early 2000s. The sector, now dominated by private firms, has resumed the foreign building programs that led to prosperity in the communist era. The Glavbolgostroy firm has major building projects in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine as well as domestic contracts.&lt;ref name=cp11&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
{{main|Energy in Bulgaria|List of power stations in Bulgaria}}
[[File:Bobov Dol Power Plant.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bobov dol thermal power station.]]

Bulgaria relies on imported oil and natural gas (most of which comes from Russia), together with domestic generation of electricity from coal-powered plants and the Kozloduy nuclear plant. The economy remains energy-intensive because conservation practices have developed slowly. The country is a major regional electricity producer. Bulgaria produced 38.07&amp;nbsp;billion kWh of electricity in 2006&lt;ref name=Photius&gt;
Photius.com, [http://www.photius.com/rankings/economy/electricity_production_2006_0.html Electricity production as of 2006]
&lt;/ref&gt;
(in comparison, [[Romania]], which has a population nearly three times larger than Bulgaria, produced 51.7 billion kW·h&lt;ref name=Photius/&gt; in the same year). The domestic power-generating industry, which was privatized in 2004 by sales to interests from Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States, suffers from obsolete equipment and a weak oversight agency. To solve the latter problem, in 2008 the government set up a state-owned energy holding-company ([[Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD]]), composed of gas company [[Bulgargaz]], [[Bulgartransgaz]], power company [[NEK EAD]], Electricity System Operator EAD, [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|Kozloduy nuclear power station]], [[Maritsa Iztok Complex|Maritza-Iztok II thermal power station]], the Mini Maritza Iztok (Maritza Iztok mines), and Bulgartel EAD.  The state holds a 100% stake in the holding company.&lt;ref name=novinite&gt;{{cite news

The Kozloduy nuclear plant, which in 2005 supplied more than 40 percent of Bulgaria’s electric power, will play a diminishing role because two of its remaining four reactors (two were closed in 2002) must be closed by 2007 to comply with European Union (EU) standards. Kozloduy, which exported 14 percent of its output in 2006, was expected to cease all exportation in 2007. Construction of the long-delayed Belene nuclear plant resumed in 2006 but will not be complete until at least 2011. Belene, planned in the 1980s but then rejected, was revived by the safety controversy at Kozloduy.&lt;ref name=cp11/&gt;

Oil exploration is ongoing offshore in the Black Sea (the Shabla block) and on the Romanian border, but Bulgaria’s chief oil income is likely to come as a transfer point on east-west and north-south transit lines. Burgas is Bulgaria’s main oil port on the Black Sea. Bulgaria’s largest oil refinery, Neftochim, was purchased by Russian oil giant LUKoil in 1999 and underwent modernization in 2005. Bulgaria’s only significant coal resource is low-quality lignite, mainly from the state-owned Maritsa-Iztok and Bobov Dol complexes and used in local thermoelectric power stations.&lt;ref name=cp11/&gt;

[[Thermal power station]]s (TPPs) provide a significant amount of energy, with most of the capacity concentrated in the [[Maritsa Iztok Complex]]. The largest TPPs include:

* &quot;Maritsa Iztok 2&quot; - '''1,450&amp;nbsp;MW'''
* &quot;[[Varna Power Plant|Varna]]&quot; - '''1,260&amp;nbsp;MW'''
* &quot;Maritsa Iztok 3&quot; - 870&amp;nbsp;MW
* &quot;[[Bobov Dol Power Plant|Bobov Dol]]&quot; - 630&amp;nbsp;MW
* &quot;[[Ruse Iztok Power Plant|Ruse Iztok]]&quot; - 600&amp;nbsp;MW
* &quot;Maritsa Iztok 1&quot; - 500&amp;nbsp;MW

A $1.4 bln. project for the construction of an additional {{nowrap|670 MW}} block for the {{nowrap|500 MW}} [[Maritsa Iztok Complex|Maritza Iztok 1]] Thermal Power Station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alstom.cz/boilers/en/enovinky.html#3 |title=:Alstom.CZ - Power Environment Sector: |publisher=Alstom.cz |date= |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is expected to be completed by the middle of 2010.

Bulgaria ranks as a minor oil producer (97th in the world) with a total production of 3,520 bbl/day.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
{{see also|Tourism in Bulgaria}}
Although the contribution of services to gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled in the post-communist era, a substantial share of that growth has been in government services, and the qualitative level of services varies greatly. The Bulgarian banking system, which was weak in the first post-communist years, was fully reformed in the late 1990s, including stronger oversight from the National Bank of Bulgaria and gradual privatisation. In 2003 the banking system was fully privatised, and substantial consolidation began making the system more efficient in 2004. Several smaller banks grew substantially between 2004 and 2006. These processes increased public confidence in the banks. Although the system still requires consolidation, loan activity to individuals and businesses increased in the early 2000s. The insurance industry has grown rapidly since a market reform in 1997, with the help of foreign firms. An example is the Bulgarian Insurance Group (BIG), a pension-fund and insurance management company owned by the Dutch-Israeli TBI Holding Company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The introduction of health and pension insurance plans has expanded the private insurance industry. A series of reform laws in the early 2000s enabled the Bulgarian Stock Exchange to begin regular operation. As of 2005, stock market activity was limited by lack of transparency, although the growth rate increased beginning in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a decline in the 1990s, in the early 2000s the tourism industry has grown rapidly. In 2004 some 4 million foreigners visited Bulgaria, compared with 2.3 million in 2000. This trend is based on a number of attractive destinations, low costs, and restoration of facilities. Most of the industry had been privatised by 2004. Infrastructure items such as recreation facilities and booking services require improvement. Development of Bulgaria’s retail sales sector was slow until the early 2000s, when a large number of Western-style outlets began to appear, and Sofia developed as a retail center. By 2006 several major European retail chains had opened stores, and others planned to enter the Bulgarian market.&lt;ref name=cp12&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria has attracted considerable investment from foreigners buying property either for their own use or for investment.  In 2006, more than 29% of property deals were signed by foreigners, more than half of whom were UK citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.propertywisebulgaria.com/article/brits-form-the-majority-of-bulgarias--foreign-property-buyers/id_347/catid_12&lt;/ref&gt;  Various companies, such as [[Bulgarian Dreams]], actively marketed Bulgarian properties to buyers overseas.

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Bulgaria}}

[[File:Goldstrand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Golden Sands]]]]

In 2007 Bulgaria was visited by 5,200,000 tourists, ranking 39th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[World Tourism rankings]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists from Greece, Romania and Germany account for 40% of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourism.government.bg/bg/stat.php?menuid=3&amp;id=3 Statistics from the Bulgarian Tourism Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant numbers of [[British people|British]] (+300,000), [[Russians|Russian]] (+200,000), [[Serbs|Serbian]] (+150,000), [[Poles|Polish]] (+130,000) and [[Danes|Danish]] (+100,000) tourists also visit Bulgaria. Most of them are attracted by the varying and beautiful landscapes, well-preserved historical and cultural heritage, and the tranquility of rural and mountain areas.

Main destinations include the capital [[Sofia]], coastal resorts [[Albena]], [[Sozopol]], [[Sveti Vlas]]; winter resorts [[Pamporovo]], [[Chepelare]] and [[Borovetz]]. [[Arbanasi]] and [[Bozhentsi]] are rural tourist destinations with well-preserved ethnographic traditions. Other popular attractions are the 10th century [[Rila Monastery]] and the 19th century [[Euxinograd]] [[château]].

==Labour==
In 2005 the labour force was estimated at 3.3 million; in 2004, 11 percent worked in agriculture, 33 percent in industry, and 56 percent in services. The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-communist era, reaching a high point of 19 percent in 2000. Since then, the rate has decreased substantially with the creation of new jobs in private and state enterprises. In 2005 the official figure was 11.5 percent, compared with 16.9 percent at the end of 2002. However, in 2003 an estimated 500,000 Bulgarians were unemployed but not officially counted because they were not seeking work. In January 2005, the government raised the minimum wage by 25 percent, to US$90 per month. The largest labour unions are Podkrepa (Support) and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. They represent labour in the National Council for Tripartite Partnership, in which they join government and business representatives to discuss issues of labour, social security, and living standards. The unions were an important political force in the fall of the Zhivkov regime.&lt;ref name=cp12/&gt;

==Currency and inflation==
{{see also|Bulgaria and the euro}}
[[File:BGMoney.JPG|thumb|230px|Banknotes of 5, 20 and 50 leva]]

Bulgaria’s unit of currency is the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]] (pl., leva). In October 2006, the U.S. dollar was worth 1.57 leva. In 1999 the value of the lev was pegged to that of the German deutsch-mark, which was replaced by the euro in 2001. Following Bulgaria’s  admission to the European Union, the lev is scheduled to be replaced by the euro.&lt;ref name=cp14&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Bulgaria’s inflation rate was estimated at between 2.3 and 3 percent. The rate was 6 percent in 2004 and 5 percent in 2005.&lt;ref name=cp9/&gt;

==Taxation and government budget==
As of 1 January 2008 the [[income tax]] for all citizens is set to a flat rate of 10%. This [[flat tax]] is one of the lowest income rates in the world and the lowest income rate in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/12/17/bulgaria-now-an-official-member-of-the-flat-tax-club/&lt;/ref&gt; The reform was done in hope for higher GDP growth and greater tax collection rates. Some called it a &quot;revolution&quot; in taxation, but the changes were met with mild discussions and some protests by affected working classes. The proposal was modified to allow for compensating the perceived losers from the changes in the tax formula. The [[corporate income tax]] is also 10% as of 1 January 2007 which is also among the lowest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eubusiness.com/Bulgaria/1191900721.97/&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2005 Bulgaria’s estimated state revenues totaled US$11.2 billion, and its estimated state expenditures, including capital expenditures, were US$10.9 billion, yielding a surplus of US$300 million. In 2004 revenues totaled US$10.1 billion and expenditures US$9.7 billion, for a surplus of US$400 million.&lt;ref name=cp9/&gt;

==Foreign economic relations==
In the 1990s, Bulgaria moved gradually away from dependence on markets in the former Soviet sphere, increasing its exports to the European Union (EU). In 1999 Bulgaria joined the Central European Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA), with whose members (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia; Macedonia was added in 2006) it has established important trade relations. The admission of all but Croatia and Romania to the EU in 2004 reduced the significance of CEFTA trade, however. In 2004 some 54 percent of Bulgaria’s import trade and 58 percent of its export trade was with EU member countries. Bulgaria has bilateral free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, and Turkey.&lt;ref name=cp12/&gt;

In the early 2000s, hydrocarbon fuels remained an important import, although beginning in the late 1990s those commodities’ share of total imports decreased significantly, from 29 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 2004. During that period, the diversification of imported products
improved as the volume of machinery and equipment, consumer products, and automobiles increased. A large percentage of imports is accounted for by raw materials such as cloth, metal ore, and petroleum, which are processed and re-exported. The most important imports in 2005 were machinery and equipment, metals and ores, chemicals and plastics, fuels, and minerals. The major sources of imports, in order of volume, were Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Greece. In 2005 Bulgaria’s largest export markets, in order of volume, were Italy, Germany, Turkey,
Greece, and Belgium. The most important export commodities were clothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and fuels. In 2005 Bulgaria’s exports totaled US$11.7 billion and its imports totaled US$15.9 billion, incurring a trade deficit of US$4.2 billion. The trade deficit is especially severe with Russia, where markets for Bulgarian goods have shrunk drastically in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of 2006, Bulgaria had a current account deficit of US$2.3 billion, a substantial increase over the deficit for the same period of 2005, which was some US$1.4 billion. Its trade deficit was US$2.78 billion, foreign direct investment totaled US$1.8 billion, and the financial account balance was US$2.29 billion. In mid-2006 the overall balance of payments was US$883 million, compared with US$755 million for the same period of 2005.&lt;ref name=cp13&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria’s large foreign debt has been an economic burden throughout the postcommunist era. At the end of 2005, Bulgaria reported an external debt of US$15.2 billion, an increase in value but a decrease as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 2002 and previous years. As a percentage of GDP, the external debt remained constant between 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref name=cp13/&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s, investment from the West and from Russia has contributed significantly to recovery from the economic crisis of 1996–97, but the rate of investment has remained lower than that in other countries of Eastern Europe. In 2003 the largest national sources of foreign direct investment, in order of volume, were Austria, Greece, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1997 the Belgian Solve company bought the Deny Soda Combine, and in 1999 LUKoil of Russia bought the Neftochim Oil Refinery at Burgas. Union Minière, a Belgian mining company, bought the large Pirdop copper-smelting plant, giving an important boost to Bulgarian nonferrous metallurgy. A number of foreign companies have invested in the chemical fertilizer and food-processing industries In the early 2000s, China invested in the Bulgarian electronics industry. Some cooperative agreements have been made for manufacture of vehicle components. Daimler-Chrysler of Germany has a contract to update Bulgaria’s military transport vehicles between 2003 and 2015. The French Eurocopter company has a bilateral protocol involving a variety of machinery, computer software, and other industrial products. In 2004 Bulgarian oil reserves attracted interest from Melrose Resources of Edinburgh. Russia’s natural gas giant, Gazprom, has pledged investment in Bulgaria’s natural gas infrastructure in exchange for increased purchase of its product. A three-company Israeli consortium agreed in 2004 to work with the domestic Overgas company (which is half-owned by Gazprom) on a major natural-gas distribution network in Bulgaria. In 2005 three European consortia submitted bids for construction of the Belene nuclear power plant. One such investor is the Italian ENEL energy consortium, which also owns the Maritsa–Iztok–3 thermal power plant. In 2006 Russia’s Gazprom company bid against several European energy companies for ownership of newly privatized regional heating utilities, and the Austrian Petromaxx Energy Group invested US$120 million in a new oil refinery at Silistra.&lt;ref name=cp13/&gt;

In December 1996, Bulgaria joined the [[World Trade Organization]]. In the early 90's Bulgaria's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept foreign investment among the lowest in the region. Total direct foreign investment from 1991 through 1996 was $831 million. In the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone over 2.72 billion Euro (3.47 billion US dollars) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005 economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euros (2.3 billion US dollars) in [[FDI]] which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies. After joining the EU in 2007 Bulgaria registered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 billion euros.

==Railways==

[[Image:BGrailroads-en.png|right|thumb|350px|Map of Bulgaria's railroad network]]
{{See also|Bulgarian State Railways}}
In 2005 Bulgaria had some 6,238 kilometers of open access track owned by the state company &quot;National Company Railway Infrastructure&quot;, including a 125 kilometers long 760&amp;nbsp;mm narrow gauge railway - the [[Septemvri-Dobrinishte narrow gauge line]]&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt;. Sofia, Plovdiv and Gorna Oriahovitsa are the hubs of the domestic system and of international rail connections &lt;ref name=cp14/&gt;. 

Bulgaria's rail system has not expanded since the 1980s, but there are upgrading projects underway &lt;ref name=cp14&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;. Current top operating speed is 130&amp;nbsp;km/h, with the national top speed record is 197&amp;nbsp;km/h set between Iskar and Elin Pelin with a leased [[Siemens]] Taurus electric locomotive. The top operating speed is soon to be increased to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h after the completion of the [[Krumovo]] - [[Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria|Dimitrovgrad]] - [[Svilengrad]] electrification and upgrading. There are also plans for upgrading for high speed operation and doubling (where needed) of the [[Plovdiv]] - [[Burgas]] railway. 

In the mid-2000s, railways remained a major mode of freight transportation, but with increasing problems with the maintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds, highways carried a progressively larger share of freight.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; The national passenger and freight operator is called [[Bulgarian State Railways]], but there are also a number of private operators including Bulgarian Railway Company and [[DB Schenker]] Rail Bulgaria.

===Sofia Metro===
In 1998 the first six kilometers of an often-interrupted 52-kilometer standard gauge subway project ([[Sofia Metro]]) opened in Sofia.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; Additional stations were opened recently and with the last one that opened on the 7th of September 2009, the subway reached total length of 18 kilometers with 14 stations. Construction of the second line started in December 2008, which is due to be opened according to initial forecasts by the end of 2012.{{Update after|2010|11|13}}&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt;

==Roads==
In the early 2000s, Bulgaria had some 37,300 kilometers of roads, all but 3,000 of which were paved but nearly half of which (18,000 kilometers) fell into the lowest international rating for paved roads. Only 324 kilometers of high-speed highways were in service in 2005. Roads have overtaken the railroads as the chief mode of freight transportation. Long-term plans call for upgrading higher-quality roads and integrating the road system into the European grid. The focus is on improving road connectors with Turkey and Greece and domestic connections linking Sofia, Plovdiv, and Burgas. Bulgaria has delayed building some key highway connections since the 1990s, but European Union membership is a strong incentive for completion. The National Strategy for Integrated Infrastructure Development calls for construction of 720 kilometers of new highways by 2015. A 114-kilometer link between eastern Bulgaria and the Turkish border is scheduled for completion in 2010. As of 2004, two international highways passed through Bulgaria, and a major highway ran from Sofia to the Black Sea coast. Proposed international corridors would pass from north to south, from Vidin to the border with Greece and from Ruse to the border with Greece, and west to east, from Serbia through Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Edirne (Turkey). A new bridge link with Romania is scheduled for completion in 2011, relieving road and railroad congestion in that direction.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt;

==Aviation==
[[Image:100 3107.JPG|280px|right|thumb|Sofia's international airport]]
{{See also|List of airports in Bulgaria|List of airlines of Bulgaria}}
Compared with road and railroad transport, aviation used to be a minor mode of freight movement, and only 860,000 passengers used Bulgarian airlines in 2001.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; In 2008 Bulgaria had 204 airports, 127 of which had paved runways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bu.html CIA World Factbook Bulgaria]&lt;/ref&gt; One airport, [[Sofia Airport]], had a runway longer than 3,000 meters, and there were four heliports.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; The second- and third-largest airports, [[Varna Airport]] and [[Burgas Airport]], serve mainly charter flights and have regular domestic links with the capital.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; In the early 2000s, Sofia Airport received substantial renovation, with aid from a [[Kuwait]]i-led consortium, in anticipation of increased air connections with Europe.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; A three-phase expansion was scheduled for completion in 2010.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; The communist-era state airline, [[Balkan Airlines]], was replaced by [[Bulgaria Air]], for which a private owner was to be selected from among bidders by the end of 2006.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}} In 2005 Bulgaria Air transported 517,000 passengers to international destinations, including all major European cities&lt;ref name=cp15&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the second terminal of International Airport Sofia was built the total number of passengers rose and reached 3 230 696 in 2008.

==Timetables==
Civil transportation is well developed in Bulgaria. There are several big companies, which control the market and hundreds of small (one bus = one company), which operate between the smaller towns. The main problem with so many companies is how to find their timetables. Recently the project &quot;bgrazpisanie&quot; (BG timetable in English) succeeded to collect all Bulgarian civil transportation timetables on its website www.BGrazpisanie.com [http://bgrazpisanie.com]

==Waterways==
*470&amp;nbsp;km (2006); major river is [[Danube]] and also includes [[Maritsa]] and [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]].

==Pipelines==
In 2005 Bulgaria had 2,425 kilometers of natural gas pipelines, 339 kilometers of oil pipelines, and 156 kilometers of pipelines for refined products.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; The pipeline system was scheduled for substantial changes and additions, however.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; The 279-kilometer Burgas-Alexandroupolis Pipeline, still under negotiation among Bulgaria, Greece, and Russia in 2006, would provide a bypass of the overloaded Bosporus Strait.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; The line would enable Russian oil arriving at the Bulgarian oil port of Burgas to reach Greece’s Mediterranean port at Alexandroupolis.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; A 900-kilometer U.S.- financed alternate route, known as the AMBO pipeline, would bring oil from Burgas across Bulgaria and Macedonia to the Albanian port of Vlore on the Adriatic Sea, bypassing both the Bosporus and Greece.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; As of October 2006, approval of both pipelines was expected.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}} With international investment, Bulgaria began constructing a new domestic gas transportation network beginning in 2005.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; The Russian Gazprom company planned a gas pipeline from Dimitrovgrad in eastern Bulgaria across Serbia, reaching the Adriatic Sea in Croatia.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; Some 400 kilometers of the planned Nabucco pipeline, bringing gas from Azerbaijan and Iran to Central Europe, were to cross Bulgaria sometime before 2011.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt;

==Ports and harbours==
===River ports===
[[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]], [[Rousse]], [[Vidin]], [[Silistra]], [[Tutrakan]], [[Svishtov]], [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] and[[Oryahovo]] are river ports on the [[Danube]] river.

The '''Military of Bulgaria''', officially the '''Bulgarian Army''' ({{lang-bg|Българска армия}}) represents the Armed Forces of the [[Republic of Bulgaria]]. The Commander-in-Chief is the [[President of Bulgaria]] (currently [[Georgi Parvanov]]). The Ministry of Defence is in charge of political leadership while military command remains in the hands of the General Staff, headed by the Chief of Staff. There are three main branches - the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.

Throughout history, the army has played a major role in defending the country's [[sovereignty]]. Only several years after its liberation (1878), Bulgaria became a regional military power and was involved in several major wars - [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885), [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13), [[Second Balkan War]] (1913), [[First World War]] (1915–1919) and [[Second World War]] (1941–1944), during which the Army gained significant combat experience. During the Cold War the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] maintained one of the largest militaries in the [[Warsaw Pact]], numbering an estimated 152,000 troops in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0216) Bulgaria - Military Personnel]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Fall of Communism]], the country's political leadership decided to pursue a pro-[[NATO]] policy, thus reducing military personnel and weaponry. Bulgaria joined the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004, and currently maintains a total 776 deployed troops in three countries.

The [[patron saint]] of the Bulgarian Army is [[St. George]]. The Army day or [[St. George's Day]] (6 May) is an official holiday in the country.

==History of the Bulgarian Army==
{{main|Opalchentsi}}
[[Image:Mihail ganchev captain.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Bulgarian [[militia]]men from the region of Macedonia, ca. 1900]]
The modern Bulgarian military dates back to 1878. On 22 July 1878 (10 July O.S.) a total of 12 battalions of ''[[opalchentsi]]'' who participated in the Liberation war, formed the Bulgarian armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;'''Попов''', '''В.''', '''Иванова''', '''Ц.''', '''Велкова''', '''Й.''' ''Българската земска войска 1878-1879 г.'', София, 1959, Държавно Военно Издателство, с. 60&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Tarnovo Constitution]], all men between 21 and 40 years of age were eligible for military service. In 1883 the military was reorganized in four infantry [[brigades]] (in Sofia, Pleven, Ruse and Shumen) and one cavalry [[brigade]].

===Serbo-Bulgarian war===
{{main|Serbo-Bulgarian War}}
The Serbo-Bulgarian War was the first armed conflict after [[Liberation of Bulgaria|Bulgaria's liberation]]. It was a result of the [[Bulgarian unification|unification]] with [[Eastern Rumelia]], which happened on September 6, 1885. The unification was not completely recognized, however, and one of the countries which refused to recognize the act was the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] had been expanding its influence in the [[Balkans]] and was particularly opposed. Serbia also feared this would diminish its dominance in the region. In addition, Serbia's ruler [[Milan Obrenović IV]] was annoyed that Serbian opposition leaders like [[Nikola Pašić]], who had escaped persecution after the [[Timok Rebellion]], had found asylum in Bulgaria. Lured by Austria-Hungary's promises for territorial gains from Bulgaria (in return for concessions in the Western Balkans), Milan IV declared war on Bulgaria on November 14, 1885. 

The military strategy relied largely on surprise, as Bulgaria had moved most of its troops near the border with the Ottoman Empire, in the southeast. As it happened, the Ottomans did not intervene and the Serbian army's advance was stopped after the [[Battle of Slivnitsa]]. The main body of the Bulgarian army traveled from the Ottoman border in the southeast to the Serbian border in the northwest to defend the capital [[Sofia]]. After the defensive battles at Slivnitsa and [[Vidin]], Bulgaria began an offensive which took the city of [[Pirot]]. At this point, the Austro-Hungarian Empire stepped in, threatening to join the war on Serbia's side if the Bulgarian troops did not retreat. Fighting lasted for only 14 days, from November 14 to November 28. A peace treaty was signed in [[Bucharest]] on February 19, 1886. No territorial changes were made to either country, but the Bulgarian unification was recognized by the Great Powers. However, the relationship of trust and friendship between Serbia and Bulgaria, built during their long common fight against Ottoman rule, suffered irreparable damage.

===First Balkan War===
{{main|First Balkan War}}
[[File:Bulgarian soldiers of the Balkan Wars.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bulgarian soldiers of the Balkan Wars, painting by the French war artist [[Georges Scott]]]]
The instability in the Balkan region in the early [[1900s (decade)|1900s]] quickly became a precondition for a new war. Serbia's aspirations towards [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were thwarted by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] annexation of the province in October 1908, and so the Serbs focused their attention onto their historic cradle, [[Kosovo]] and to the south for expansion. Greek officers, [[Goudi coup|revolting]] in August 1909, had secured the appointment of a progressive government under [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] which they hoped would resolve the [[History of Crete#Modern Crete|Cretan issue]] in Greece's favour and reverse their [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|defeat of 1897 by the Ottomans]]. Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia, also looked to districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia for expansion. 

In March 1910, an [[Albanians|Albanian]] insurrection broke out in Kosovo. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom. In 1911, [[Italy]] launched an [[Italo-Turkish War|invasion of Tripolitania]], which was quickly followed by the occupation of the [[Dodecanese]] Islands. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire greatly influenced the Balkan states to prepare for war against Turkey. Thus in the spring of 1912, consultations between the various Christian Balkan nations resulted in a network of military alliances which became known as the [[Balkan League]]. The Great Powers, most notably France and Austria-Hungary, reacted to this diplomatic sensation by trying to dissuade the League from going to war, but failed. 

In late September, both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. Montenegro was the first to declare war, on September 25 ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/ October 8. The other three states, after issuing an impossible ultimatum to the Porte on October 13, declared war on Turkey on October 17. The Balkan League relied on 700,000 troops, 370,000 of which were Bulgarians. Bulgaria, often dubbed &quot;[[Prussia]] of the Balkans&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/4/4/7/14477/14477-h/14477-h.htm Emile Joseph Dillon, &quot;''The Inside Story of the Peace Conference''&quot;, Ch. XV]&lt;/ref&gt; was militarily the most powerful of the four states, with a large, well-trained and well-equipped army.&lt;ref name=Hall16&gt;Hall (2000), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The peacetime army of 60,000 men was expanded during the war to 370,000,&lt;ref name=Hall16&gt;Hall (2000), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; with almost 600,000 men mobilized in total, out of a population of 4,300,000.&lt;ref name=Hall18&gt;Hall (2000), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian field army counted for 9 infantry divisions, 1 cavalry division and 1,116 artillery units.&lt;ref name=Hall16&gt;Hall (2000), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Commander-in-Chief was [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Tsar Ferdinand]], while the actual command was in the hands of his deputy, General Mikhail Savov. The Bulgarians also possessed a small navy of six torpedo boats, which were restricted to operations along the country's [[Black Sea]] coast.&lt;ref name=Hall17&gt;Hall (2000), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Soldiers preparing for an assault against [[Adrianople]], 1912]]
Bulgaria's war aims were focused on [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. For the latter Bulgaria had a secret agreement with Serbia to divide it between them signed at 13 March 1912 during the negotiations that led to the establishment of the Balkan League. But it was not a secret that Bulgaria's target was the fulfilment of the never materialized [[Treaty of San Stefano]] signed after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]]. They deployed their main force in Thrace, forming three armies. The [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]], under general [[Vasil Kutinchev]] with 3 infantry divisions, was deployed to the south of [[Yambol]], with direction of operations along the [[Tundzha]] river. The [[Second Army(Bulgaria)|Second Army]], under general [[Nikola Ivanov]], with 2 infantry divisions and 1 infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianopel (now [[Edirne]]). According to the plans, the [[Third Army(Bulgaria)|Third Army]], under general [[Radko Dimitriev]], was deployed east of and behind the First, and was covered by the cavalry division hiding it from the Turkish view. The Third Army had 3 infantry divisions and was assigned to cross the Stranja mountain and to take the fortress of Lozengrad ([[Kirk Kilisse]]). The 2nd and 7th divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in [[Western Thrace]] and eastern Macedonia respectively. 

The first great battles were at the [[Adrianople]] - [[Kirk Kilisse]] defensive line, where the Bulgarian 1st and 3rd Armies (together 110,000 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (130,000 men) near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The fortress of [[Adrianople]] was [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|besieged]] and [[Battle of Kirk Kelesse|Kirk Kilisse was taken]] without resistance under the pressure of the Bulgarian Third Army. The initial Bulgarian attack by First and Third Army defeated the Turkish forces, numbering some 130,000, and reached the [[Sea of Marmara]]. But the Turks, with the aid of fresh reinforcements from the Asian provinces, established their third and strongest defensive position at the [[Chataldja]] Line, across the peninsula where [[Constantinople]] is located. New Turkish forces landed at [[Bulair]] and [[Şarköy]] but after heavy fighting they were crushed and overthrown by the newly formed 4th Bulgarian army under the command of General [[Stiliyan Kovachev]]. The offensive at [[Chataldja]] failed too. On 11 March, the final Bulgarian [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|assault on Adrianople]] began. Under the command of General [[Georgi Vazov]] the Bulgarians, reinforced with two Serb divisions, conquered the &quot;untakable&quot; city. On 17/30 May a peace treaty was signed between Turkey and the Balkan Alliance. The First Balkan War, which lasted from October 1912 to May 1913, strengthened Bulgaria's position as a regional military power, significantly reduced Ottoman influence over the Balkans, and resulted in the formation of an independent [[Albania|Albanian state]].

===Second Balkan War===
{{main|Second Balkan War}}
[[File:Bulgarian cavalry 1913.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bulgarian cavalry during the Balkan Wars. Painting by Georges Scott]]
The peace settlement of the First Balkan War proved unsatisfactory for both Serbia and Bulgaria. Serbia refused to cede a part of the territories in Macedonia, which it occupied and promised to give to Bulgaria according to a secret agreement. Serbia, on its side, was not satisfied with the independence of [[Albania]], and sought a secret alliance with [[Greece]]. Armed skirmishes between Serbian and Bulgarian troops occurred. 

On June 16, 1913, just a few months after the end of the first war, the Bulgarian government ordered an attack on Serbian and Greek positions in Macedonia, without declaring war. Almost all of Bulgaria's 500,000-man standing army was positioned against these two countries, on two fronts - western and southern, while the borders with [[Romania]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were left almost unguarded. [[Montenegro]] sent a 12,000-strong force to assist the Serbs. Exhausted from the previous war, which took the highest toll on Bulgaria, the Bulgarian army soon turned on the defensive. Romania attacked from the north and north-east, the Ottoman empire also intervened in [[Thrace]]. Allied numerical superiority was almost 2:1. After a month and two days of fighting, the war ended as a moral disaster for Bulgaria, in the same time its economy was ruined and the military - demoralized.

===First World War===
{{main|Bulgaria during World War I}}
[[Image:Bulgarische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Soldiers on their way to the front]]
The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] participated in [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] between 15 October 1915, when the country declared war on [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], to 29 September 1918, when the [[Armistice with Bulgaria|Armistice of Thessalonica]] was signed. In the aftermath of the [[Balkan Wars]], Bulgarian opinion turned against [[Russia]] and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government of [[Vasil Radoslavov]] aligned the country with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as its own. 

In 1915 Germany promised to restore the boundaries according to the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October the same year. In the First World War Bulgaria decisively asserted its military capabilities. The [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|second Battle of Doiran]], with general [[Vladimir Vazov]] as commander, inflicted a heavy blow on the numerically superior [[British army]], which suffered 12,000 casualties against 2,000 from the opposite side. One year later, during the [[Battle of Doiran|third battle of Doiran]], the [[United Kingdom]], supported by [[Greece]], once again suffered a humiliating defeat, losing 3,155 men against just about 500 for the Bulgarian side. The reputation of the [[French army]] also suffered badly. The [[Battle of the Red Wall]] was marked with the total defeat of the French forces, with 5,700 out of 6,000 men killed. The 261 Frenchmen who survived were captured by Bulgarian soldiers. 

Despite the outstanding victories, Germany was near defeat, which meant that Bulgaria would be left without its most powerful ally. The war was already unpopular among Bulgarians themselves, as they were allied with the [[Muslim]] Ottomans against their [[Orthodox Christian]] neighbours. The Agrarian Party leader, [[Aleksandur Stamboliyski]], was imprisoned for his opposition to the war. The [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released and a republic was proclaimed. In 1919 Bulgaria officially left the war with the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]].

===The army between the World Wars===
The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine proved to be a severe blow for Bulgaria's military. According to the treaty, the country had no right to organize a [[conscription]]-based military. The professional army was to be no more than 20,000 men, including internal forces and border guard. Equipping the army with tanks, submarines, bombers and heavy artillery was strictly prohibited, although Bulgaria managed to get around some of these prohibitions. Nevertheless, in the eve of [[World War II]] the Bulgarian army was still well-trained and well-equipped.

===World War II===
{{main|Bulgaria during World War II}}
[[Image:Bundesarchiv N 1603 Bild-152, Sofia, bulgarischer Soldat vor Wachhaus.jpg|thumb|200px|Bulgarian soldier on his post, [[Sofia]], 1942]]
The government of the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] under [[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Bogdan Filov]] declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war; but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains, especially in the lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighbouring countries after the [[Second Balkan War]] and [[World War I]]. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. [[Turkey]] had a [[non-aggression pact]] with Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940, Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating a recovery of [[Southern Dobruja]] in the Axis-sponsored [[Treaty of Craiova]] (see [[Second Vienna Award]]). Southern Dobruja had been part of [[Romania]] since 1913. This recovery of territory reinforced hopes for resolving other territorial problems without direct involvement in the War. The country was forced to join the [[Axis Powers]] in 1941, when [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops preparing to invade [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]] reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through its territory. 

On 1 March 1941, Bulgaria signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] officially joined the Axis bloc. With the [[Soviet Union]] in a [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact with Germany]], there was little popular opposition to the decision. After a short period of inaction, the army launched an operation against [[Yugoslavia]] and Greece. The goal of reaching the shores of the [[Aegean sea]] and completely occupying the region of Macedonia came to success. Even though Bulgaria did not send any troops to support the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], the Navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the [[Soviet Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various resistance groups. The Bulgarian government was forced by the Germans to declare a token war on the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] near the end of 1941, an act which resulted in the [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|bombing of Sofia]] and other Bulgarian cities by [[Allied]] aircraft. 

The German invasion of the Soviet Union caused a significant wave of protests, which led to the activation of a mass guerrilla movement headed by the underground [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. A resistance movement called [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Otechestven front]] (Fatherland front, Bulgarian: Отечествен фронт) was set up in August 1942 by the Communist Party, the [[Zveno]] movement and a number of other parties to oppose the then pro-Nazi government, after a number of Allied victories indicated that the Axis might lose the War. In 1943, tsar [[Boris III]] died suddenly. In the summer of 1944, after having crushed the Nazi defence around [[Iaşi]] and [[Chişinău]], the [[Soviet Army]] was approaching the Balkans and Bulgaria. On 23 August 1944, Romania quit the Axis Powers and declared war on Germany, and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. On 26 August 1944, the Fatherland Front made the decision to incite an armed rebellion against the government, which led to the appointment of a new government on 2 September. Support for the government was withheld by the Fatherland Front, since it was composed of pro-Nazi circles, in a desperate attempt to hold on to power. On 5 September 1944, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and invaded, facing no resistance as the Soviets were perceived as liberators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0054) The Soviet Occupation], Library of Congress Country Studies&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 1944, the Bulgarians changed sides and joined the Soviet Union in its war against Nazi Germany.

===Cold War era===
[[File:Shield 1982 Military Drill.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A commemorative badge of the ''Shield '82'' joint Warsaw Pact exercise in Bulgaria]]

As the [[Red Army]] invaded Bulgaria in 1944&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1832.html&lt;/ref&gt; and installed a [[communist]] government, the armed forces started to rapidly reorganise following the Soviet model, and were re-named as the Bulgarian People's Army (''Bulgarska Narodna Armiya, BNA''). [[Moscow]] quickly supplied Bulgaria with [[T-34/85]] tanks, [[SU-100]] guns, [[Il-2]] attack planes and other new combat machinery. As the country was a Soviet ally, it was apart of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and entered the [[Warsaw Pact]] as one of its founders. By the time the army had expanded to over 200,000 men with hundreds of thousands of more reserve troops. Military service was obligatory. A special [[defensive line]], known as the [[Krali Marko defensive line]], was constructed along the entire border with Turkey. It was heavily fortified with concrete walls and turrets of T-34, [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] tanks. 

The army was involved in a border skirmishes from 1948 to 1952, repulsing several Greek attacks, and took part in the suppression of the [[Prague spring]] events. In the meantime, during the rule of [[Todor Zhivkov]], a significant military industrial complex was established, capable of producing armored vehicles, self-proppelled artillery, small arms and ammunition, as well as aircraft engines and spare parts. Bulgaria provided weapons and military expertise to [[Algeria]], [[Yemen]], [[Libya]], [[Iraq]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. Some military and medical aid was also supplied to [[North Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. During the [[1970s]] the Air Force was at the apogee of its power, possessing at least 500 modern combat aircraft in its inventory. Training in the Bulgarian People's Army was exhaustive even by Soviet standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/cold-war-country-information.cfm?country=Bulgaria&amp;topic=Army Bulgaria - Army], nationalcoldwarexhibition.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, when the [[Cold War]] was coming to its end, the army numbered at least 152,000 regular troops.

===Modern era===
With the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the end of the [[Cold war]], Bulgaria could no longer support a vast military. A rapid reduction in personnel and active equipment was to be carried out in parallel with a general re-alignment of strategic interests. In 1990, Bulgaria had a total of more than 2,400 tanks, 2,000 armored vehicles, 2,500 large caliber artillery systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0208) Ground Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 300 fighter and bomber aircraft, 100 trainer aircraft, more than 40 combat and 40 transport helicopters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0209) Air and Air Defense Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 4 submarine, 6 fast missile craft, 2 frigates, 5 corvettes, 6 torpedo boats, 9 patrol craft, 30 minesweepers and 21 transport vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0210) Naval Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the economic crisis that affected most former Eastern bloc countries, a steady reform in the military could not be carried out; much of the equipment fell into disrepair and some of it was smuggled and sold to the international black market. Inadequate payments, fuel and spare part shortages and the disbandment of many capable units led to an overall drop in combat readiness, morale and discipline. 

After partially recovering from the 1990s crisis, the Bulgarian military became a part of the collective defensive system of [[NATO]]. As its member, Bulgaria sent a total of 485 soldiers to Iraq (2003–2008) as a participant in the [[Iraq War]], and currently maintains a 608-strong force in [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[ISAF]]. [[Bulgaria]] had a significant [[missile]] arsenal, including 67 [[SCUD|SCUD-B]], dozens of [[FROG-7]] and 24 [[SS-23]] ballistic missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN&quot;&gt;[http://www.standartnews.com/archive/2002/08/12/interview/s3453_2.htm StandartNews.com &quot;Никой не разбра, че горихме ракети през 1973 г. (in Bulgarian)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Bulgaria disbanded the [[Bulgarian Rocket Forces|Rocket Forces]] despite nationwide protests, and has disbanded its submarine component. Bulgaria is to have 27,000 standing troops by 2014, consisting of 14,310 troops in the land forces, 6,750 in the air force, 3,510 in the navy and 2,420 in the joint command.&lt;ref&gt;White Paper, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:Armed Forces Bulgaria.png|thumb|right|600px|Structure of the Bulgarian Armed Forces]]

=== General Staff ===
The Bulgarian Armed Forces are Headquartered in [[Sofia]], where most of the general staff is based. Currently headed by Chief of Staff general [[Simeon Simeonov (general)|Simeon Simeonov]], the General Staff is responsible for operational command of the Bulgarian Army and its 3 major branches. Deputies: Vice Admiral Petar Petrov, General Atanas Zaprianov, General Dimitar Zekhtinov.

=== Units and formations ===

In 2010 the Ministry of Defence completed a thorough study of the defence policy and issued a ''White Book'', or a ''White Paper on Defence'', calling for a major overhaul of the structure of Defence Forces. According to the document the military of the Republic of Bulgaria should include two mechanized [[brigade]]s, four [[regiments]] (Logistics, Artillery, Engineering, SpecOps), four [[battalion]]s (Reconnaissance, Mechanized, NBC, PsyOps) in the Land Forces; Fighter base, helicopter base, SAM air defense brigade and Air force training base in the Air Force; and two naval bases in the Navy. Currently deployed units are as follows:

:'''Land Forces''':
* [[2nd Light Infantry Brigade]] (scheduled to be disbanded)
* [[61st Stryamska Mechanized Brigade]]
* [[68th Special Forces Brigade (Bulgaria)|68th Special Forces Brigade]]

* [[5th Shipchenska Infantry Brigade]], the last of the ''Shipchenski'' brigades, has been disbanded in late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standartnews.com/news/details/id/85901/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82-5-%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%A8%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0 Закриват 5-та Шипченска бригада], StandartNews, 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personnel===
[[Image:Bulgarian Army at Novo Selo Training Range.jpg|thumb|250px|Advancing soldiers and IFVs on a drill]]

Bulgaria's total military personnel as of late 2010 is 34,500, of which 30,400 (88.1%) are active military personnel and 4,100 (11.9%) are civilian personnel. The Land Forces are the largest branch, with at least 18,000 men serving there. In terms of percentage, 53% of all Army personnel are in the Land Forces, 25% are in the Air Force, 13% are in the Navy and 9% are in the Joint Forces Command.&lt;ref&gt;White Paper, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Annual spending per soldier amounts to 30,000 leva (~ 15,000 [[euro]]) and is scheduled to increase to 43,600 leva by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;White Paper, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike many former Soviet bloc militaries, [[discipline]] and morale problems are not common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.md.government.bg/bg/20090121.html Конференция на тема: „Роля и място на органите за ръководство при планиране и провеждане на национални и съюзни военни операции на територията на Република България”], January 21, 2009, Ministry of Defense&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgarmy.eu/?action=news&amp;id=11269 Отчитат удовлетворяваща дисциплина във войската], ''Bulgarian Army'', 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the Communist era, the army members enjoyed extensive social privileges. After the fall of Communism and Bulgaria's transition to a [[market economy]], wages fell severely. For almost a decade social benefits were virtually non-existent, and some of them have been restored but recently. [[Nikolai Tsonev]], defence minister under the 2005-2009 cabinet, undertook steps to provide the members of the military and their families with certain privileges in terms of [[healthcare]] and [[education]], and to improve living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitz.bg/news/article/46516 Нови социални придобивки за военните], Blitz.bg, 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
[[Image:M2 Novo Selo 2ndLIF.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Bulgarian trooper fires an [[M2 Browning]] .50 cal machine gun at the Novo Selo training range]]
The Land Forces practice extensive year-round military training in various conditions. Cooperative drills with the [[United States]] are very common, the last series of them conducted in 2008. Joint exercises with other states are rare, though. Bulgaria's most recent full-scale exercise simulating a foreign invasion was carried out in 2009. It was conducted at the [[Koren range]], and included some 1,700 personnel with tanks, ATGMs, attack aircraft, AA guns and armored vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segabg.com/online/new/articlenew.asp?sid=2009041000040001301 Армията влезе в учение от времето на Студената война], segabg.com, 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recent years the Air Force suffered somewhat from fuel shortages; a problem which was overcome in 2008. Fighter pilots have year-round flights, but gunship pilots do not fly often due to the yet unfulfilled modernization of the [[Mi-24]] gunships. Transport aircraft have no flying time problems, however. It is expected the combat helicopters will be modernized about 2009-2010. The Navy also has some fuel shortage problems, but military training is still effective. 

Despite these problems, overall discipline, preparedness, and combat readiness are good.

===Budget===
After the collapse of the Warsaw pact, Bulgaria lost the ability to acquire cheap fuel and spares for its military. A large portion of its nearly 2,000 [[T-55]] tanks fell into disrepair, and eventually almost all of them were scrapped or sold to other countries. In the early [[1990s]] the budget was so small, that regulars only received token-value payments. Many educated and well-trained officers lost the opportunity to educate younger soldiers, as the necessary equipment and basis lacked adequate funding. Military spending increased gradually, especially in the last 10 years. As of 2005, the budget was no more than $400 mln., while military spending for 2009 amounted to more than $1,3 bln. - almost a triple increase for 4 years. Despite this growth, the military still does not receive sufficient funds for modernization. An example of bad spending plans is the large-scale purchasing of transport aircraft, while the Air Force has a severe need of new fighters (the [[MiG-29]]s, even though modernized, are nearing their operational limits). The planned procurement of 2-4 [[Gowind class corvette]]s has been cancelled. As of 2009, military spending were about 1,98% of GDP. In 2010 the budget is to be only 1,3% due to the international financial crisis.

{{main|Bulgarian Land Forces}}
The Land Forces are functionally divided into '''Deployable''' and '''Reserve Forces'''. Their main functions include deterrence, defence, peace support and [[crisis management]], humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Bulgarian society. Active troops in the land forces number about 18,000 men, and reserve troops number about 300,000. 

The equipment of the land forces is impressive in terms of numbers, but most of it is nonoperational and scheduled to be scrapped or refurbished and exported to other nations. Bulgaria has a military stockpile of about 5,000,000 small arms, models ranging from [[World War II]]-era [[MP 40]] machine pistols to modern [[Steyr AUG]], [[AK-74]], HK [[MP5]], [[HK416]] and AR-M2F assault rifles.

===National guard unit===
{{main|National guard unit}}

The National Guard of [[Bulgaria]], founded in 1879, is the successor to the personal guards of [[Knyaz]] [[Alexander I of Bulgaria|Alexander I]]. On July 12 of that year, the guards escorted the Bulgarian [[knyaz]] for the first time; today, July 12 is the official holiday of the National Guard. Throughout the years the structure of the guards has evolved, going from convoy to squadron, to regiment and, subsequent to 1942, to division. Today it includes military units for army salute and wind orchestra duties.

In 2001, the National Guard unit was designated an official military unit of the Bulgarian army and one of the symbols of state authority, along with the flag, the coat of arms and the national anthem.

==Navy==
{{main|Bulgarian Navy}}

The Navy has traditionally been the smallest component of the Bulgarian military. Established almost simultaneously with the Ground forces in 1879, initially it consisted of a small fleet of boats on the [[Danube]] river. Bulgaria has a coastline of about 354 kilometers - thus, naval warfare is not considered a priority. 

After the downturn in 1990, the Navy was largely overlooked and received almost no funding. No projects for modernization were carried out until 2005, when a [[Wielingen class frigate]] (F912 Wandelaar) was acquired from [[Belgium]]. By 2009, Bulgaria acquired two more frigates of the same class. The first of them was renamed ''41 Drazki'' and took part in several operations and excercises, most notably the [[UNIFIL]] Maritime Patrol along the coast of [[Lebanon]] in 2006, and [[Operation Active Endeavour]]. ''41 Drazki'' is currently (as of April 2011) participating in the enforcement the naval blockade against [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s regime off the coast of [[Libya]]. 

The equipment is typical for a small navy, consisting mostly of light multi-purpose vessels - 4 [[frigate]]s, 3 [[corvette]]s, 5 minesweepers, 2 fast missile craft and 2 landing ships. One submarine - ''84 Slava'' - remains in inventory, although it is not considered in active service as the submarine component was disbanded in 2010. ''84 Slava'' is scheduled to be turned into a museum. Other equipment includes a coastal defence missile battalion armed with locally modified [[P-15 Termit]] missiles, a coastal artillery battery, a naval helicopter airbase and a marine special forces unit. 

The Bulgarian Navy is centered in two main bases - in [[Varna]] and in [[Bourgas]].

==Air Force==

[[File:MiG-29 Graf Ignatievo.jpg|thumb|250px|A pair of BAF MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters at dusk]]
{{main|Bulgarian Air Force}}
In the past decade Bulgaria has been trying actively to restructure its army as a whole and a lot of attention has been placed on keeping the aging Russian aircraft operational. Currently the attack and defence branches of the Bulgarian air force are mainly [[MIG-21]]s, [[MIG-29]]s and [[Su-25]]s. About 16 [[MiG-29]] fighters have been modernized in order to meet [[NATO]] standards. The first aircraft arrived on 11/29/07 and final delivery was due in 03/09. In about 2 years time the government intends to purchase 16 modern jet fighters but due to the lack of funding the procedure of choosing the aircraft has been postponed for years. The main competitors are expected to be [[Eurofighter]], [[Dassault]] [[Rafale]], [[JAS 39 Gripen]], [[F-16]] and [[F-18]]. In 2006 the Bulgarian government signed a contract with [[Alenia Aeronautica]] for the delivery of five [[C-27J Spartan]] transport aircraft in order to replace the old Soviet made [[An-24]] and [[An-26]]- for now only 3 C-27J Spartan will be deliverd as result of the financial crises. The first two Spartan arrived in year 2007 and 2009 the last remaining until 2011.

Modern EU-made transport helicopters were purchased in 2005 and until now 12 [[Eurocopter Cougar]] have arrived (8 transport and 4 CSAR). Recently, the Ministry of Defence terminated the contract with [[Elbit Systems]] for modernizing 12 [[Mi-24]]D and Mi-24V helicopters.

Branches of the airforce include: fighter aviation, assault aviation, intelligence aviation and transportation aviation, aid defence troops, radio-technical troops, communications troops, radio-technical support troops, logistics and medical troops.

===Aircraft Inventory===
{{main|List of active Bulgarian military aircraft}}
With the exception of the Navy's small helicopter fleet, the Air Forces are responsible for all military aircraft in Bulgaria. The Air Forces' inventory numbers 124 aircraft, including 46 combat jets and 42 helicopters. Aircraft of western origin have only begun to enter the fleet, numbering 13 of the total in service.

==Bulgarian-American cooperation==
{{main|Bulgarian-American Joint Military Facilities}}
[[File:Stryker IFV Novo selo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A US [[Stryker]] IFV on a training range near Novo Selo]]
The Bulgarian-American Joint Military Facilities were established by a Defence Cooperation Agreement signed by the [[United States]] and Bulgaria in April 2006. Under the agreement, U.S. forces can conduct training at several bases in the country, which remain under Bulgarian command and under the Bulgarian flag. Under the agreement, no more than 2,500 U.S. military personnel can be located at the joint military facilities. 

''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine lists Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3460 The List: The Six Most Important U.S. Military Bases], FP, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployments==
Both during Communist rule and after, Bulgaria has deployed troops with different tasks in various countries. The table below lists Bulgarian military deployments in foreign countries. Active missions are shown in '''bold'''.

[[Burkina Faso]] (formerly Upper Volta) is a landlocked [[Sahel]] country that shares borders with six nations. It lies between the [[Sahara]] Desert and the [[Gulf of Guinea]], south of the loop of the [[Niger River]]. The land is green in the south, with forests and fruit trees, and desert in the north. Most of central Burkina Faso lies on a [[savanna]] plateau, {{convert|198|-|305|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with fields, brush, and scattered trees. Burkina Faso's game preserves—the most important of which are [[Arly (Burkina Faso)|Arly]], [[Nazinga]], and [[W National Park]]--contain [[Panthera leo|lion]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[hippopotamus]], [[monkey]]s, [[warthog]]s, and [[antelope]]s. Previously the [[endangered]] [[Painted Hunting Dog]], ''[[Lycaon pictus]]'' occurred in Burkina Faso, but, although last sightings were made in [[Arli National Park]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg]&lt;/ref&gt; the species is considered extirpated in Burkina Faso. Tourism is not well developed.

==Climate==

 Geography and climate 
Satellite image of Burkina Faso, generated from raster graphics data supplied by The Map LibraryMain articles: Geography of Burkina Faso and Climate of Burkina Faso
Burkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes 9° and 15°N (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes 6°W and 3°E.

It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a peneplain, which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of 749 meters (2,457 ft). The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to 150 meters (492 ft) high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is 400 meters (1,312 ft) and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than 600 meters (1,969 ft). Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the Black Volta (or Mouhoun), the White Volta (Nakambé) and the Red Volta (Nazinon). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the Komoé, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the Niger River also drains 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's tributaries – the Béli, the Gorouol, the Goudébo and the Dargol – are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large floods. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli and Markoye. Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.

 
Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 millimeters (23.6 and 35.4 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the harmattan – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than 600 millimeters (23.6 in) [13] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, 5–47 degrees Celsius (41–116.6 °F).

A relatively dry tropical savanna, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north latitude, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than 900 millimeters (35.4 in)[13] of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

Burkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt and small deposits of gold.

Burkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see List of national parks in Africa, Nature reserves of Burkina Faso.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Burkina Faso]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:Burkina-Faso-Demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Burkina Faso, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
[[Burkina Faso]]'s 15,3 million people belong to two major [[West Africa]]n cultural groups—the [[Gur]] (Voltaic) and the [[Mandé]]. The Voltaic are far more numerous and include the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], who make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi are still bound by the traditions of the [[Mogho Naba]], who hold court in [[Ouagadougou]].

About 12,000 [[Europe]]ans reside in Burkina Faso, the majority are [[french people|French]].

Most of Burkina's people are concentrated in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer (125/sq. mi.). This population density, high for [[Africa]], causes annual migrations of hundreds of thousands of Burkinabé to [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]] for seasonal agricultural work. About a third of Burkinabé adhere to traditional African religions. The introduction of [[Islam]] to Burkina Faso was initially resisted by the Mossi rulers. [[Christianity|Christian]]s, predominantly [[Roman Catholic]]s, are largely concentrated among the urban elite.

Few Burkinabé have had formal education. Schooling is free but not compulsory, and only about 29% of Burkina's primary school-age children receive a basic education. The [[University of Ouagadougou]], founded in 1974, was the country's first institution of higher education. The [[Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso]] in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] was opened in 1995.

{{Politics of Burkina Faso}}
'''Politics of Burkina Faso''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Burkina Faso]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. The party system is dominated by the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Political history==
In 1990, the [[Popular Front]] held its first National Congress, which formed a committee to draft a national [[constitution]]. The constitution was approved by [[referendum]] in 1991. In 1992, [[Blaise Compaoré]] was elected [[president]], running unopposed after the opposition [[election boycott|boycotted the election]] because of Compaoré's refusal to accede to demands of the opposition such as a sovereign National Conference to set modalities. The opposition did participate in the following year's legislative elections, in which the [[ODP/MT]] won a majority of seats.

The government of the Fourth Republic includes a strong presidency, a [[prime minister]], a Council of Ministers presided over by the president, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legislature and judiciary are independent but remain susceptible to outside influence.

In 1995, Burkina held its first multiparty municipal elections since independence. With minor exceptions, balloting was considered free and fair by the local [[human rights]] organizations which monitored the contest. The president's ODP/MT won over 1,100 of some 1,700 councillor seats being contested.

In February 1996, the ruling ODP/MT merged with several small opposition parties to form the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]] (CDP). This effectively co-opted much of what little viable opposition to Compaoré existed. The remaining opposition parties regrouped in preparation for 1997 legislative elections and the 1998 presidential election. The 1997 legislative elections, which international observers pronounced to be substantially free, fair, and transparent, resulted in a large CDP majority—101 to 111 seats.

The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and may serve up to two terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the consent of the legislature.
The constitution of June 2, 1991, established a semi-presidential government with a [[parliament]] (Assemblée) which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of 5 years. The year 2000 saw a [[constitution]]al amendment reducing the presidential term from 7 to 5 years, which was enforced during the 2005 elections. Another change according to the amendment would have prevented sitting president [[Blaise Compaoré]] from being re-elected. However, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that because Compaoré was already a sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office, thereby clearing the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On November 13 Compaoré was reelected in a landslide due to a divided political opposition.

===Legislative branch===
The '''[[National Assembly of Burkina Faso|National Assembly]]''' (''Assemblée Nationale'') has 111 members, elected for a five year term by [[proportional representation]].

'''[[Burkina Faso]]''' is one of the poorest countries in the world with an average income per capita of €250 (US$300). More than 80 percent of the population relies on [[subsistence agriculture]], with only a small fraction directly involved in [[industry]] and [[tertiary sector of industry|services]]. Highly variable rainfall, poor [[soil]]s, lack of adequate communications and other [[infrastructure]], a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. The [[export]] economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.

The country has a high population density, few [[natural resource]]s, and a fragile [[soil]]. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.

The Burkinabé financial system represents 30 percent of the country’s GDP and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90 percent of total financial system assets. Eleven banks and five non-bank financial institutions operate in the country.

The banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60 percent of total financial sector assets. Banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.

As of 2007, the World Bank estimated that 26 percent of the Burkinabé population has access to financial services. The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) reports that about 41 microfinance institutions (MFIs) operate in the country, serving a total of 800,000 customers. 
Burkina Faso is a member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeurs Mobilières (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. As of 2009, the regional stock exchange’s market capitalization reached nearly 10 percent of Burkina Faso’s GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt;

For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 470.70 CFA Francs only. Mean wages were $0.56 per manhour in 2009.

Current GDP per capita&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html Earthtrends data]&lt;/ref&gt; of Burkina Faso grew 13 percent in the Sixties reaching a peak growth of 237 percent in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 23 percent in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 37 percent in the Nineties. Average wages in 2007 hover around 2 to 3 dollars per day.

[[File:Vendeuse d'arachides edit1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A peanut seller in Ouagadougou.]]Although handicapped by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy, Burkina remains committed to the [[structural adjustment program]] it launched in 1991. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in January 1994, with a 1996 growth rate of 5.9 percent.

Many Burkinabé migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their remittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Burkina is attempting to improve the economy by developing its [[mineral]] resources, improving its infrastructure, making its [[agriculture|agricultural and livestock sectors]] more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and prices of [[cereal]]s.

The agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. The [[Mossi Plateau]] in north central Burkina faces encroachment from the [[Sahara]]. The resultant southward migration means heightened competition for control of very limited [[water resources]] south of the Mossi Plateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as subsistence farmers, living with problems of climate, [[erosion|soil erosion]], and rudimentary technology. The staple crops are [[pearl millet]], [[sorghum]], [[maize]], and [[rice]]. The cash crops are [[cotton]], [[peanut|groundnuts]], [[Shea nut|karite (shea nuts)]], and [[sesame]]. Livestock, once a major export, has declined.

Industry, still in an embryonic stage, is located primarily in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Banfora]], and [[Koudougou]]. Manufacturing is limited to [[food]] processing, [[textile]]s, and other import substitution heavily protected by [[tariffs]]. Some [[factory|factories]] are privately owned, and others are set to be privatized. Burkina's exploitable natural resources are limited, although a [[manganese]] [[ore]] deposit is located in the remote northeast. [[Gold]] mining has increased greatly since the mid-1980s and, along with cotton, is a leading export moneyearner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Communications in [[Burkina Faso]]''' are limited due to the low penetration of [[electricity]], even in major cities. Use of [[telecommunication]]s is extremely low. According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]], in 2004 there were only 479,000 telephone subscribers in the country of nearly 11 million people, with .061 main lines per 1000 inhabitants.  This number climbs to 42.05 main lines/1000 in [[Ouagadougou]], but still a very low penetration rate.

The Burkinabé government, in its telecommunications development strategy, has stated its aims to make telecommunications a universal service accessible to all. A large portion of this strategy is the privatization of the National Telecommunications Office (ONATEL), with additional focus on a rural telephony promotion project.

Internet use is also low in the country, with only 40 users per 10,000 inhabitants in 2004, and just over 53,000 users total, according to the International Telecommunication Union. The sector is beginning to improve following installation of a 22 Mbit/s [[fiber optic]] international link, a vast improvement over the previous 128 kbit/s link. Secondary access nodes are beginning to appear in the major cities, and [[cybercafé]]s are providing Internet access to a broader spectrum of end users.

[[Mobile phone]] technology has skyrocketed in Burkina Faso in the last decade, growing from 2,700 subscribers in 1998 to 398,000 in 2004. Mobile phone subscribers now represent 83% of all telephone users in the country. (International Telecommunication Union, 2006). The mobile telephone segment has benefitted from a competitive environment between operators [[Celtel]], Télécel Faso, and Telmob, which has pushed rates down even as density and coverage area increased.

This article concerns the systems of '''transport in Burkina Faso''', which primarily include road and rail infrastructure.

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Burkina Faso}}
There are 622 kilometres of [[railway]] in [[Burkina Faso]], of which 517&amp;nbsp;km run from Ouagadougou to Abidjan, [[Côte d'Ivoire]]; and 105&amp;nbsp;km from Ouagadougou to Kaya.  All of the railways in the country are of the narrow {{RailGauge|1}} [[metre gauge]].  Only one adjacent country is connected to Burkina Faso via rail, [[Transport in Côte d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]], a country in which the same one-metre gauge is employed.

A rail link connects Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso with the port of Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire: the line from Ouagadougou to the Nigerien capital Niamey stops at Kaya. Google Earth images dated 15/2/07 show construction continuing for approx. 100&amp;nbsp;km northeast towards Dori. Instability in Côte d'Ivoire in 2003 forced a rerouting of rail freight from the Abidjan corridor to ports in Togo, Benin, and Ghana via the road network. A proposed rail link between Ouagadougou and [[Pô]] in Burkina Faso and [[Kumasi]] and [[Boankra]] in Ghana, has been discussed with Ghanaian officials, and feasibility studies are being undertaken to explore this possibility, which would provide rail access to the inland port of Bonakra.

Burkina Faso and Ghana use different rail gauges and this [[break-of-gauge]] can be overcome to a greater or lesser extent with a number of methods.

In 2006, an Indian proposal surfaced to link the railways in Benin and Togo with landlocked Niger and Burkina Faso.  Additionally, a Czech proposal also surfaced to link Ghana railways with Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otal.com/ghana/transportnews.htm OTAL - Ghana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdi.net/documents/WorldBank/databases/ghana/Ghana_burkina_railway_Ghana.pdf World Bank Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  The manganese deposits near [[Dori]] are one source of traffic.  Burkina Faso would also be a participant in the [[AfricaRail]] project.

==== Existing ====

The following towns of Burkina Faso are served by the country's railways:
* [[Banfora]]
* [[Bobo-Dioulasso]]
* [[Koudougou]]
* [[Ouagadougou]] - national capital
* [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]] - terminus

== Highways ==
There is a total of 12,506 kilometres of [[highway]] in Burkina Faso, of which 2,001 kilometres are paved.

In 2000, the Government of Burkina Faso classified 15,000 kilometers of road as part of the national road network managed under the Ministry of Infrastructures Transport and Housing (MITH) through the Directorate of Roads (DGR). This network includes main inter-city roads and access roads for départments' capital cities.  Only ten of the network's main roads are even partially paved, and the paved roads are plagued by dangerous potholes, missing signage, missing barriers and guardrails near roadside hazards, and no pavement markings to separate traffic moving in opposite directions.

==Air==
There are international airports at [[Ouagadougou]] and [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] and numerous smaller airfields. In 2004, the number of airports totaled 33, only 2 of which had paved runways as of 2005.  Burkina Faso owns part of [[Air Afrique]], which provides the country with international service. [[Air Burkina]], which began in 1967, is government-run and has a monopoly on domestic service. It also flies to neighboring countries. In 2003, about 55,000 passengers were transported on domestic and international flights.

The branches of '''[[Burkina Faso]]'s military''' include its Army, Air Force, National Gendarmerie, National Police, and People's Militia. Being a landlocked country, Burkina Faso has no [[navy]].

On April 18, 2011, it was reported that a military mutiny in Burkina Faso had spread to a fourth city, Kaya, after demonstrations in Po and Tenkodogo.&lt;ref&gt;Stratfor.com, 'Burkina Faso: Army Mutiny Spreads,' April 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground Forces==
The Army of Burkina Faso (''L'Armée de Terre'' - Ground Forces or LAT) is a skeletonized force structure of some 5,800-6,000 officers and men, augmented by a conscript force or ''People's Militia'' of some 45,000 men and women. Unlike the police and security forces, the Army and the People's Militia is organized along Soviet/Chinese models and precepts. The Army is equipped with light wheeled armored cars, some mounting cannon.

In recent years, the United States has begun providing military assistance and training to Burkina Faso's ground forces. It has trained three 750-man battalions for peace support operations in Darfur. During a recent UN inspection, the U.S. [[U.S. Department of Defense|DOD]] evaluation team found Burkina's ''Laafi'' battalion fit to deploy to Sudan. Using a small Department of Defense International Military Education and Training (IMET) budget, the Embassy has established English-language courses at an LAT military base, and has brought LAT officers to attended officer basic training courses in the U.S. The government of Burkina Faso has also accepted additional U.S. training assistance in counter-terrorism tactics and humanitarian assistance. Burkina Faso has recently become a member of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative|Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership]] (TSCTP).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of State, ''[http://google.com/search?q=cache:dbTvoNdzEqgJ:www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm+Norbert+Zongo+%22Tertius+Zongo%22&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us Background Note: Burkina Faso - Profile]'' June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air Force==
The Air Force was founded in 1964 as the ''Escadrille de la République de Haute-Volta'' (EHV) or the Republic of Upper Volta Air Squadron, a subordinate unit of the Army. That year, a transient air support base was created with the assistance of the [[French Air Force]]. After acquiring an initial fleet of utility and transport aircraft, the squadron was attached to an interarmy support regiment. In 1970, the ''Escadrille'' was renamed the ''Force Aérienne de Haute-Volta'', or FAHV, and in 1977 became an autonomous force. In October 1985, the ''Force Aérienne de Burkina Faso'', or FABF, was officially inaugurated. 

The EHV was initially formed with two [[Douglas C-47]] Skytrain and three [[Max Holste Broussard|MH.1521M Broussard]] aircraft. These were later followed by two [[Aérospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III SA.316 B]] helicopters, used mostly for liaison purposes, one twin-engined [[Aero Commander 500 family|Aero Commander 500]] light utility aircraft, two [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|Hawker-Siddeley HS.748-2A]] twin turboprop transport aircraft, and two [[Aérospatiale N 262|Nord 262]] twin turboprop transport aircraft. Two ''escadrilles'' (squadrons) or subformations were created: the ''Escadrille de Transport'' (Transport Unit), and the ''Escadrille d'Hélicoptères'' (Helicopter Unit). Later, the ''Escadrille d'Entraînement'' (Training Unit) was added. All squadrons were initially based at Ouagadougou. By 1993, all of the fixed-wing aircraft of the original EHV (with the exception of the two old Nord 262 transports) had been taken out of service, and either scrapped, sold off, or abandoned. 

In mid-1984, Libyan military aid brought eight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] jet fighters, along with two MiG-21U combat trainer versions. These ex-Libyan Air Force MiG-21 'Fishbed' fighters were based in [[Ouagadougou]], although they were actually operated by the Libyan Air Force on loan by Libya, and were removed in 1985 without seeing combat. A single MiG-17F Fresco that was also operated by the FABF did see combat service in the [[Agacher Strip War]] in 1985-86, but proved expensive to operate in terms of fuel, maintenance, and pilot training requirements. It is believed to have been retired from service in 1994, but may still be in storage in an unmaintained condition. 

In 1985, the FABF also acquired two ex-Soviet [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] transport helicopters from an unknown supplier, followed by an additional two Mi-4s. The Mi-4s were operated by the FABF until the late 1980s, when they were taken out of service. Five [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]]/17 transport helicopters were later added to the ''Escadrille d'Hélicoptères''. While supervising the ceasefire after the [[Agacher Strip War]], an FABF SA.316B Alouette III crashed at Kouni on 14 January 1986, leaving only one SA.316B still in service with the ''Escadrille d'Hélicoptères''. 

In 1986, the FABF formed a new unit, the ''Escadrille de Chasse'' (EdC) (Attack Unit). In mid-1986 six ex-Philippine Air Force [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF.260WP Warrior]] armed trainers/light strike aircraft were acquired from a dealer in Belgium, which offered the FABF a much simpler and less expensive alternative in tactical air support to the expensive MiGs. The Warriors were not only used for pilot training, but also as light strike aircraft, and a number of them were employed by the FABF's ''Escadrille de Chasse'' (EdC). Four additional SF.260WPs were subsequently bought directly from Italy. The six ex-Philippine SF.260WP aircraft were taken out of service in 1993 and returned to their previous owner, although the four newly-built SF.260WP aircraft were retained in service, and stationed at Bobo Dioulasso air base.

Most of the other light aircraft acquired by the FABF in the 1970s and 1980s have also now been retired along with the Mi-4 helicopters, but some recent acquisitions have been made, including a [[Beech Aircraft|Beechcraft]] ''[[Beechcraft King Air|King Air]]'', a Piper [[Piper PA-34 Seneca|PA-34 ''Seneca'']], a [[Apex Aircraft|CEAPR]] ''Robin'' light training aircraft, and a single [[Air Tractor]] ''[[Air Tractor AT-802|AT-802]]'' aerial sprayer aircraft for spraying insecticides, purchased after the northern part of the country suffered heavy crop damage from a 2004 invasion of swarming [[Migratory locust|locusts]]. In 2009, two Xenon Gyroplane autogyros were purchased for use by police and security forces.

In late 2005, the FABF acquired two [[Mil Mi-35]] 'Hind' attack helicopters from Russia in apparent response by moves by neighbouring [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to bolster its own air attack capabilities during the [[Ivorian Civil War]].

==Aircraft Inventory==
Burkina Faso's military aircraft operated by the FABF totals 19 aircraft of 15 different models, including 11 helicopters. Currently, the FABF does not appear to have any fixed-wing combat aircraft in operational condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Burkina Faso}}
[[Burkina Faso]] has good relations with the [[European Union]], African, and Asian countries. France, the former colonial power, in particular, continues to provide significant aid and supports [[Blaise Compaoré|Compaoré's]] developing role as a regional powerbroker. Burkina maintains diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China]] (usually referred to as &quot;[[Taiwan]]&quot;) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. State Department, &quot;[[Burkina Faso-United States relations|U.S. relations with Burkina Faso]] are good but subject to strains in the past because of the Compaoré government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{StateDept}} [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burkina Faso's relations with its West African neighbors have improved in recent years. Relations with [[Ghana]], in particular, have warmed with a change in government in that country. President Compaoré has mediated a political crisis in [[Togo]] and helped to resolve the [[Taureg people|Tuareg]] conflict in [[Niger]]. Burkina maintains cordial relations with [[Libya]]. A territorial dispute with [[Mali]] was mediated by Ghana and [[Nigeria]] and has led to lessening of tensions between the two nations.

Since the 2002 Civil War in the [[Ivory Coast]], relations between it and Burkina Faso have been filled with accusations of Burkinabé support for rebels on one side and claims of mistreatment of Burkinabé workers on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Ivorian raiders &quot;are foreigners&quot;'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4720883.stm BBC], July 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blaise Campaoré:&lt;&lt;La crise ivoirienne inquiète le Burkina&gt;&gt;'', [http://www.lefigaro.fr/index.html Le Figaro], December 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ivory Coast remains Burkina Faso's largest regional trading partner in spite of their disputes and tens of thousands of Burkinabés continue to work in the Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;''Unending Crises'', [http://africatoday.eh7.co.uk/cgi-bin/public.cgi?sub=news&amp;action=one&amp;cat=23&amp;id=532 Africa Today], February 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen provinces of Burkina Faso are joined with contiguous areas of Mali and [[Niger]] under the [[Liptako-Gourma Authority]], a regional economic organization.

Burkina Faso is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]])

==Bilateral relations==
===Benin===
In September 2007, [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) intervened to attempt to resolve the dispute over two villages along the [[Benin]]-Burkina Faso border that remain from a 2005 ICJ decision.

===Côte d'Ivoire===
Despite the presence of more than 9,000 UN forces (UNOCI) in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] since 2004, ethnic conflict continues to spread into neighboring states who can no longer send their migrant workers to work in Ivorian cocoa plantations.

{{main|Burkina Faso – Ghana relations}}

With the coming to power of [[Thomas Sankara]] in [[Burkina Faso]] in 1983, relations between [[Ghana]] and Burkina became both warm and close. Indeed, [[Rawlings]] and Sankara began discussions about uniting Ghana and Burkina in the manner of the defunct [[Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union]], which Nkrumah had sought unsuccessfully to promote as a foundation for his dream of unified continental government. Political and economic ties between Ghana and Burkina, a poorer country, were strengthened through joint commissions of cooperation and through border demarcation committee meetings. Frequent high-level consultations and joint military exercises, meant to discourage potential dissidents and to protect young &quot;revolutions&quot; in each country, were fairly regular features of Ghana-Burkina relations.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Owusu, Maxwell. &quot;Burkina&quot;.

===United States===
{{main|Burkina Faso – United States relations}}

Relations are good but subject to strains in the past because of the [[Blaise Compaoré|Compaoré]] government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity. In addition to regional peace and stability, U.S. interests in Burkina are to promote continued [[democratization]] and greater respect for [[human rights]] and to encourage sustainable economic development. Although the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) closed its office in [[Ouagadougou]] in 1995, about $18 million annually of USAID funding goes to Burkina's development through non-governmental and regional organizations. The largest is a [[Food for Peace]] school lunch program administered by [[Catholic Relief Services]]. Burkina has been the site of several development success stories. U.S. leadership in building food security in the [[Sahel]] after the 1968-74 [[drought]] has been successful in virtually eliminating [[famine]], despite recurrent drought years. [[River blindness]] has been eliminated from the region. In both cases, the U.S. was the main donor to inter-African organizations headquartered in Ouagadougou which through sustained efforts have achieved and consolidated these gains. In 2005, Burkina Faso and the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC) signed a $12 million Threshold Country Program to build schools and increase girls' enrollment rates. In November 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Burkina Faso as eligible to submit a proposal for Millennium Challenge Account assistance for fiscal year 2006, making it one of only two countries eligible for threshold as well as compact funding. The [[Government of Burkina Faso]] is working closely with MCC staff to finalize its compact submission.

===Russia===
{{main|Burkina Faso – Russia relations}}

Diplomatic relations between Burkina Faso and the Soviet Union were established for the first time on February 18, 1967. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Burkina Faso recognized Russia as the USSR's successor. However financial reasons has shut the embassies between the two nations. In 1992, the embassy of the Russian Federation in [[Ouagadougou]] was closed, and in 1996, the embassy of Burkina Faso in Moscow was closed.

===Kosovo===
Burkina Faso recognized [[Kosovo]] on 24 April 2008. In addition, Burkina Faso emphasized its interest to establish strong ties with the new sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newkosovareport.com/20080424902/Politics/Burkina-Faso-recognizes-Kosovo.html|title=Burkina Faso recognizes Kosovo|work=New Kosova Report|date=2008-04-24|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burundi''' is located in central [[Africa]], to the east of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], at the co-ordinates {{coord|3|30|S|30|0|E|}}.

==Physical geography==
[[Burundi]] occupies an area equal to 27,830 square kilometres in size, of which 25,650&amp;nbsp;km² is land.  The country has 974 kilometres of land border: 233&amp;nbsp;km of which is shared with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 290&amp;nbsp;km with [[Rwanda]] and 451&amp;nbsp;km with [[Tanzania]].  As a landlocked country, Burundi possesses no coastline, although it straddles the crest of the [[Nile]]-[[Congo River]] watershed. The farthest headwaters of the Nile, the [[Ruvyironza River]], has its source in Burundi.

===Climate===
Burundi in general has a tropical highland climate, with a considerable daily temperature range in many areas. Temperature also varies considerably from one region to another, chiefly as a result of differences in altitude. The central plateau enjoys pleasantly cool weather, with an average temperature of {{convert|20|°C}}. The area around [[Lake Tanganyika]] is warmer, averaging {{convert|23|°C|1}}; the highest mountain areas are cooler, averaging {{convert|16|°C|1}}. [[Bujumbura]]’s average annual temperature is &lt;br&gt;{{convert|23|°C|1}}. Rain is irregular, falling most heavily in the northwest. Dry seasons vary in length, and there are sometimes long periods of drought. However, four seasons can be distinguished: the long dry season (June–August), the short wet season (September–November), the short dry season (December–January), and the long wet season (February–May). Most of Burundi receives between {{convert|1300|and|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall a year. The [[Ruzizi Plain]] and the northeast receive between {{convert|750|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

===Terrain===
The terrain of Burundi is hilly and [[mountain]]ous, dropping to a plateau in the east.  The southern and eastern [[plain]]s have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as part of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion.

The lowest point in the country is at [[Lake Tanganyika]], at 772 m, with the highest point being on [[Mount Heha]], at 2,684 m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/africa/burundi/land_and_resources.htm Burundi, land and resources]&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural hazards are posed in Burundi by flooding and landslides.

===Natural resources===
Burundi possesses reserves of: [[nickel]], [[uranium]], rare earth oxides, [[peat]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[platinum]] (not yet exploited) and [[vanadium]].  There is also arable land and the potential for hydropower.  140&amp;nbsp;km² of land in Burundi is irrigated.  The table below describes land use in Burundi.

! Use !! Percentage of Area
|-
! arable land
| 35.57
|-
! permanent crops
| 13.12
|-
!other
| 51.31
|-
|}

==Environment==
===Current issues===
Soil erosion is an issue for Burundi, and is as a result of overgrazing and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands.  Other issues include: deforestation, due to the uncontrolled cutting-down of trees for fuel; and habitat loss threatens wildlife populations.

===International agreements===
Burundi is a party to the following international agreements that relate to the environment: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes and Ozone Layer Protection.  The following have been signed but not yet ratified by Burundi: Law of the Sea and Nuclear Test Ban.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Burundi]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northern-most point - unnamed location on the border with [[Rwanda]] immediately south of the Rwandna town of [[Mbuye]], [[Muyinga Province]]
* Eastern-most point - unnamed location on the border with [[Tanzania]] immediately north-west of [[Mburi hill]], [[Cankuzo Province]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Burundi]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:Burundi-Demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Burundi, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
At 206.1 persons per km²., [[Burundi]] has the second-largest [[population density]] in Sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]]. Most people live on [[farm]]s near areas of fertile volcanic soil. The population is made up of three major [[ethnic group]]s &amp;ndash; [[Hutu]] (''Bahutu''), [[Tutsi]] (''Batutsi'' or ''Watusi''), and [[Twa]] (''Batwa''). [[Kirundi]] is the common language. Intermarriage takes place frequently between the Hutus and Tutsis. The terms &quot;[[pasture|pastoralist]]&quot; and &quot;[[agriculture|agriculturist]]&quot;, often used as ethnic designations for Watusi and Bahutu, respectively, are only occupational titles which vary among individuals and groups. Although Hutus encompass the majority of the population, historically Tutsis have been politically and economically dominant.

{{Politics of Burundi}}
'''Politics of Burundi''' takes place in a framework of a transitional [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Burundi]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of parliament, the [[Senate of Burundi|Senate]] and the [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]].

==Political landscape after the civil war==
The political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the [[civil war]] and a long [[Peacebuilding|peace process]] and move to [[democracy]].  The current [[President of Burundi]] is [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], a former rebel leader of the [[Hutu]] [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] who was [[Burundi elections, 2005|elected unopposed]] as the new [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President of Burundi]] by the [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] on 19 August 2005.  Nkurunziza was the first president chosen through democratic means since the start of the [[Burundi Civil War|civil war]] in 1993 and was sworn in on 26 August, replacing transitional president [[Domitien Ndayizeye]].

In November 1995, the presidents of [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zaire]] (currently [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. In July 1996, former Burundian President [[Pierre Buyoya|Buyoya]] returned to power in a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. He declared himself president of a transitional republic, even as he suspended the National Assembly, banned opposition groups, and imposed a nationwide curfew. Widespread condemnation of the coup ensued, and regional countries imposed economic sanctions pending a return to a constitutional government. Buyoya agreed in 1996 to liberalize political parties. Nonetheless, fighting between the army and [[Hutu]] militias continued. In June 1998, Buyoya promulgated a transitional constitution and announced a partnership between the government and the opposition-led National Assembly. After facilitator Julius Nyerere's death in October 1999, the regional leaders appointed [[Nelson Mandela]] as [[Facilitator]] of the [[Arusha]] peace process. Under Mandela the peace process has revived and important progress has taken place.

Extra seats in both chambers can be added to ensure that ethnic and gender quotas are met. Burundi has a [[multi-party]] system, with two or three strong parties and a third party that is electorally successful. Parties are usually based on ethnic background.

'''[[Burundi]]''' is a [[landlocked]], resource-poor country with an underdeveloped [[manufacturing]] sector. The mainstay of the Burundian economy is [[agriculture]], accounting for 58% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 1997. Agriculture supports more than 90% of the labour force, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers. Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, the ongoing civil war, [[overpopulation]], and [[soil erosion]] have contributed to the contraction of the subsistence economy by 25% in recent years. Large numbers of [[internally displaced person]]s have been unable to produce their own food and are largely dependent on international humanitarian assistance. Burundi is a net food importer, with food accounting for 17% of imports in 1997.

==Agriculture==
{{see|Agriculture in Burundi}}
The main [[cash crop]] of Burundi is [[coffee]], which accounted for 78.5% of exports in 1997. This dependence on coffee has increased Burundi's vulnerability to seasonal yields and international coffee prices.It generates about 90 percent of export revenues, making the country particularly vulnerable to terms of trade shocks: the current account deficit in 2007 ran at 15 percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/burundi/burundi-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee is the largest state-owned enterprise. In recent years, the government has tried to attract private investment to this sector, with some success. Efforts to privatize other publicly held enterprises have stalled. Other principal exports include tea and raw cotton. 

Burundi is the largest banana market in Africa.

==Industry==
Little industry exists except the processing of agricultural exports. Although potential wealth in [[petroleum]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], and other natural resources is being explored, the uncertain security situation has prevented meaningful investor interest. Industrial development also is hampered by Burundi's distance from the sea and high transport costs. [[Lake Tanganyika]] remains an important trading point. The trade [[embargo]], lifted in 1999, negatively impacted trade and industry. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 people and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short supply.

Burundi is heavily dependent on bilateral and multilateral aid, with external debt totalling $1.247 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (1.247 G$) in 1997. A series of largely unsuccessful 5-year plans initiated in July 1986 in partnership with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund attempted to reform the foreign exchange system, liberalize imports, reduce restrictions on international transactions, diversify exports, and reform the coffee industry.

[[Image:Karuzi Burundi goats.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Goat rearing has been promoted as a source of income for rural-dwelling Burundians.]]IMF structural adjustment programs in Burundi were suspended following the outbreak of the crisis in 1993. The World Bank has identified key areas for potential growth, including the productivity of traditional crops and the introduction of new exports, light manufactures, industrial mining, and services. Other serious problems include the state's role in the economy, the question of governmental transparency, and debt reduction.

To protest the [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|1996 coup]] by President [[Pierre Buyoya]], neighbouring countries imposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never officially ratified by the [[United Nations Security Council]], most countries refrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the [[United States]] also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi. The regional embargo was lifted on January 23, 1999, based on progress by the government in advancing national reconciliation through the Burundi peace process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Communications in Burundi''' refers to the telephony, internet, postal, radio, and television systems of [[Burundi]].

==Telephony==
As of April 2010, the CIA factbook described the telephone system as “primitive” with “one of the lowest” telephone densities in the world and “increasing. . . .but meager” use of cell phones.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;&gt;CIA. (2010, April 1) ''Burundi''. Retrieved April 9, 2010, from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the number of fixed-line telephone connections is far fewer than one per every 100 persons, with about five in use cell phones per 100 persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt; The international country code is 257.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, there were 30,400 main telephone lines in use, making Burundi 178th in the world in terms of countries with the most main telephone lines in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt; This was a decrease from 2006 in which 35,000 main telephone lines were in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia9&quot;&gt;CIA.''Burundi''. Retrieved August 19, 2009, from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, there had been only 27,000 main telephone lines in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia5&quot;&gt;CIA.''Burundi''. Retrieved September 8, 2006, from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html&lt;/ref&gt; In  1995, there were 17,000 main telephone lines in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia1&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, there were 480,600 cellular phones in use, making Burundi 156th in the world in terms of countries with the most cell phones in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt; This was a large increase with the number of cell phones almost doubling from the 250,000 in use in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia9&quot;/&gt; In 2005, there had been 153,000 cell phones in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia5&quot;/&gt; In 1995 there had been 343 cell phones in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia1&quot;/&gt;

As of 2010, the domestic telephone system consists of open-wire, raditelephone communications, along with low capacity microwave radio relay.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt;

As of 2008, there was one satellite earth station, operated by Intelsat in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt;

==Internet==
[[File:Allocation of IPv4 Address Space BI.svg|right|thumb|The increase in [[IPv4]] address space allocated to Burundi is sign of greater internet use]]
The internet country code is .bi.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt; As of 2009, there were 191 internet hosts, making Burundi 189th in the world in terms of number of internet hosts. This is a slight increase from 162 internet hosts in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia9&quot;/&gt;
As of 2008, there were 65,000 internet users, making Burund 167th in the world in terms of countries with the most internet users.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt; This was a small increase from 60,000 internet users in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia9&quot;/&gt;

==Postal Service==
[[Régie Nationale des Postes]] is the company responsible for postal service in Burundi.

==Radio and television==
As of 2001, there were zero AM radio broadcast stations, four FM stations, and one shortwave one.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia10&quot;/&gt; In 1998, there had been two AM stations, two FM stations, and no shortwave stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia1&quot;&gt;CIA.''Burundi''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of systems of '''transport in Burundi''', including road and water-based infrastructure, the latter of which makes use of [[Lake Tanganyika]].  Furthermore, there are also some airports in [[Burundi]].

A great hindrance to Burundi’s economic development is lack of adequate transportation. The country is [[landlock]]ed, and there are currently no railways in Burundi.

== Roads ==
Roads total {{convert|12322|km}} as of 2004, and only about 7 percent of them remain open in all weather; the rest are classed as local roads or tracks. In 2003, there were 24,000 passenger cars and 23,500 commercial vehicles.

===Roadways===
*total: 12,322&amp;nbsp;km
*paved: 1,286&amp;nbsp;km
*unpaved: 11,036 (2004)

== Waterways ==
[[Lake Tanganyika]] is used for transport, with the major [[port]] on the lake being [[Bujumbura]]. Most &lt;!-- money --&gt; freight is transported down waterways.

== Airports ==
Burundi possesses eight [[airport]]s, of which one has paved [[runway]]s, whose length exceeds 3,047m. The main airport in the country is [[Bujumbura International Airport]].

===Airports - with paved runways===
*total: 1
*over 3,047 m: 1 (2008)

===Airports - with unpaved runways===
*total: 7
**914 to 1,523 m: 4
**under 914 m: 3 (2008)

===Air Service===
Air service is maintained by [[Air Burundi]], which operates domestic service and flies to [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. International service is also provided by [[Air Zaïre]], Sabena, and other airlines. As of 2004, there were an estimated eight airports in
Burundi, of which the international airport in Bujumbura (as of 2005) was the country’s primary and only paved airport. There are also a number of helicopter landing strips. In 1997, 11,000 passengers travelled on international and domestic flights.

===Heliports===
1 (2007)

== Railways ==
Burundi does not possess any [[railway]] infrastructure, although there are proposals to connect Burundi to its neighbours via railway.

A [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] study in August 2006 resulted in a promise to construct a railway starting at the existing [[Tanzania]]n railway network, connecting at [[Isaka]], running via [[Kigali]] in [[Rwanda]], through to Burundi. Tanzanian railways use {{RailGauge|m}} [[metre gauge]], although [[TAZARA]] and other neighbouring countries, including the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) use the {{RailGauge|1067}} [[Cape gauge]], leading to some potential difficulties.

Another project was launched in the same year, which aims to link Burundi and Rwanda (which also has no railways) to the DRC and [[Zambia]], and therefore to the rest of Southern Africa. At a meeting to inaugurate the [[Northern Corridor Transit Coordination Authority]] (NCTCA), the governments of Uganda and Burundi backed the proposed new railway from the Ugandan western [[railhead]] at [[Kasese]] into the DRC.

Additionally, Burundi has been added to a planned railway project to connect Tanzania and Rwanda.

{{Politics of Burundi}}
[[Burundi]]'s relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Burundian [[refugee]]s have at various times crossed to neighboring [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania. Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions.

Burundi is a member of various international and regional organizations, including the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[African Development Bank]] and the [[Francophonie]]. Burundi is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]). The Swedish [[Minister for Integration and Gender Equality]], [[Nyamko Sabuni]], was born in Burundi.

Burundi and [[Rwanda]] dispute sections of border on the [[Akanyaru]]/[[Kanyaru]] and the [[Kagera River|Kagera]]/[[Nyabarongo]] rivers, which have changed course since the 1960s, when the boundary was delimited; cross-border conflicts among [[Tutsi]], [[Hutu]], other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces persist in the Great Lakes region.

The '''Bosphorus''' or '''Bosporus''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbɒsp.ər‿əs}}, {{lang-tr|[[wikt:Boğaziçi|Boğaziçi]]}}, {{lang-el|[[wikt:Βόσπορος|Βόσπορος]]}}, ''Vosporos'', {{lang-bg|[[wikt:Босфора|Босфора]]}}, ''Босфора''), also known as the ''Istanbul Strait'' ({{lang-tr|İstanbul Boğazı}}), is a [[strait]] that forms part of the boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. It is one of the [[Turkish Straits]], along with the [[Dardanelles]]. The world's narrowest strait used for [[International waterway|international navigation]], it connects the [[Black Sea]] with the [[Sea of Marmara]] (which is connected by the Dardanelles to the [[Aegean Sea]], and thereby to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]).

Bosphorus' limits are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north and between the [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and the [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]] in the south. The strait is between the limits {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width {{convert|704|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Kandilli Point and Aşiyan.&lt;ref name=&quot;d&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc  |publisher=Denizcilik |title=Türk Boğazları ve Marmara Denizi'nin Coğrafi Konumu-İstanbul Boğazı  |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth of Bosphorus varies from {{convert|36|to|124|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The most shallow locations are off Kadıköy İnciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off Aşiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;d&quot;/&gt;

The shores of the strait are heavily populated as the city of [[Istanbul]] (with a metropolitan area in excess of 11 million inhabitants) straddles it.

The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Bosporos'' (Βόσπορος),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosporos&quot;&gt;Entry: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2320416 '''{{polytonic|Βόσπορος}}'''] at Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, 1940, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt; which the ancient Greeks analysed as ''bous'' {{polytonic|[[wikt:βοῦς|βοῦς]]}} 'ox' + ''poros'' {{polytonic|[[wikt:πόρος|πόρος]]}} 'means of passing a river, ford, ferry', thus meaning '[[ox]]-[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]'. Although it has been known for a while that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in an example of a density flow, findings of a study by the University of Leeds in August 2010 reveal that there is in fact an underwater river flowing through the Mediterranean and under the Bosphorus (caused by the difference in density of the two seas), which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were to be on land.&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds.ac.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
{{Main|Black Sea deluge theory}}
[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|A map depicting the location of the Bosporus (red) relative to the [[Dardanelles]] (yellow) and the [[Sea of Marmara]].]]

The exact cause for the formation of the Bosphorus remains the subject of vigorous debate among geologists. Thousands of years ago, the [[Black Sea]] became disconnected from the [[Aegean Sea]].  The [[Black Sea deluge theory]] (published in 1997 by [[William Ryan (geologist)|William Ryan]] and [[Walter C. Pitman, III|Walter Pitman]] from [[Columbia University]]) contends that the Bosphorus was formed about 5600 BC when the rising waters of the Mediterranean/[[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the Black Sea, which at the time (according to the theory) was a low-lying body of fresh water.

It is also said in myth that floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]] or Clashing Rocks once crushed any ship that attempted passage of the Bosporus until the hero [[Jason]] obtained passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.

== Biblical reference ==

St. [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]] translates the Hebrew ''besepharad'' in Obadiah, 1-20 as &quot;Bosforus&quot;, but other translations give it as &quot;[[Sepharad]]&quot; (probably [[Sardis]], but later identified with Spain).&lt;ref&gt;[[Obadiah]], [http://bible.cc/obadiah/1-20.htm 1-20].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greece, Persia, Rome, the Byzantines and the Ottoman Empire ==
[[File:Allum Bosphorus.jpg|thumb|''The Bosphorus with the Castles of Europe and Asia''. 19th century engraving by [[Thomas Allom]]. The castles are [[Rumelihisarı]] and [[Anadoluhisarı]], respectively.]]

As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosporus has always been of great commercial and strategic importance. The Greek city-state of [[Athens]] in the 5th century BC, which was dependent on grain imports from [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].

Persian King [[Darius I]] the Great, in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horseman north of Black sea, crossed over at the Bosphorus, then marching up to the [[Danube]]. His army crossed the Bosphorus over an enormous bridge made by connecting [[Achaemenid]] boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindus of India|author=Jagdev Singh|publisher=Gyan Books|year=1998|pages=79|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O_rtrdlOJXwC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Achaemenid+boat+bridge&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1s04TYvGNoa8lQfnvfHtBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Achaemenid%20boat%20bridge&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge essentially, connected the farthest most geographic tip of Asia, to Europe, encompasing at least some 1000 meters of open water if not more. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Herodotus: a new English version, Volume 3|author=Herodotus(Translation by George Rawlinson, Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson)|publisher=John Murray|year=1859|pages=77 (Chp. 86)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UYkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=bosphorus+width&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tdM4Tfq-JcSAlAfknLRy&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bosphorus%20width&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, a similar boat bridge would be constructed by [[Xerxes I]], in his invasion of Greece. 

The strategic significance of the strait was one of the factors in the decision of the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great to found there in AD 330 his new capital, [[Constantinople]], which came to be known as the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. On 29 May 1453 it was [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] by the emerging [[Ottoman Empire]]. In fact, as the Ottoman Turks closed in on Istanbul, they constructed a fortification on each side of the strait, [[Anadoluhisarı]] (1393) and [[Rumelihisarı]] (1451).

== Strategic importance ==

The strategic importance of the Bosporus remains high, and control over it has been an objective of a number of hostilities in modern history, notably the [[Russo–Turkish War, 1877–1878]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].

At its peak in the 16th through the 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire had wrested control of the entire [[Black Sea]] area, which was for the time an &quot;Ottoman lake&quot;, on which Russian warships were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_koprulu_era.html |title=Turkey - Köprülü Era |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, several international treaties have governed vessels using the waters. Under the Treaty of Hünkar Iskelesi of 1833, the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits were to be closed on Russian demand to naval vessels of other powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_external_threats_and_internal_transformations.html |title=Turkey - External Threats and Internal Transformations |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War I, the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. This was amended under the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which restored the straits to Turkish territory{{ndash}}but allowed all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely. Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarized the straits area. The reversion to this old regime was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of July 1936. That convention, which is still in practical force {{as of|2011|lc=on}}, treats the straits as an international shipping lane, but Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea nations (such as [[Greece]], a traditional enemy, or [[Algeria]]).

During [[World War II]], through February 1945, when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations. In the conferences during World War II, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] openly requested the concession of Soviet military bases on the [[Straits]], even though Turkey was not involved in the war. This incident, coupled with Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Artvin]] and [[Ardahan]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (which were lost by Turkey with the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878, but were regained with the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921) was one of the main reasons why Turkey decided to give up its general principle of neutrality in foreign affairs. Turkey did declare war against Germany in February 1945, but did not engage in offensive actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |title=Foreign Policy Research Institute: The Turkish Factor in the Geopolitics of the Post-Soviet Space (Igor Torbakov) |publisher=Fpri.org |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertcutler.org/ch91dc.htm |title=Turkish-Soviet Relations |publisher=Robert Cutler |date=1999-03-28 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/relations-with-turkey |title=Russia's relations with Turkey |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/yazarDetay.do;jsessionid=DC0C8B5C41104733FE75243EF5E99B20.node1?haberno=36433 |title=Today's Zaman: Against who and where are we going to stand?

In more recent years, the Turkish Straits have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits.

== Crossings ==

[[File:Rumeli hisari.jpg|thumb|View of the Bosphorus and [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] as seen from [[Rumelihisarı]].]]

The waters of the strait are traversed by numerous ferries. Two [[bridge]]s cross the Bosphorus. The first, the [[Bosphorus Bridge]], is {{convert|1074|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and was completed in 1973. The second, [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge|Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Bosphorus II) Bridge]], is {{convert|1090|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and was completed in 1988 about {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the first bridge. It forms part of the [[Trans-European Motorway]]. Plans for a [[Third Bosphorus Bridge|third bridge]], which will allow transit traffic to by-pass the city traffic, have been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. The bridge will be built near the northern end of the Bosphorus, between the villages of Garipçe on the European side and Poyrazköy on the Asian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey-unveils-route-for-istanbuls-third-bridge.html|title=Turkey Unveils Route for Istanbul's Third Bridge|publisher=[[Anatolian Agency]]|date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be part of the &quot;Northern Marmara Motorway&quot;, which will be further integrated with the existing Black Sea Coastal Highway.

Another crossing, [[Marmaray]], is a {{convert|13.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} long undersea [[Rail transport|railway]] [[tunnel]] currently under construction and is expected to be completed in 2012. Approximately {{convert|1400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of the tunnel will run under the strait, at a depth of about {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.
== Submarine Channel ==
{{One source|section|date=February 2011}}
In 2010, a team of scientists led by the University of Leeds used a robotic 'yellow submarine' to observe detailed flows within an 'undersea river' for the very first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents - underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets - from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed. 

The team, led by Dr Dan Parsons and Dr Jeff Peakall from the University of Leeds, has been able to study the detailed flow within these channels. Dr Parsons quoted as: &quot;The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral to that found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.&quot; 

It is thought by some that the channels in the Black Sea were formed around 6,000 years ago when sea levels were approaching their current point. The Mediterranean swelled and breached through into the Black Sea - once an isolated freshwater lake - via the Bosphorus Strait. As the waters surged, they carried a dense, salty fluid which formed a network of sea-floor channels that are almost constantly active, even today.  

Some people even believe that this was the biblical event Noah's flood, but despite their historical significance, the first spectacular images of these submarine channels were obtained  in 1999 by Di Iorio et al. &lt;ref&gt;Di Iorio, D., and Yüce, H. (1999). Observations of Mediterranean flow into the Black Sea. Journal of Geophysical Research 104(C2), 3091-3108.&lt;/ref&gt; in the frame of a NATO SACLANT Undersea Research project using jointly the NATO RV Alliance, and the Turkish Navy Survey ship &quot;Cubuklu&quot;. In 2002, a new survey was carried out on board the Ifremer RV &quot;Le Suroit&quot; for BlaSON project (Lericolais, et al., 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Lericolais, G., Le Drezen, E., Nouzé, H., Gillet, H., Ergun, M., Cifci, G., Avci, M., Dondurur, D., and Okay, S. (2002). Recent canyon heads evidenced at the Bosphorus outlet. EOS transactions, AGU Fall Meet. Suppl. 83(47), Abstract PP71B-0409.&lt;/ref&gt;) completed the multibeam mapping of this underwater channel fan-delta. A complete map was published in 2009 by Flood et al.(&lt;ref&gt;Flood, R. D., Hiscott, R. N., and Aksu, A. E. (2009). Morphology and evolution of an anastomosed channel network where saline underflow enters the Black Sea. Sedimentology 56(3), 807-839.&lt;/ref&gt;) using these previous results with high quality mapping obtained in 2006 (by researchers at Memorial University, Newfoundland, Canada who are project partners in this study).   

The team will use the data obtained to create innovative computer simulations that can be used to model how sediment flows through these channels. The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.

The project was led by Dr Jeff Peakall and Dr Daniel Parsons at the University of Leeds in collaboration with the University of Southampton, Memorial University (Newfoundland, Canada), and the Institute of Marine Sciences (Izmir, Turkey). The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences Research Ship, the R/V Koca Piri Reis. 

The researchers estimate that the river - known as a submarine channel - would be the sixth largest river in the world if it were on land based on the amount of water flowing through it.&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds.ac.uk&quot;/&gt;

== Sightseeing ==

A cheap way to explore the Bosporus is offered by the public ferries that traverse the Bosporus from [[Eminönü]] (ferries dock at the ''Boğaz Iskelesi'') on the historic peninsula of Istanbul to Anadolu Kavağı near the Black Sea, zigzagging between the Rumelian and Anatolian sides of the city.

It is also possible to experience the Bosphorus by taking a regular ride in one of the public ferries that travel between the European and the Asian sides. It is also possible to travel by the privately owned ferries available between [[Üsküdar]] and [[Beşiktaş]] or [[Kabataş]].

There are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.

[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels c. 979]]
The most common theory for the [[toponymy]] of Brussels is that it derives from the [[Old Dutch]] ''Broeksel'' or other spelling variants, which means marsh (''broek'') and home (''sel'') or &quot;home in the marsh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert van Istendael]] ''Arm Brussel'', uitgeverij Atlas, ISBN 90-450-0853-X&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the settlement that was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |title=Brussels History |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Vindicianus]], the bishop of Cambrai made the first recorded reference to the place &quot;Brosella&quot; in 695&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} {{cite book |title=Nouvelles archives historiques, philosophiques, et littéraires|volume=1 |last=Jean Baptiste D'Hane, François Huet, P.A.

The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint Gudula from [[Moorsel]] to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

[[Lambert I of Leuven]], [[Counts of Leuven|Count of Leuven]] gained the County of Brussels around 1000 by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the [[Zenne|Senne]] on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels grew quite quickly; it became a commercial centre that rapidly extended towards the upper town ([[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral]], [[Coudenberg]], Sablon/Zavel area...), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. The Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]] at about this time (1183/1184). In the 13th century, the city got [[Fortifications of Brussels|its first walls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html Zo ontstond Brussel] Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie – Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|Grand Place after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]

After the construction of the first walls of Brussels, in the early 13th century, Brussels grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected between 1356 and 1383. Today, traces of it can still be seen, mostly because the &quot;[[small ring]]&quot;, a series of roadways in downtown Brussels bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.

In the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] with [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son), with another line of descent from the Habsburgs (Maximilian of Austria, later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], married [[Mary of Burgundy]], who was born in Brussels). Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Low Countries]], and flourished.

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], heir of the Low Countries since 1506, though (as he was only 6 years old) governed by his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] until 1515, was declared King of Spain, in 1516, in the Cathedral of Saint Gudule in Brussels. Upon the death of his grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519, Charles became the new archduke of the [[Habsburg Empire]] and thus the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of the Empire &quot;[[the empire on which the sun never sets|on which the sun does not set]]&quot;. It was in [[Coudenberg|the Palace complex at Coudenberg]] that Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.

In 1695, King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4000 buildings, a third of those in the city. The reconstruction of [[pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed the appearance of the city and left numerous traces still visible today. The city [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] but was handed back to Austria three years later.

[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Wappers]] (1834)]]

In 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] took place in Brussels after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the [[La Monnaie]] theatre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first King of the Belgians, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings. Following independence, the city underwent many more changes. The [[Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871 its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings and boulevards characteristic of downtown Brussels today.

[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the first world physics conference.]]

During the 20th century the city has hosted various fairs and conferences, including the fifth [[Solvay Conference]] in 1927 and two world fairs: the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and the [[Expo '58]]. Brussels suffered damage from World War II, though it was minor compared to cities in Germany and the United Kingdom.

After the war, Brussels was modernized for better and for worse. The construction of the [[North–South connection]] linking the main railway stations in the city was completed in 1952, while the first [[Brussels premetro]] was finished in 1969, and the first line of the [[Brussels Metro]] was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the ''de facto'' capital of what would become the European Union, and many modern buildings were built. Unfortunately, development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural gems were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, a process known as ''[[Brusselization]]''.

The Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989 after a constitutional reform in 1970. The Brussels-Capital Region was made bilingual, and it is one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal regions of Belgium]], along with [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Belgian Constitution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIRB-creation&quot; /&gt;

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]] Brussels experiences an [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb). Brussels' proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/fr/360361-Parametres.html#ppt_757427 |title=Site de l'institut météorologique belge |publisher=Meteo.be |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is rare, generally occurring once or twice a year.

{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Charles Picqué.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Picqué]] has since 2004 been [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region]].]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Regions]] of [[Belgium]], while the [[French Community of Belgium]] and the [[Flemish Community]] do exercise, each for their part, their cultural competencies on the territory of the Region. French and Dutch are the official languages; most public services are bilingual (exceptions being education and a couple of others). The Capital Region is predominantly French-speaking—about 85–90%&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lexilogos.com/bruxelles_plan.htm Personal website ''Lexilogos'' located in the [[Provence]], on European Languages (English, French, German, Dutch, and so on) – French-speakers in Brussels are estimated at about 90% (estimation, not an 'official' number because there are no linguistic census in Belgium)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20070303005845/http://www.initiatives.refer.org/_notes/sess604.htm#_ftnref9 ''Langues majoritaires, langues minoritaires, dialectes et NTIC'' by Simon Petermann, Professor at the University of Liège, Wallonia, Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E.

===Institutions===
Because of how the federalisation was handled in Belgium, but also because the municipalities in the region did not take part in the merger that affected municipalities in the rest of Belgium in the seventies, the public institutions in Brussels offer a bewildering complexity. The complexity is more apparent in the lawbooks than in the facts, since the members of the Brussels Parliament and Government also act in other capacities, for example, as members of the council of the Brussels agglomeration or the community commissions.
One distinguishes:

====Parliament====
{{Main|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Parlement Région Bruxelles.JPG|thumb|[[Brussels Parliament building]]]]
The region, with a regional parliament of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking, parties are organised on a linguistic basis), plus a regional government, consisting of an officially linguistically neutral, but in practice French-speaking minister-president, two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. This parliament can enact ordinances (French: ''ordonnances'', Dutch: ''ordonnanties''), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

* The agglomeration, with a council and a board, with the same membership as the organs of the Brussels Region. This is a decentralised administrative public body, assuming competences that elsewhere in Belgium are exercised by municipalities or provinces (fire brigade, waste disposal). The by-laws enacted by it do not have the status of a legislative act.

* A bi-communitarian public authority, [[Common Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire commune, COCOM'', Dutch: ''Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC''), with a United Assembly (i.e. the members of the regional parliament) and a United Board (the ministers—not the secretaries of state—of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote). This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare competencies of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise competencies in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is competent for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centra for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.

* The Brussels Region is not a province, nor does it belong to one. Within the Region, 99% of the provincial competencies are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides.

* 6 inter-municipal policing zones

* intercommunal societies created freely by the municipalities

Also the federal state, the French Community and the Flemish Community exercise competencies on the territory of the region. 19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and until 2004 this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

Due to the multiple capacities of single members of parliament, there are parliamentarians who are at the same time members of the Brussels Parliament, members of the Assembly of the Common Community Commission, members of the Assembly of the French Community Commission, members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium and &quot;community senators&quot; in the [[Belgian Senate]]. At the moment, this is the case for Mr. François Roelants du Vivier (for the [[Mouvement Réformateur]]), Mrs. Amina Derbaki Sbaï (since June 2004 for the [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]], but beforehand, since 2003, for the Mouvement Réformateur) and Mrs Sfia Bouarfa (since 2001 for the Parti Socialiste).

==In Belgian politics==
[[File:Palace of Brussels.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Palace of Brussels]]]]
Despite what its name suggests, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of [[Belgium]] in itself. Article 194 of the [[Belgian Constitution]] establishes that the capital of Belgium is the [[City of Brussels]], a smaller municipality within the capital region that once was the city's core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0015.htm#E11E15 |title=Title VII |publisher=Fed-parl.be |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the City of Brussels is the official capital, the funds allotted by the federation and region for the representative role of the capital are divided among the 19 municipalities, and some national institutions are sited in the other 18 municipalities. Thus, while only the City of Brussels itself officially carries the title of capital of Belgium, in practice the entire capital region plays this role, and the national institutions of the Belgian state are spread loosely around the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Seat of the French Community and Flemish Community ==
The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside [[Wallonia]] and the [[Flemish Region]]. Geographically and linguistically, it is a (bilingual) [[enclave]] in the (unilingual) Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's complex institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants must deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French (speaking) Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

Brussels is also the capital of both the [[French Community of Belgium]] (''Communauté française de Belgique'' in French) and of [[Flanders]] (''Vlaanderen''); all Flemish capital institutions are established here: [[Flemish Parliament]], [[Flemish Government]] and its administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brussels, the capital of Flanders|url=http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1166590837731&amp;context=1166590833692--EN&amp;p=1166590837731&amp;pagename=flanders_site%2FView|publisher=Flemish Department of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=6 November 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2 community-specific public authorities, [[French Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire française or COCOF'') and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: ''Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, VGC'') for the Flemings in Brussels, with an assembly (i.e. the members of parliament of the linguistic group) and a board (the ministers and secretaries of state of the linguistic group). These commissions implement policies of the French Community and the Flemish Community in the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref name=comm&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.vgc.be/ VGC] {{fr}} [http://www.cocof.irisnet.be/site/fr/organisation/competences_htm COCOF]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative competencies of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).&lt;ref&gt;Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.&lt;ref&gt;Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.

==In international politics==
Brussels has since World War II become the administrative centre of many international organizations. Notably the European Union (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the [[Western European Union]], [[World Customs Organization]] and [[EUROCONTROL]] as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts&lt;ref name=&quot;ULB Int&quot;&gt;[http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/bxluk.html Brussels, an international city and European capital] Université Libre de Bruxelles&lt;/ref&gt; also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;diplomatie&quot;&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.be/EN/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=1754 Brussels: home to international organisations] diplomatie.be&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has for example led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;E!Sarp&quot;&gt;E!Sharp magazine, January–February 2007 issue: Article &quot;A tale of two cities&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; International schools have also been established to serve this presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;diplomatie&quot;/&gt; The &quot;international community&quot; in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Rettman |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29622 |title=Euobserver.com |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, there were an estimated 286 lobbying consultancies known to work in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leigh Phillips |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29658 |title=Euobserver.com |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels, along with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] and Strasbourg, began to host institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the &quot;[[Brussels and the European Union|European Quarter]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA COMM SEAT&quot;/&gt; Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled with little planning, the current major buildings are the [[Berlaymont building]] of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the [[Justus Lipsius building]] of the Council and the [[Espace Léopold]] of Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;EC EiB&quot;/&gt; Today the presence has increased considerably with the Commission alone occupying 865,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within the &quot;European Quarter&quot; in the east of the city (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels&lt;ref name=&quot;Demey&quot;/&gt;). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has caused a &quot;[[ghetto]] effect&quot; in that part of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUO buildings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Vucheva|first=Elitsa|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=EU quarter in Brussels set to grow|work= |publisher=EU Observer|date=5 September 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24707|doi= |accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;E!Sarp&quot;/&gt;

On 1 May 2008, the region had a population of 1,070,841 and an area of 161,382&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which gives the region a population density of 6,635 inhabitants per km².

At the last Belgian census in 1991, there were 63.7% inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region who answered they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including political refugees ([[Karl Marx]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Léon Daudet]] for example,) from neighbouring or more distanced countries as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent. And even among the Belgians, many became Belgian only recently.

The original Dutch dialect of Brussels (''Brussels'') is a form of [[Brabantic]] (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient [[Duchy of Brabant]]) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called ''Brusseleers'', many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing the Dutch language. Brussels and its suburbs evolved from a Dutch-dialect–speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines. For their French-speaking ''Bruxellois'', it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, ''Bruxellois'' (like the ''Memelländer'' in interwar ethnic censuses in [[Klaipėda|Memel]]), [[Walloons|Walloon]] (for people who migrated from the Wallonia Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels it is mainly either Flemish or ''Brusselaar'' (Dutch for an inhabitant) and often both. For the ''Brusseleers'', many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent [[immigrants]] from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.

The two largest foreign groups come from two [[francophonie|francophone]] countries: France and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region.&lt;ref name=standaard&gt;

In general the population of Brussels is younger and the gap between rich and poor is wider. Brussels also has a large concentration of Muslims, mostly of Turkish and Moroccan ancestry, and mainly French-speaking black Africans. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown, but one estimate puts the number of Muslims in Brussels at 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/5994047/Muslim-Europe-the-demographic-time-bomb-transforming-our-continent.html|title=Muslim Europe: the demographic time bomb transforming our continent|work=Telegraph|first=Adrian|last=Michaels|date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both immigration and Brussels' status as the capital of the EU made it a cosmopolitan world city. The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other EU-member states, speak many languages like French, [[Turkish language|Turkish]],
[[Arabic languages|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], Spanish, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], German, and (increasingly) English. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.

Among all major migrants groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.

Although historically (since the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] persecution and expulsion of Protestants by the Spanish in the 16th century) Roman Catholic, most people in Brussels are non-practising. About 10% of the population regularly attends church services. Among the [[religions]], historically dominant Roman Catholicism prevailing mostly in a relaxed way, one finds large minorities of [[Muslims]], [[atheism|atheists]], [[agnosticism|agnosticists]], and of the philosophical school of [[humanism]], the latter mainly as ''laïcité-vrijzinnig'' (an approximate translation would be secularists or ''free thinkers'') or practicing Humanism as a [[life stance]]—Brussels houses several key organisations for both kinds. Other (recognised) religions (Protestantism, [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] and Judaism) are practised by much smaller groups in Brussels. Recognised religions and ''[[Laïcité]]'' enjoy public funding and school courses: every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 must choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion—or ''Laïcité''—inspired morals.

Since the founding of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] ([[Brabantian]] to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically [[Belgian French]]) as the majority language and [[lingua franca]]. This language shift, the [[Frenchification of Brussels]], is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after [[Belgium]] became [[Belgian revolution|independent]] and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;service&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www2.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070105023238/http://www.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archivedate=5 January 2007 |title= Wallonie – Bruxelles, Le Service de la langue française |date=19 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;laval&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=French  |url=http://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |title=Villes, identités et médias francophones: regards croisés Belgique, Suisse, Canada |publisher=[[University of Laval]], [[Quebec]] |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only French-speaking immigration contributed to the Frenchification of Brussels; a more important cause was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was performed in Brussels by the [[Flemish people]] themselves. The main reason for this was the political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;nlb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0029.htm |title=Nederlands in België, Het Nederlands bedreigd en overlevend |author=G.

Pijnenburg, J.A. van Leuvensteijn and J.M. van der Horst |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1880 on, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century the number of monolingual French-speakers carried the day over the mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;brio4&quot;&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/btng-rbhc,%2021,%201990,%203-4,%20pp%20383-412.pdf &quot;Thuis in gescheiden werelden&quot; – De migratoire en sociale aspecten van verfransing te Brussel in het midden van de 19e eeuw&quot;], BTNG-RBHC, XXI, 1990, 3–4, pp. 383–412, Machteld de Metsenaere, Eerst aanwezend assistent en docent Vrije Universiteit Brussel&lt;/ref&gt;

Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language border]] and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbnl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001197301_01/_han001197301_01_0009.htm |title=De historische kracht van de Vlaamse beweging in België: de doelstellingen van gister, de verwezenlijkingen vandaag en de culturele aspiraties voor morgen |author=J.

Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that Brussels plays as the capital city in a bilingual country, Flemish political parties demand that the entire Brussels-Capital Region be fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. They also demand that the contested [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] arrondissement will be separated from the Brussels region. However, the French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=283113 |title=La Flandre ne prendra pas Bruxelles... |publisher=La Libre Belgique |date=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six [[municipalities with language facilities]] in the surroundings of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;The six municipalities with language facilities around Brussels are [[Wemmel]], [[Kraainem]], [[Wezembeek-Oppem]], [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Linkebeek]] and [[Drogenbos]].&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals.&lt;ref name=&quot;question&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=202792 |title=Une question: partir ou rester? |publisher=[[La Libre Belgique]] |date=24 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.uniondesfrancophones.be/ |title=Position commune des partis démocratiques francophones |publisher=[[Union des Francophones]] (UF), Province of [[Flemish Brabant]] |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://info.france2.fr/dossiers/europe/34025346-fr.php?page=7 |title=Bruxelles-capitale: une forte identité |publisher=[[France 2]] |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Architecture===

[[File:Maisons Grand-Place BXL 01.JPG|right|thumb|Guildhalls on the [[Grand Place]]]]
The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the medieval constructions on the [[Grand Place]] to the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] buildings of the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU institutions]].

Main attractions include the [[Grand Place]], since 1988 a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], with the Gothic town hall in the old centre, the [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral]] and the [[Royal Castle of Laken|Laken Castle]] with its large greenhouses. Another famous landmark is the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]].

The [[Atomium]] is a symbolic {{convert|103|m|ft|0|sing=on}} tall structure that was built for the [[Expo '58|1958 World’s Fair]]. It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a [[unit cell]]). The architect A. Waterkeyn devoted the building to science. Next to the Atomium is the [[Mini-Europe]] park with 1:25 scale [[maquette]]s of famous buildings from across Europe.

The [[Manneken Pis]], a bronze fountain of a small peeing boy is a famous tourist attraction and symbol of the city.

Other landmarks include the [[Cinquantenaire|Cinquantenaire park]] with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]], [[Brussels Stock Exchange]], the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palace of Justice]] and the buildings of EU institutions in the [[Brussels and the European Union|European Quarter]].

[[File:Cinquantenaire.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cinquantenaire]] triumphal arch]]

Cultural facilities include the Brussels Theatre and the [[La Monnaie]] Theatre and opera house. There is a wide array of museums, from the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museum of Fine Art]] to the [[Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History|Museum of the Army]] and the [[Centre Belge de la Bande Dessinée|Comic Museum]]. Brussels also has a lively music scene, with everything from opera houses and concert halls to music bars and techno clubs.

The city centre is notable for its Flemish town houses. Also particularly striking are the buildings in the [[Art Nouveau]] style by the Brussels architect [[Victor Horta]]. Some of Brussels' districts were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau, and many buildings are in this style. Good examples include [[Schaerbeek]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]], and [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]]. Another example of Brussels Art Nouveau is the [[Stoclet Palace]], by the Viennese architect [[Josef Hoffmann]]. The modern buildings of [[Espace Leopold]] complete the picture.

[[File:Atomium 20-08-07.jpg|thumb|The [[Atomium]] in [[Heysel Park]]]]

===Arts===
The city has had a renowned artist scene for many years. The famous Belgian surrealist [[René Magritte]], for instance, studied in Brussels. The city was also home of Impressionist painters like [[Anna Boch]] from the Artist Group [[Les XX]]. The city is also a capital of the comic strip;&lt;ref name=Comic&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbez|first=Ariel|title=Bruxelles, capitale de la BD|url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/73a8ca52-4c90-11de-8192-71ce8207b7fa|accessdate=28 May 2010|newspaper=Le Temps|date=30 May 2009|location=Switzerland|language=French|quote=Plus que jamais, Bruxelles mérite son statut de capitale de la bande dessinée. }}&lt;/ref&gt; some treasured Belgian characters are [[Lucky Luke]], [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Cubitus]], [[Gaston Lagaffe]] and [[Marsupilami]]. Throughout the city walls are painted with large motifs of comic book characters, and the interiors of some Metro stations are designed by artists. The [[Centre Belge de la Bande Dessinée|Belgian Comics Museum]] combines two artistic leitmotifs of Brussels, being a museum devoted to Belgian comic strips, housed in the former Waucquez department store, designed by [[Victor Horta]] in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.

Brussels contains over 80 museums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/tourismeloisirs/tourisme_et_loisirs/les_musees_de_bruxelles.shtml |title=Museums in Brussels |publisher=Bruxelles.irisnet.be |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Museum of Modern Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trabel.com/brussel/brussels-museums-modernart.htm |title=Museum of Modern Art in Brussels. Museum Moderne Kunst Brussel. Musée d'art moderne Bruxelles |publisher=Trabel.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. The museum has an extensive collection of various painters, such as the [[Flemish painting|Flemish painters]] like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. The recently opened [[Magritte Museum]] houses the world's largest collection of the works of the surrealist [[René Magritte]].

The [[King Baudouin Stadium]] is a concert and competition facility with a 50,000 seat capacity, the largest in Belgium. The site was formerly occupied by the [[Heysel Stadium]].

===Gastronomy===
[[File:Brussels waffle.jpg|thumb|upright|Brussels is known for its local [[waffle]] (pictured) and chocolate.]]
Brussels is known for its local [[waffle]], its chocolate, its [[French fries]] and its numerous types of beers. The [[Brussels sprout]] was first cultivated in Brussels, hence its name.

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 restaurants, and a number of high quality bars. Belgian cuisine is known among connoisseurs {{Who|date=March 2009}} as one of the best in Europe.{{Weasel-inline|date=November 2010}} In addition to the traditional restaurants, there is a large number of cafés, bistros, and the usual range of international fast food chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; coffee houses are called the Salons de Thé. Also widespread are ''brasseries'', which usually offer a large number of beers and typical national dishes.

Belgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of [[French cuisine]] with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include [[Brussels waffle]]s (gaufres) and [[mussels]] (usually as &quot;[[moules frites]]&quot;, served with fries). The city is a stronghold of chocolate and pralines manufacturers with renowned companies like [[Chocolatier Neuhaus|Neuhaus]], [[Leonidas (chocolate maker)|Leonidas]] and [[Godiva Chocolatier|Godiva]]. Numerous [[friteries]] are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh, hot, waffles are also sold on the street.

In addition to the regular selection of [[Belgian beer]], the famous [[lambic]] style of beer is only brewed in and around Brussels, and the yeasts have their origin in the [[Senne]] valley. In mild contrast to the other versions, [[Kriek]] (cherry beer) enjoys outstanding popularity, as it does in the rest of Belgium. Kriek is available in almost every bar or restaurant.

==Economy==
[[File:Bourse Bxl 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Brussels Stock Exchange]]]]
{{See|Economy of Belgium}}
Serving as the centre of administration for Europe, Brussels' economy is largely service-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of multinationals, by European institutions, by various administrations, and by related services, though it does have a number of notable craft industries, such as the [[Cantillon Brewery]], a [[lambic]] brewery founded in 1900.

==Education==
[[File:ULB 20050712.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]]]
There are several [[university|universities]] in Brussels. The two main universities are the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]], a French-speaking university with about 20,000 students in three campuses in the city (and two others outside),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation of the Université libre de Bruxelles|publisher=[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/indexuk.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], a [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] university with about 10,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the University: Culture and History|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both universities originate from a single ancestor university founded in 1834, namely the Free University of Brussels, which was split in 1970 at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organisation of higher education.

Other universities include the [[Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis]] with 2,000 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institution: Historique|publisher=Facultés Universitaires Saint Louis|url=http://www.fusl.ac.be/fr/27.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel]], the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], a military college established in 1834 by a French colonel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes the RMA so special?|publisher=[[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Belgian Royal Military Academy]]|url=http://www.rma.ac.be/RMAdotNet/scsc/infos/default.aspx?Page=1&amp;SubPage=3|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071228233044/http://www.rma.ac.be/RMAdotNet/scsc/infos/default.aspx?Page=1&amp;SubPage=3|archivedate=28 December 2007|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two drama schools founded in 1982: the French-speaking [[Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|Conservatoire Royal]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petite histoire du Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|publisher=Conservatoire Royal|url=http://www.conservatoire.be/historique.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel|publisher=[[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]]|url=http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&amp;nr=1|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]] that has had its medical faculty in the city since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'histoire de l'UCL à Bruxelles|publisher=[[Université Catholique de Louvain]]|url=http://www.uclouvain.be/47547.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the University of Kent's [[Brussels School of International Studies]] is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies and [[Boston University Brussels]] was established in 1972 and offers masters degrees in business administration and international relations. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the [[International School of Brussels]] with 1,450 pupils between 2½ and 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISB Profile|publisher=[[International School of Brussels]]|url=http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British School of Brussels, and the four [[European School]]s, which provide free education for the children of those working in the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]]. The combined student population of the four [[European School]]s in Brussels is currently around 10 000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background |publisher=[[European Schools|Schola Europaea]]|url=http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=133|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
:''main article:'' [[Transport in Brussels]]
[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ''(''[[Intercity-Express|ICE]]'' train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured)'']]

===Air===
Brussels is served by [[Brussels Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], and by the smaller [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located near [[Charleroi]] (Wallonia), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} from Brussels. Brussels is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to London by the [[Eurostar]] train via the Channel Tunnel (1hr 51 min); to Amsterdam, Paris (1hr 25 min) and Cologne by the [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne and Frankfurt by the German [[InterCityExpress|ICE]].

===Water===
Brussels also has its own port on the [[Brussels-Scheldt Maritime Canal]] located in the northwest of the city. The [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] connects Brussels with the industrial areas of [[Wallonia]].

===Public transport===
The [[Brussels Metro]] dates back to 1976, but underground lines known as ''premetro'' have been serviced by tramways since 1968. A comprehensive bus and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] also covers the city.

An interticketing system means that a [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|STIB]] ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the city. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|SNCB/NMBS]] will in the next few years be augmented by the [[Brussels RER]] network around the city.

Since 2003 Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company Cambio in partnership with the [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|STIB]] and local ridesharing company taxi stop. In 2006 shared bicycles were also introduced.

===Road network===
[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|[[Rue de la Loi]] is one of the city's main streets]]
In medieval times Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east-west (Chaussée de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du Marché aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets radiating from the [[Grand Place]] in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built [[covering of the Senne|over the River Senne]], [[small ring (Brussels)|over the city walls]] and over the [[North-South connection|railway connection between the North and South Stations]].

As one expects of a capital city, Brussels is the hub of the fan of old national roads, the principal ones being clockwise the N1 (N to [[Breda]]), N2 (E to [[Maastricht]]), N3 (E to [[Aachen]]), N4 (SE to [[Luxembourg]]) N5 (S to [[Rheims]]), N6 (SW to [[Maubeuge]]), N8 (W to [[Koksijde]]) and N9 (NW to [[Ostend]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?/nb.html |title=Belgian N roads |publisher=Autosnelwegen.net |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually named ''chaussées/steenwegen'', these highways normally run in a straight line, but on occasion lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The town is skirted by the [[European route E19]] (N-S) and the [[European route E40|E40]] (E-W), while the [[E411]] leads away to the SE. Brussels has an [[beltway|orbital motorway]], numbered ''R0'' (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the &quot;ring&quot; (French: ''ring'' Dutch: ''grote ring''). It is pear-shaped as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as &quot;the pentagon&quot;, is surrounded by an inner ring road, the &quot;[[small ring (Brussels)|small ring]]&quot; (French: ''petite ceinture'', Dutch: ''kleine ring'' ), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered ''R20''. These were built upon the site of the [[second walls of Brussels|second set of city walls]] following their demolition. Metro line 2 runs under much of these.

On the eastern side of the city, the ''R21'' (French: ''[[Greater ring (Brussels)|grande ceinture]]'', ''grote ring'' in Dutch) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from Laeken ([[Laken]]) to Uccle ([[Ukkel]]). Some ''premetro'' stations (see [[Brussels Metro]]) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to [[Saint-Job]].

[[Image:Lucent HQ.gif|thumb|right|240px|Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill, New Jersey]]

'''Bell Laboratories''' (also known as '''Bell Labs''' and formerly known as '''AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories''' and '''Bell Telephone Laboratories''') is the [[research and development]] subsidiary of the French-owned [[Alcatel-Lucent]] and previously of the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T). 

&lt;!-- I would suggest maybe moving this locations section to a full section? --&gt;
Bell Laboratories operates its headquarters at [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]], [[United States]], and has research and development facilities throughout the world.

{{main|Volta Laboratory and Bureau}}

[[File:Volta Laboratory and Bureau nw22.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alternatetext: An oblique view of a large salmon coloured two story stone building, of some prominence|Bell's 1893 Volta Bureau building in Washington, D.C.]] 

The [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory]], also variously known as the '''Volta Bureau''', the '''Bell Carriage House''', the '''Bell Laboratory''' and the '''Volta Laboratory''', was created in [[Washington, D.C.]] by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].

In 1880, the [[France|French government]] awarded Bell the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 francs for the [[invention of the telephone]], which he used to found the Volta Laboratory, along with [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin [[Chichester Bell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce1990&quot;&gt;Bruce, Robert V. ''Bell: Alexander Bell and the Conquest of Solitude''. Ithaca, New York: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]], 1990. ISBN 0-80149691-8.&lt;/ref&gt; His research laboratory focused on the analysis, recording and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the &quot;[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce1990&quot; /&gt; 

The Volta Laboratory and the Volta Bureau were earlier located at [[Alexander Melville Bell|Bell's father]]'s house at 1527 35th Street in Washington, D.C., where its carriage house became their headquarters in 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce1990&quot; /&gt; In 1893 Bell constructed a new building (close by at 1537 35th St.) specifically to house it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce1990&quot; /&gt; The building was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhlsum&quot;&gt;

=== Early antecedent ===

In 1884 the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] created its Mechanical Department from the Electrical and Patent Department formed a year earlier.

=== Formal organization ===

In 1925 Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of the engineering department of the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]] company (AT&amp;T) were consolidated to form Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., as a separate entity. The first president of research was [[Frank B. Jewett]], who stayed there until 1940. The ownership of Bell Laboratories was evenly split between AT&amp;T and the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Company]]. Its principal work was to design and support the equipment that Western Electric built for [[Bell System]] operating companies, including [[telephone exchange|telephone exchange switch]]es. Support work for the phone companies included the writing and maintaining of the Bell System Practices (BSP), a comprehensive series of technical manuals. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone Companies]], and U.S. government work, including [[Project Nike]] and the [[Apollo program]]. A few workers were assigned to basic research, and this attracted much attention, especially since they produced several [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Until the 1940s, the company's principal locations were in and around the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|Bell Labs Building]] in [[New York City]], but many of these were moved to New York suburban areas of [[New Jersey]].

Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], [[Holmdel, New Jersey|Holmdel]], [[Crawford Hill, New Jersey|Crawford Hill]], the [[Deal Test Site]], [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Lincroft, New Jersey|Lincroft]], [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]], [[Middletown, New Jersey|Middletown]], [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]], [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], and [[Whippany, New Jersey|Whippany]]. Of these, [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], [[Crawford Hill, New Jersey|Crawford Hill]], and [[Whippany, New Jersey|Whippany]] remain in existence. The largest grouping of people in the company was in [[Illinois]], at [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]-[[Lisle, Illinois|Lisle]], in the [[Chicago]] area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[North Andover, Massachusetts]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], and [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania]], Burlington, North Carolina (1950s–1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and [[Westminster, Colorado]]. Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down, or shut down entirely.

== Discoveries and developments  ==
[[Image:BellLabs.PNG|thumb|right|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1969 until 1983]]

At its peak, Bell Laboratories was the premier facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], [[information theory]], the [[UNIX]] [[operating system]], the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and the [[C++|C++ programming language]]. Seven [[Nobel Prize]]s have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/BellLabs/AwardsandRecognition#tabAnchor2 List of Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1937: [[Clinton Davisson|Clinton J. Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter.
* 1956: [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter H. Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]] received the Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the first [[transistor]]s.
* 1977: [[Philip W. Anderson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing an improved understanding of the electronic structure of glass and magnetic materials.
* 1978: [[Arno A. Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert W. Wilson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. Penzias and Wilson were cited for their discovery of [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], a nearly uniform glow that fills the [[Universe]] in the microwave band of the radio spectrum.
* 1997: [[Steven Chu]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light.
* 1998: [[Horst Stormer]], [[Robert Laughlin]], and [[Daniel Tsui]], were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and explanation of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].
* 2009: [[Willard S. Boyle]], [[George E. Smith]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics together with [[Charles K. Kao]]. Boyle and Smith were cited for the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit—the [[CCD sensor]].

=== 1920s ===
During its first year of operation, facsimile ([[fax]]) transmission, invented elsewhere, was first demonstrated publicly by the Bell Laboratories.&lt;!-- As a result of this research? --&gt; In 1926, the laboratories invented an early example [[Sound film|synchronous-sound motion picture]] system, in competition with [[Movietone sound system|Fox Movietone]] and [[Phonofilm|DeForest Phonofilm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015241 Encyclopædia Britannica Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Bell Labs physicist Dr. [[Walter A. Shewhart]] proposed the [[control chart]] as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewart's methods were the basis for [[statistical process control]] (SPC)—the use of statistically-based tools and techniques for the management and improvement of processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including the [[Six Sigma]] one.

In 1927, a Bell team headed by [[Herbert E. Ives]] successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line [[television]] images of [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]] from Washington to New York. In 1928 the [[thermal noise]] in a resistor was first measured by [[John B. Johnson]], and [[Harry Nyquist]] provided the theoretical analysis. (This is now referred to as &quot;Johnson noise&quot;.) During the 1920s, the [[one-time pad]] [[cipher]] was invented by [[Gilbert Vernam]] and [[Joseph Mauborgne]] at the laboratories. Bell Labs' [[Claude Shannon]] later proved that it is unbreakable.

=== 1930s ===
[[File:Green Banks - Jansky Antena.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the directional antenna used in the discovery of radio emission of extraterrestrial origin by [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1932.]]

In 1931, a foundation for [[radio astronomy]] was laid by [[Karl Jansky]] during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance shortwave communications. He discovered that [[radio]] waves were being emitted from the center of the [[galaxy]]. In 1933, [[Stereophonic sound|stereo signals]] were transmitted live from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Washington, DC]]. In 1937, the [[vocoder]], the first electronic [[speech synthesizer]] was invented and demonstrated by [[Homer Dudley]]. Bell researcher [[Clinton Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with [[George Paget Thomson]] for the discovery of [[electron diffraction]], which helped lay the foundation for [[solid-state electronics]].

=== 1940s ===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[transistor]], a [[point-contact transistor|point-contact]] [[germanium]] device, was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947.  This image shows a replica.]]

In the early 1940s, the [[photovoltaic cell]] was developed by [[Russell Ohl]]. In 1943, Bell developed [[SIGSALY]], the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. In 1947, the [[transistor]], probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Bradford Shockley]] (and who subsequently shared the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1956). In 1947, [[Richard Hamming]] invented [[Hamming code]]s for [[error detection and correction]]. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, &quot;[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]&quot;, one of the founding works in [[information theory]], was published by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]], but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of [[History of cryptography|modern cryptography]] with his 1949 paper ''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]''.

==== Calculators ====

*Model I: A Complex Number Calculator, completed January 1940, for doing calculations of [[complex numbers]]. See [[George Stibitz]].

*Model VI: November 1950, an enhanced Model V

=== 1950s ===
[[File:Visual Binary.jpg|thumb|Visual Binary]]
The 1950s saw developmental activity based upon information theory. The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including Visual Binary encoding, N-carrier, TD [[Microwave radio relay]], [[Direct Distance Dialing]], E-[[repeaters]], [[Wire spring relay]]s, and [[5XB switch|improved switching]] systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the [[Karnaugh map]] as a tool to facilitate management of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebraic]] expressions. In 1954, The first modern [[solar cell]] was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 [[TAT-1]], the first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by [[AT&amp;T]], Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.&lt;!-- What was Bell Labs' involvement in that?--&gt; A year later, in 1957, [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC]], one of the first computer programs to play [[electronic music]], was created by [[Max Mathews]]. New [[greedy algorithm]]s developed by [[Robert C. Prim]] and [[Joseph Kruskal]], revolutionized [[computer network]] design. In 1958, the [[laser]] was first described, in a technical paper by [[Arthur Schawlow]] and [[Charles Hard Townes]].

=== 1960s ===

In 1960, Dawon Kahng and Martin Atalla invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the [[Integrated circuit#LSI|large-scale integrated circuits]] (LSIs) underlying today's information society. In 1962, the [[electret microphone]] was invented by [[Gerhard Sessler|Gerhard M. Sessler]] and [[James Edward Maceo West]]. In 1964, the [[Carbon dioxide laser]] was invented by [[Kumar Patel]]. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]], for which they were awarded the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/ Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978]. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, and Kenneth C. Knowlton made computer-animated movies during the early to mid 1960s. In 1966, [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] was developed by [[J.R. Arthur]] and [[A.Y. Cho]]; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, the [[UNIX]] operating system was created by [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]]. The [[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) was invented in 1969 by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]], for which they were awarded the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/ Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009]. In the 1960s, the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|New York City site]] was sold and became the [[Westbeth Artists Community]] complex.

=== 1970s ===
[[Image:K&amp;R C.jpg|left|thumb|The C programming language was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1970]]

The 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the [[personal computing]] revolution. In 1970 [[Dennis Ritchie]] developed the compiled [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] as a replacement for the interpretive [[B (programming language)|B]] for use in writing the [[Unix|UNIX]] operating system (also developed at Bell Laboratories). The original version of UNIX [[awk]] was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.

In 1970, [[A. Michael Noll]] patented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized [[telephone exchange|switching system]]s for telephone traffic was invented by [[Erna Schneider Hoover]], who received one of the first [[software patent]]s for it. In 1976, [[Fiber optic]]s systems were first tested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and in 1980, the first single-chip [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]], the BELLMAC-32A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.

The 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and transistor-transistor logic (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; 1A/#4 TOLL Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced the floor space required. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that required only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;!-- Fact tag for the whole paragraph --&gt;

=== 1980s ===
[[File:Bell Labs logo, 1984-1995.png|frame|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1984 until 1995]]

In 1980, the [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[CDMA]] digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, [[Fractional quantum Hall effect]] was discovered by [[Horst Ludwig Störmer|Horst Störmer]] and former Bell Laboratories researchers [[Robert B. Laughlin]] and [[Daniel C. Tsui]]; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery. In 1983, the [[C++]] programming language was developed by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] as an extension to the original C programming language also developed at Bell Laboratories.

In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna now becomes an important component in [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. In 1984, the [[Karmarkar's algorithm|Karmarkar Linear Programming Algorithm]] was developed by mathematician [[Narendra Karmarkar]]. Also in 1984, [[Modification of Final Judgment|a divestiture agreement]] signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&amp;T: [[Bellcore]] (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&amp;D functions for the newly created [[local exchange carrier]]s. [[AT&amp;T]] also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. '''Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.''', was then renamed '''AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Inc.''', and became a wholly owned company of the new [[AT&amp;T Technologies]] unit, the former [[Western Electric]]. The [[5ESS Switch]] was developed during this transition. In 1985, [[laser cooling]] was used to slow and manipulate atoms by [[Steven Chu]] and team. Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]] &quot;For contribution over decades to modern communication systems&quot;. During the 1980s, the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9 operating system]] was developed as a replacement for [[Unix]] which was also developed at Bell Laboratories in 1969. Development of the [[Radiodrum]], a three dimensional electronic instrument&lt;!-- vague statement! --&gt;. In 1988, [[TAT-8]] became the first fiber optic transatlantic cable.

=== 1990s ===
[[Image:Lucent Technologies logo.svg|thumb|200px|Lucent Logo, bearing the &quot;Bell Labs Innovations&quot; tagline]] 

In 1990, [[WaveLAN]], the first [[wireless]] [[local area network]] (WLAN) was developed at Bell Laboratories. Wireless network technology would not become popular until the late 1990s and was first demonstrated in 1995.{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- I went to a show in 1994 &amp; the technology may have been demoed before that~~~~ --&gt; Also in 1990, the [[AMPL|AMPL modeling language]] was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David M. Gay and [[Brian Kernighan|Brian W. Kernighan]] at Bell Laboratories. In 1991, the 56K [[modem]] technology was patented by Nuri Dağdeviren and his team. In 1994, the [[quantum cascade laser]] was invented by [[Federico Capasso]], [[Alfred Cho]], Jerome Faist and their collaborators and was later greatly improved by the innovations of [[Claire Gmachl]]. Also in 1994, [[Peter Shor]] devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL [[lithography|electron lithography]], which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno operating system]], an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the new [[concurrent programming language|concurrent]] [[Limbo programming language]]. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bell-labs.com/project/dali/ Dali main-memory storage manager home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment-manufacturing business, into a new company named [[Alcatel-Lucent|Lucent Technologies]]. AT&amp;T retained a smaller number of researchers, who made up the staff of the newly-created [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]]. In 1997, the smallest practical transistor (60 [[nanometer]]s, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first [[Optical IP Switching|optical router]] was invented {{Dubious|date=November 2009}} and the first combination of voice and data traffic on an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network was developed at the Laboratories.{{clarify|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== 2000s ===
[[Image:Alcatel Lucent Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Logo of Alcatel-Lucent, holding the Bell Labs now]] 

2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which [[DNA machine]] prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered [[Dye laser|organic laser]] invented; a large-scale map of cosmic [[dark matter]] was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes plastic transistors possible, was invented. 

In 2002, [[physicist]] [[Jan Hendrik Schön]], was fired after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.

In 2003, the New Jersey Institute of Technology Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njnano.org/resources/index.shtml New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium. Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Jeong H. Kim|Dr. Jeong Kim]], former President of Lucent's Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.

In April 2006, Bell Laboratories's parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with [[Alcatel]]. On December 1, 2006, the merged company, [[Alcatel-Lucent]], began operations. This deal raised concerns in the [[United States]], where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, [http://www.lgsinnovations.com LGS], with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive [[U.S. Government]] contracts.

In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs.

As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics basic research according to a report by the scientific journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html |title=Access : Bell Labs bottoms out : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date= |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |title=Bell Labs Kills Fundamental Physics Research |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2008-08-28 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bjarne Stroustrup''' ({{IPA-da|ˈbjɑːnə ˈsdʁʌʊ̯ˀsdʁɔb}}, {{IPA-en|-strustrɔp}} or {{IPA-en|-straʊstrɔp|}})&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html#pronounce&lt;/ref&gt;; born December 30, 1950 in [[Århus]], [[Denmark]]) is a Danish [[computer scientist]], most notable for the creation and the development of the widely used [[C++]] programming language. He is currently Professor and holder of the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.att.com/~bs/homepage.html Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1979 (then called &quot;[[C (programming language)|C]] with Classes&quot;), and, in his own words, &quot;invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation... chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The C++ Programming Language'', B. Stroustrup, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Stroustrup also wrote what many consider to be the standard text for the language, ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]'', which is now in its third edition. The text has been revised twice to reflect the evolution of the language and the work of the C++ standards committee.

==Education and academic work==
Stroustrup has a [[master's degree]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] (1975) from the [[University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in computer science (1979) from the [[University of Cambridge]], England, where he was a student at [[Churchill College]]. He was the head of [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Lab's]] Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. Stroustrup was elected member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 2004. He is a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] (1994) and an [[IEEE]] Fellow. He currently works at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[United States]], as a Professor where he holds the College of Engineering Chair in [[Computer Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bio.html Bjarne Stroustrup: Some Information about Bjarne Stroustrup.

[[Image:Chimp Brain in a jar.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A brain floating in a liquid-filled glass jar. Yellowing of the handwritten labels on the jar give the object an antique appearance.|A [[chimpanzee]] brain]]
The '''brain''' is the center of the [[nervous system]] in all [[vertebrate]] and most [[invertebrate]] animals.&lt;ref name=Shepard&gt;[[#refShepherdNB|Shepherd, ''Neurobiology'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Some primitive animals such as [[cnidarian|jellyfish]] and [[echinoderm|starfish]] have a decentralized nervous system without a brain, while [[sponge]]s lack any nervous system at all. In vertebrates the brain is located in the [[head]], protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception|balance]], [[gustation|taste]], and [[olfaction|smell]].

Brains can be extremely complex. The [[cerebral cortex]] of the [[human brain]] contains roughly 15–33 billion [[neuron]]s, perhaps more, depending on gender and age,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPelvig|Pelvig et al., 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; linked with up to 10,000 [[synapse|synaptic]] connections each.  Each [[cubic millimeter]] of cerebral cortex contains roughly one billion synapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAlonsoNanclares|AlonsoNanclares et al., 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called [[axon]]s, which carry trains of signal pulses called [[action potential]]s to distant parts of the brain or body and target them to specific recipient cells.

The brain controls the other [[organ systems]] of the body, either by activating muscles or by causing secretion of chemicals such as [[hormone]]s and [[neurotransmitters]].  This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.  Some basic types of responsiveness are possible without a brain: even single-celled organisms may be capable of extracting information from the environment and acting in response to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGehring|Gehring, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sponge]]s, which lack a [[central nervous system]], are capable of coordinated body contractions and even [[locomotion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNickel|Nickel, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In vertebrates, the [[spinal cord]] by itself contains neural circuitry capable of generating reflex responses as well as simple motor patterns such as swimming or walking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGrillnerWallen|Grillner &amp; Wallén, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, sophisticated control of behavior on the basis of complex sensory input requires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.

Despite rapid scientific progress, much about how brains work remains a mystery. The operations of individual neurons and synapses are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of thousands or millions has been very difficult to decipher. Methods of observation such as [[EEG]] recording and [[neuroimaging|functional brain imaging]] tell us that brain operations are highly organized, while [[single unit recording]] can resolve the activity of single neurons, but how individual cells give rise to complex operations is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSystems|Sejnowski, ''23 Problems in Systems Neuroscience'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain is the most complex biological structure known,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShepherdNB|Shepherd, ''Neurobiology'']], p 3&lt;/ref&gt; and comparing the brains of different species on the basis of appearance is often difficult.  Nevertheless, there are common principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species.  These are revealed mainly by three approaches. The [[evolution of the brain|evolutionary]] approach compares brain structures of different species, and using the principle that features found in all branches that have descended from a given ancient form were probably present in the common ancestor as well. The [[developmental neuroscience|developmental]] approach examines how the form of the brain changes during the progression from embryonic to adult stages.  The [[molecular neuroscience|genetic]] approach analyzes gene expression in various parts of the brain across a range of species. Each approach complements and informs the other two.

===Bilateria===
[[Image:Bilaterian-plan.svg|thumb|right|alt=A rod-shaped body contains a digestive system running from the mouth at one end to the anus at the other. Alongside the digestive system is a nerve cord with a brain at the end, near to the mouth. |Nervous system of a bilaterian animal, in the form of a nerve cord with segmental enlargements, and a &quot;brain&quot; at the front]]
With the exception of a few primitive forms such as sponges and [[jellyfish]], all living animals are [[bilateria]], meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other).&lt;ref name=Urbilateria /&gt;

All bilateria are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the [[Cambrian]] period, 550–600 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Urbilateria&gt;[[#refUrbilateria|Balavoine &amp; Adoutte, 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This ancestor had the shape of a simple tube worm with a segmented body, and at an abstract level, that worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system plans of all modern bilateria, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEvolutionOfOrganSystems|Schmidt-Rhaesa, ''Evolution of Organ Systems'']], p 110&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from mouth to anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a [[ganglion]]) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain.  There are, however, a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including [[echinoderm]]s, [[tunicate]]s, and a group of primitive flatworms called ''[[acoelomorpha]]''.  It has not been definitively established whether these species indicate that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain, or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.&lt;ref name=Mwinyi&gt;[[#refMwinyi|Mwinyi ''et al.'', 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrates===
[[Image:Shark brain.png|thumb|right|alt=A T-shaped object is made up of the cord at the bottom which feeds into a lower central mass. This is topped by a larger central mass with an arm extending from either side. |The brain of a [[shark]]]]
The brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue, with a texture that has been compared to [[Jell-O]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of neural science'']], Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color.  Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of [[connective tissue]] [[Biological membrane|membrane]]s called [[meninges]] that separate the skull from the brain.&lt;ref name=CarpenterCh1&gt;[[#refCarpenter|''Carpenter's Human Neuroanatomy'']], Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the [[dura mater]] (&quot;hard mother&quot;), [[arachnoid mater]] (&quot;spidery mother&quot;), and [[pia mater]] (&quot;soft mother&quot;). The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the pia-arachnoid. Below the arachnoid is the subarachnoid space which contains [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), which circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through cavities called [[Ventricular system|ventricle]]s, and serves to nourish, support, and protect the brain tissue. [[Blood vessel]]s enter the central nervous system through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the [[blood-brain barrier]] which protects the brain from [[toxin]]s that might enter through the blood.

The first [[vertebrate]]s appeared over 500&amp;nbsp;million years ago ([[mya (unit)|mya]]), during the Cambrian period, and may have somewhat resembled the modern [[hagfish]] in form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShu2003|Shu et al., 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharks appeared about 450&amp;nbsp;mya, amphibians about 400&amp;nbsp;mya, reptiles about 350&amp;nbsp;mya, and mammals about 200&amp;nbsp;mya. No modern species should be described as more &quot;primitive&quot; than others, since all have an equally long [[evolution|evolutionary history]], but the brains of modern hagfishes, [[lampreys]], sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStriedter|Striedter, ''Principles of Brain Evolution'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in hagfishes, whereas in mammals the foremost parts are greatly elaborated and expanded.

All vertebrate brains share a common underlying form, which can most easily be appreciated by examining how they develop.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], p 1019&lt;/ref&gt;  The first appearance of the nervous system is as a thin strip of tissue running along the back of the [[embryo]].  This strip thickens and then folds up to form a hollow tube.  The front end of the tube develops into the brain.  In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings, which eventually become the [[forebrain]], [[midbrain]], and [[hindbrain]].  In many classes of vertebrates these three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain quite small.

The relationship between [[brain size]], body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species. Brain size increases with body size but not proportionally. Averaging across all orders of mammals, it follows a [[power law]], with an [[exponent]] of about 0.75.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refArmstrong|Armstrong, 1983]]&lt;/ref&gt; This formula applies to the average brain of mammals but each family departs from it, reflecting their sophistication of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJerison|Jerison, ''Evolution of the Brain and Intelligence'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times as large as the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains. When the mammalian brain increases in size, not all parts increase at the same rate. The larger the brain of a species, the greater the fraction taken up by the cortex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay&quot;&gt;[[#refFinlay|Finlay et al., 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertebrate brain regions====

Neuroanatomists usually consider the brain to consist of six main regions:  the [[cerebrum|telencephalon]] (cerebral hemispheres), [[diencephalon]] (thalamus and hypothalamus), [[mesencephalon]] (midbrain), [[cerebellum]], [[pons]], and [[medulla oblongata]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these areas in turn has a complex internal structure.  Some areas, such as the cortex and cerebellum, consist of layers, folded or convoluted to fit within the available space.  Other areas consist of clusters of many small nuclei.  If fine distinctions are made on the basis of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity, thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain.

Some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial changes in brain shape, especially in the forebrain.  The brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way, but in [[teleost]] fishes (the great majority of modern species), the forebrain has become &quot;everted&quot;, like a sock turned inside out.  In birds, also, there are major changes in shape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNorthcutt2008|Northcutt, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the main structures in the avian forebrain, the dorsal ventricular ridge, was long thought to correspond to the basal ganglia of mammals, but is now thought to be more closely related to the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refReiner|Reiner et al., 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vertebrate-brain-regions.png|thumb|left|alt=Corresponding regions of human and shark brain are shown. The shark brain is splayed out, while the human brain is more compact. The shark brain starts with the medulla, which is surrounded by various structures, and ends with the telencephalon. The cross-section of the human brain shows the medulla at the bottom surrounded by the same structures, with the telencephalon thickly coating the top of the brain. |Main anatomical regions of the vertebrate brain]]

Several brain areas have maintained their identities across the whole range of vertebrates, from hagfishes to humans.&lt;ref name=Shepard /&gt;  Here is a list of some of the most important areas, along with a very brief description of their functions as currently understood (but note that the functions of most of them are still disputed to some degree):
*The [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], along with the spinal cord, contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and motor functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 44, 45&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[hypothalamus]] is a small region at the base of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size.  It is composed of numerous small nuclei, each with distinct connections and distinct neurochemistry.  The hypothalamus is the central control station for sleep/wake cycles, control of eating and drinking, control of hormone release, and many other critical biological functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSwaab|Swaab et al., ''The Human Hypothalamus'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Like the hypothalamus, the [[thalamus]] is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions.  Some of them are involved in relaying information to and from the cerebral hemispheres.  Others are involved in motivation.  The subthalamic area ([[zona incerta]]) seems to contain action-generating systems for several types of &quot;consummatory&quot; behaviors, including eating, drinking, defecation, and copulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refThalamus|Jones, ''The Thalamus'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[cerebellum]] modulates the outputs of other brain systems to make them more precise.  Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy.  This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error.  Learning how to ride a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum.&lt;ref name=&quot;refprinciples&quot;&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[tectum]], often called &quot;optic tectum&quot;, allows actions to be directed toward points in space.  In mammals it is called the &quot;superior colliculus&quot;, and its best studied function is to direct eye movements.  It also directs reaching movements, though.  It gets strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls, input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes, etc.  In some fishes, such as lampreys, it is the largest part of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSaitoh|Saitoh et al., 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallium]] is a layer of gray matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain.  In reptiles and mammals it is called [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] instead.  The pallium is involved in multiple functions, including [[olfaction]] and [[spatial memory]].  In mammals, where it comes to dominate the brain, it subsumes functions from many subcortical areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPuelles|Puelles, 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[hippocampus]], strictly speaking, is found only in mammals.  However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates.  There is evidence that this part of the brain is involved in spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSalas|Salas et al., 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[basal ganglia]] are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain, of which our understanding has increased enormously over the last few years.  The primary function of the basal ganglia seems to be [[action selection]].  They send inhibitory signals to all parts of the brain that can generate actions, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions.  Rewards and punishments exert their most important neural effects within the basal ganglia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGrillner2005|Grillner et al., 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[olfactory bulb]] is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals, and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium.  It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but much reduced in primates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNorthcutt1981|Northcutt, 1981]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals from other vertebrates, primates from other mammals, and humans from other primates.  The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is not only greatly enlarged, but also altered in structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBarton|Barton &amp; Harvey, 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the [[cerebrum]] is lined with a comparatively simple layered structure called the [[pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAboitiz|Aboitiz et al., 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex 6-layered structure called neocortex or ''isocortex''.  In primates, the neocortex is greatly enlarged, especially the part called the [[frontal lobes]]. In humans, this enlargement of the frontal lobes is taken to an extreme, and other parts of the cortex also become quite large and complex. The hippocampus of mammals also has a distinctive structure.
[[File:Tursiops truncatus brain size.JPG|thumb|right|300px|alt=Three wrinkly models of brains, viewed from above, displayed on a gray background with small text on it. The brain at left is small and pale pink. The middle brain is large and brownish. The brain at the right is slightly smaller than the middle one but much larger than the left one, and pink.|Scale model of [[bottlenose dolphin]] (''Tursiops truncatus'')  brain (middle), compared with brains of wild [[pig]] (''Sus scrofa'') (left), and man (''Homo sapiens'') (right)]]
Unfortunately, the evolutionary history of these mammalian features, especially the 6-layered cortex, is difficult to trace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAboitiz|Aboitiz, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is largely because of a [[missing link]] problem.  The ancestors of mammals, called [[synapsid]]s, split off from the ancestors of modern reptiles and birds about 350 million years ago.  However, the most recent branching that has left living results within the mammals was the split between [[monotreme]]s (the platypus and echidna), [[marsupial]]s (opossum, kangaroo, etc.) and [[placental]]s (most living mammals), which took place about 120 million years ago.  The brains of monotremes and marsupials are distinctive from those of placentals in some ways, but they have fully mammalian cortical and hippocampal structures.  Thus, these structures must have evolved  between 350 and 120 million years ago, a period that has left no evidence except fossils, which do not preserve tissue as soft as brain.

===Primates===
{{See also|Human brain}}

The brains of humans and other [[primate]]s contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are considerably larger in proportion to body size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay&quot; /&gt; Most of the enlargement comes from a massive expansion of the cortex, focusing especially on the parts serving [[Visual perception|vision]] and forethought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCalvin1996|Calvin, ''How Brains Think'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The visual processing network of primates is very complex, including at least 30 distinguishable areas, with a bewildering web of interconnections. Taking all of these together, visual processing makes use of more than half of the primate neocortex.&lt;ref name = Sereno1995&gt;&quot;Over half of the neocortex in non-human primates is occupied by visual areas. At least 25 visual areas beyond the primary visual cortex (V1) have been identified with a combination of microelectrode mapping, tracer injections, histological stains, and functional studies (1).&quot; see: {{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7754376 | last1 = Sereno |first1 = MI | last2 = Dale  | first2 = AM | last3 = Reppas | first3 = AM | last4 = Kwong | first4 = KK | last5 = Belliveau | first5 = JW | last6 = Brady | first6 =  TJ | last7 = Rosen | first7 = BR | last8 = Tootell |first8 = RBH | year = 1995 | title = Borders of multiple visual areas in human revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging | journal = Science | publisher = AAAS | volume = 268 | issue = 5212 | pages = 889–893 | url = http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/HumanRetin95.pdf | pmid = 7754376}} and refs contained therein&lt;/ref&gt; The other part of the brain that is greatly enlarged is the [[prefrontal cortex]], whose functions are difficult to summarize succinctly, but relate to [[foresight|planning]], [[working memory]], [[motivation]], [[attention]], and [[executive functions|executive control]].

===Invertebrates===
[[Image:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A fly resting on a reflective surface. A large, red eye faces the camera. The body appears transparent, apart from black pigment at the end of its abdomen. |''[[Drosophila]]'']]
For invertebrates (e.g., insects, molluscs, worms, etc.) the components of the brain differ so greatly from the vertebrate pattern that it is hard to make meaningful comparisons except on the basis of genetics.  Two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains: [[arthropod]]s ([[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[arachnid]]s, and others), and [[cephalopod]]s ([[octopus]]es, [[squid]]s, and similar [[mollusc]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;butler&quot;&gt;[[#refButler|Butler, 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt; The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large ''optical lobes'' behind each eye for visual processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;butler&quot;/&gt;
Cephalopods have the largest brains of any invertebrates. The brain of the octopus in particular is highly developed, comparable in complexity to the brains of some vertebrates.

There are a few invertebrates whose brains have been studied intensively.  The large sea slug ''[[Aplysia]]'' was chosen by Nobel Prize-winning neurophysiologist [[Eric Kandel]], because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system, as a model for studying the cellular basis of [[learning]] and memory, and subjected to hundreds of [[experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKandel|Kandel, ''In Search of Memory'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most thoroughly studied invertebrate brains, however, belong to the fruit fly ''Drosophila'' and the tiny roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]] (C. elegans)''.

Because of the large array of techniques available for studying their genetics, fruit flies have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFlybrain|Flybrain web site]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Remarkably, many aspects of ''Drosophila'' neurogenetics have turned out to be relevant to humans.  The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining ''Drosophila'' mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKonopka|Konopka &amp; Benzer, 1971]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A search in the  genomes of vertebrates turned up a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShin|Shin et al., 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''Drosophila'', the nematode worm ''C. elegans'' has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWormbook|WormBook web site]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, [[Sydney Brenner]] chose it as a [[Scientific modelling|model system]] for studying the way that genes control development.  One of the advantages of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped:  the nervous system of the [[hermaphrodite]] morph contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHobert|Hobert, ''WormBook'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a heroic project, Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed every section under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, in order to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWhite|White et al., 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information has been used to enable a multitude of studies that would not have been possible without it.

==Microscopic structure==
[[Image:Neuron with oligodendrocyte and myelin sheath.svg|thumb|right|250 px|alt=At the top, an irregular roundish blue object is labeled &quot;Oligodendrocyte&quot;, with a darker blue center labeled &quot;Nucleus&quot;. Below it is a long red tubular object terminating at the right in a group of branches. From the oligodendrocyte extend a series of blue wrappings around the red tube; these wrappings are labeled &quot;Myelin Sheath&quot; while the red spaces between each of them are labeled &quot;Node of Ranvier&quot;. At the bottom, an insert shows one myelin sheath enlarged and partly cut open to show how the blue sheath consists of concentric layers. In the insert, the red tubular object is labeled &quot;Axon&quot;, with thin yellow stripes running lengthwise inside the axon labeled &quot;Microfilament&quot; and a slightly thicker orange stripe labeled &quot;Microtubule&quot;.|[[Oligodendrocyte]]s are glial cells that form myelin around the axons of neurons.]]
The brain is composed of two broad classes of cells: neurons and [[glia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']] p 20&lt;/ref&gt;  These two types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although glial cells outnumber neurons roughly 4 to 1 in the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAzevedo|Azevedo ''et al.'', 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.

The property that makes neurons so important is that, unlike glia, they are capable of sending signals to each other over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], p 21&lt;/ref&gt;  They send these signals by means of an axon, a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body.  The extent of an axon can be extraordinary:  to take an example, if a [[pyramidal cell]] of the neocortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending farther than a kilometer.  These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called [[action potentials]], lasting less than a thousandth of a second and traveling along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second.  Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular temporal patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.

[[Image:Pyramidal hippocampal neuron 40x.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|alt=A triangular black cell is seen against a gray background, with long, highly branched, black processes extending out from it in multiple directions.|Neurons often have extensive networks of [[dendrites]], which receive synaptic connections. Shown here is photomicrograph of a [[pyramidal neuron]] from the human hippocampus, stained by the [[Golgi method]].]]
Axons transmit signals to other neurons, or to non-neuronal cells, by means of specialized junctions called [[synapse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections.  When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released.  The neurotransmitter binds to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] molecules in the membrane of the target cell.  Some types of neuronal receptors are ''excitatory'', meaning that they increase the rate of action potentials in the target cell; other receptors are ''inhibitory'', meaning that they decrease the rate of action potentials; others have complex modulatory effects.

Axons actually fill most of the space in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Often large groups of them are bundled together in what are called ''nerve fiber tracts''.  Many axons are wrapped in thick sheaths of a fatty substance called [[myelin]], which serves to greatly increase the speed of action potential propagation.  Myelin is white, so parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as ''white matter'', in contrast to the ''gray matter'' that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies.  The total length of myelinated axons in an average adult human brain is well over {{convert|100000|km}} .&lt;ref name=&quot;Marner&quot;&gt;[[#refMarner|Marner ''et al.'', 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{Main|Neural development}}

[[Image:EmbryonicBrain.svg|thumb|right|alt=The nervous system is shown as a rod with protrusions along its length. The spinal cord at the bottom connects to the hindbrain which widens out before narrowing again. This is connected to the midbrain, which again bulges, and which finally connects to the forebrain which has two large protrusions. |This diagram depicts the main subdivisions of the [[embryogenesis|embryonic]] vertebrate brain. These regions will later differentiate into forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain structures.]]
The brain does not simply grow; rather, it develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages.&lt;ref name=PurvesLichtmanCh1&gt;[[#refPurvesLichtman|''Principles of Neural Development'']], Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Many neurons are created in special zones that contain [[stem cells]], and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPurvesLichtman|''Principles of Neural Development'']], Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the cortex, for example, the first stage of development is the formation of a &quot;scaffold&quot; by a special group of glial cells, called [[radial glia]], which send fibers vertically across the cortex. New cortical neurons are created at the bottom of the cortex, and then &quot;climb&quot; along the radial fibers until they reach the layers they are destined to occupy in the adult.

In vertebrates, the early stages of neural development are similar for all species.&lt;ref name=PurvesLichtmanCh1/&gt;  As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of [[ectoderm]] running along the midline of the back is [[induction (biology)|induced]] to become the [[neural plate]], the precursor of the nervous system.  The neural plate invaginates to form the [[neural groove]], and then the [[neural folds|folds]] that line the groove merge to enclose the [[neural tube]], a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center.  At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the [[prosencephalon|forebrain]], [[mesencephalon|midbrain]], and [[rhombencephalon|hindbrain]].&lt;ref name=PurvesLichtmanCh1/&gt;  At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the [[telencephalon]] (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the [[diencephalon]] (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus).  At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the [[metencephalon]] (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the [[myelencephalon]] (which will contain the [[medulla oblongata]]).  Each of these areas contains proliferative zones at which neurons and glia cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.

Once a neuron is in place, it begins to extend dendrites and an axon into the area around it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPurvesLichtman|''Principles of Neural Development'']], Chs. 5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to make contact with specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a &quot;growth cone&quot;, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Taking the entire brain into account, many thousands of genes give rise to proteins that influence axonal pathfinding.

The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In many parts of the brain, axons initially &quot;overgrow&quot;, and then are &quot;pruned&quot; by mechanisms that depend on neural activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPurvesLichtman|''Principles of Neural Development'']], Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point on the surface of the [[retina]] to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at some point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer.&lt;ref name=Wong&gt;[[#refWong|Wong, 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time: that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.

Similar things happen in other brain areas: an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined  chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs.  In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely for the purpose of guiding development.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;

In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain actually contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPurvesLichtman|''Principles of Neural Development'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life.  The two areas for which this is well established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different, however; as with most types of cells in the body, these are generated throughout the lifespan.

Although the pool of neurons is largely in place by birth, the axonal connections continue to develop for a long time afterward. In humans, full myelination is not completed until adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPaus|Paus et al., 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has long been debate about whether the qualities of [[mind]], personality, and intelligence can mainly be attributed to heredity or to upbringing; the [[nature versus nurture debate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRidley|Ridley, ''Nature vs Nurture'']]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not just a philosophical question: it has great practical relevance to parents and educators. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience clearly shows that both factors are essential. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections. In some respects it is mainly a matter of presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWiesel|Wiesel, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience may be more relevant: for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|enriched environments]] have thicker cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refvanPraag|van Praag et al., 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

From an organismic perspective, the primary function of a brain is to control the actions of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCarew|Carew, ''Behavioral Neurobiology'']], Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  To do this, it extracts enough relevant information from sense organs to refine actions.  Sensory signals may stimulate an immediate response as when the olfactory system of a deer detects the odor of a wolf; they may modulate an ongoing pattern of activity as in the effect of light-dark cycles on an organism's sleep-wake behavior; or their information may be stored in case of future relevance.  The brain manages its complex task by orchestrating functional subsystems, which can be categorized in a number of ways: anatomically, chemically, and functionally.

===Functional subsystems===
The most straightforward way to categorize the parts of the brain is anatomically, but there are also several ways to subdivide it functionally. One of the most important of these is on the basis of the chemical neurotransmitters used by neurons to communicate with each other. Another is in terms of the way a brain area contributes to information processing:  sensory areas bring information into the brain and reformat it; motor signals send information out of the brain to control muscles and glands; arousal systems modulate the activity of the brain according to time of day and other factors.

====Neurotransmitter systems====
{{Main|Neurotransmitter systems}}
With few exceptions, each neuron in the brain consistently releases the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all of the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as [[Dale's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters it releases.  The two neurotransmitters that appear most frequently are [[glutamate]], which is almost always excitatory, and [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory.  Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain, making up a large percentage of the brain's pool of synapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcGeer|McGeer and McGeer, ''Basic Neurochemistry'', pp. 311–332]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering neurotransmitter systems not directly involving glutamatergic or GABAergic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCooper|Cooper et al., ''Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  Drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, Prozac, Thorazine, ''etc.'', act on other neurotransmitters.  Many of these other transmitters come from neurons that are localized in particular parts of the brain.  [[Serotonin]], for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the [[Raphe nuclei]].  [[Norepinephrine]], which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the [[locus ceruleus]].  Histamine, as a neurotransmitter, comes from a tiny part of the hypothalamus called the tuberomammilary nucleus (histamine also has non-CNS functions, but the neurotransmitter function is what causes antihistamines to have sedative effects).  Other neurotransmitters such as [[acetylcholine]] and [[dopamine]] have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.

====Sensory systems====
{{Main|Sensory system}}

One of the primary functions of a brain is to extract biologically relevant information from sensory inputs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in the human brain, sensory processes go well beyond the classical five senses of sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell:  our brains are provided with information about temperature, balance, limb position, and the chemical composition of the bloodstream, among other things.  All of these modalities are detected by specialized sensors that project signals into the brain.  In other animals, additional senses may be present, such as the infrared heat-sensors in the pit organs of snakes; or the &quot;standard&quot; senses may be used in nonstandard ways, as in the auditory &quot;sonar&quot; of bats. Here are a few principles that apply to most sensory systems, using the [[auditory system]] for specific examples.

Each sensory system begins with specialized &quot;sensory receptor&quot; cells.  These are neurons, but unlike most neurons, they are not controlled by synaptic input from other neurons:  instead they are activated by membrane-bound receptors that are sensitive to some physical modality, such as light, temperature, or physical stretching.  The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain.  For the sense of hearing, the receptors are located in the inner ear, on the cochlea, and are activated by vibration.&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Chs. 21, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

For most senses, there is a &quot;primary nucleus&quot; or set of nuclei, located in the brainstem, that gathers signals from the sensory receptor cells.  For the sense of hearing, these are the [[cochlear nuclei]].&lt;ref name=hearing /&gt;  In many cases, there are secondary subcortical areas that extract special information of some sort.  For the sense of hearing, the superior olivary area and inferior colliculus are involved in comparing the signals from the two ears to extract information about the direction of the sound source, among other functions.&lt;ref name=hearing /&gt;  Each sensory system also has a special part of the thalamus dedicated to it, which serves as a relay to the cortex.  For the sense of hearing, this is the [[medial geniculate nucleus]].&lt;ref name=hearing /&gt;

For each sensory system, there is a &quot;primary&quot; cortical area that receives direct input from the thalamic relay area.  For the auditory system this is the [[primary auditory cortex]], located in the upper part of the temporal lobe.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt;  There are also usually a set of &quot;higher level&quot; cortical sensory areas, which analyze the sensory input in specific ways.  For the auditory system, there are areas that analyze sound quality, rhythm, and temporal patterns of change, among other features.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt;  Finally, there are ''multimodal'' areas that combine inputs from different sensory modalities, for example auditory and visual.  At this point, the signals have reached parts of the brain that are best described as ''integrative'' rather than specifically ''sensory''.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt;

All of these rules have exceptions. For example, the sense of touch (which is actually a set of at least half-a-dozen distinct mechanical senses), the sensory inputs terminate mainly in the spinal cord, on neurons that then project to the brainstem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 23&lt;/ref&gt; For the sense of smell, there is no relay in the thalamus; instead the signals go directly from the primary brain area—the olfactory bulb—to the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motor systems====
{{Main|Motor system}}

Motor systems are areas of the brain that are more or less directly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles.  With the exception of the muscles that control the eye, all of the voluntary muscles&lt;ref&gt;See [[muscle]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the body are directly innervated by [[motor neuron]]s in the spinal cord, which therefore are the final common path for the movement-generating system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain.  The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many [[reflex]] responses, and also contain [[central pattern generator|pattern generators]] for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Chs. 36, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.

The brain contains a number of areas that project directly to the spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons.  At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the [[red nucleus]], which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs.  At a higher level yet is the [[primary motor cortex]], a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe.  The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, via the so-called [[pyramidal tract]].  This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other &quot;secondary&quot; motor-related brain areas do not project directly to the spinal cord, but instead act on the cortical or subcortical primary motor areas.  Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum:
*The [[premotor cortex]] (which is actually a large complex of areas) adjoins the primary motor cortex, and projects to it.  Whereas elements of the primary motor cortex map to specific body areas, elements of the premotor cortex are often involved in coordinated movements of multiple body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[basal ganglia]] are a set of structures in the base of the forebrain that project to many other motor-related areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Their function has been difficult to understand, but one of the most popular theories currently is that they play a key role in [[action selection]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGurney|Gurney et al., 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the time they restrain actions by sending constant inhibitory signals to action-generating systems, but in the right circumstances, they release this inhibition and therefore allow their targets to take control of behavior.
* The [[cerebellum]] is a very distinctive structure attached to the back of the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;refprinciples&quot;/&gt;  It does not control or originate behaviors, but instead generates corrective signals to make movements more precise.  People with cerebellar damage are not paralyzed in any way, but their body movements become erratic and uncoordinated.

In addition to all of the above, the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the [[autonomic nervous system]], which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the &quot;smooth&quot; muscles of the gut.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  The autonomic nervous system affects [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiration rate]], [[salivation]], [[perspiration]], [[urination]], and [[sexual arousal]]—but most of its functions are not under direct voluntary control.

====Arousal systems====

{{See also|Sleep}}
Perhaps the most obvious aspect of the behavior of any animal is the daily cycle between sleeping and waking.  Arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale, though, by an extensive network of brain areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles45&quot;&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component of the arousal system is the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAntle|Antle &amp; Silver, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The SCN contains the body's central biological clock.  Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, [[circadian rhythm]]s:  these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of &quot;clock genes&quot;.  The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (RHT), that allow daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.

The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles.  An important component of the system is the so-called [[reticular formation]], a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles45&quot; /&gt;  Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex.  Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.

Sleep involves great changes in brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKleitman|Kleitman, 1938]]&lt;/ref&gt; but this is now known to be far from true:  activity continues, but patterns become very different.  In fact, there are two types of sleep, ''[[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]'' (with dreaming) and ''[[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]]'' (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode.  Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured:  REM, light NREM and deep NREM.  During deep NREM sleep, also called [[slow wave sleep]], activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, where in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized.  Levels of the neurotransmitters [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]] drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of [[acetylcholine]] show the reverse pattern.

===Brain energy consumption===
[[Image:PET-image.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A flat oval object is surrounded by blue. The object is largely green-yellow, but contains a dark red patch at one end and a number of blue patches. |[[Positron emission tomography|PET]] Image of the human brain showing energy consumption]]
Although the human brain represents only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body [[glucose]] utilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClark|Clark &amp; Sokoloff, 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSafi|Safi et al., 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The brain mostly utilizes glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in [[hypoglycemia]], can result in loss of consciousness.  The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions:  this fact forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRaichle|Raichle &amp; Gusnard, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; These are nuclear medicine imaging techniques which produce a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.

==Brain and mind==
{{See also|Philosophies of mind}}
Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|Churchland, ''Neurophilosophy'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The most straightforward scientific evidence that there is a strong relationship between the physical brain [[matter]] and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[psychoactive drug]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoake|Boake and Diller, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mind-body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; which asks us to consider if the brain and the mind are identical, partially distinct, or related in some unknown way.  There are three major schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] holds that the mind exists independently of the brain;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHart|Hart, 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[materialism]] holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena;&lt;ref name=&quot;DicPhil&quot;&gt;[[#refLacey|Lacey, 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]] holds that only mental phenomena exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;DicPhil&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a high number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence [[cognition]], and the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].

Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers such as [[Patricia Churchland]] posit that the drug-mind interaction is indicative of an intimate connection between the brain and the mind, not that the two are the same entity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in [[The Description of the Human Body|mechanistic terms]], although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDescartes|Descartes, ''Description of the human body'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The field of [[neuroscience]] encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrinciples|''Principles of Neural Science'']], Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychology]] seeks to understand mind and behavior, and [[neurology]] is the [[medicine|medical]] discipline that diagnoses and treats pathologies of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in [[psychiatry]], the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat [[mental disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStorrow|Storrow, ''Outline of Clinical Psychiatry'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cognitive science]] seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as [[computer science]] ([[artificial intelligence]] and similar fields) and [[philosophy]].

The oldest method of studying the brain is [[Neuroanatomy|anatomical]], and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better stains and better microscopes—the neuroanatomist [[Floyd Bloom]] famously quipped that &quot;the gain in brain is mainly in the stain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBearConnorsParadiso|''Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain'', Ch. 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses.  Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.  In recent years, the development of [[immunostaining]] techniques has allowed staining of neurons that express specific sets of genes.  Also, ''functional neuroanatomy'' uses [[medical imaging]] techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.

Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain:  their primary tools are drugs and recording devices.  Many thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways.  Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the skull as in [[electroencephalography|EEG]] studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for [[extracellular]] recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDowling|Dowling, ''Neurons and Networks'']], pages 15–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress.  The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable [[epilepsy]], in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes in order to localize the brain area responsible for [[seizure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWyllie|Wyllie et al., ''Treatment of Epilepsy'']], Ch. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to study brain activity noninvasively in humans using [[functional imaging]] techniques such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]—this field has expanded enormously over the past two decades.

A different approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of [[Brain damage|damage]] to specific brain areas.  Even though it is protected by the skull and [[meninges]], surrounded by [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and isolated from the bloodstream by the [[blood-brain barrier]], the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKolbWhishaw|Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, Ch. 1]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.

[[Computational neuroscience]] encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain; second, the study of how brains perform computation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott&quot;&gt;[[#refAbbott|Abbott &amp; Dayan, ''Theoretical Neuroscience'']]&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are known as ''biologically realistic neural networks''. On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically analyzing, the operations of simplified &quot;units&quot; that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity.  The computational functions of the brain are studied both by neuroscientists and computer scientists.

Recent years have seen the first applications of genetic engineering techniques to the study of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTonegawa|Tonegawa et al., 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common subjects are mice, because the technical tools are more advanced for this species than for any other.  It is now possible with relative ease to &quot;knock out&quot; or mutate a wide variety of genes, and then examine the effects on brain function.  More sophisticated approaches are also beginning to be used:  for example, using the [[Cre-Lox recombination]] method it is possible to activate or inactivate genes in specific parts of the brain, at specific times.

==History==

{{See also|History of neuroscience}}
Early views were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart. On one hand, it was impossible to miss the fact that awareness feels like it is localized in the head, and that blows to the head can cause unconsciousness much more easily than blows to the chest, and that shaking the head causes dizziness. On the other hand, the brain to a superficial examination seems inert, whereas the heart is constantly beating. Cessation of the heartbeat means death; strong emotions produce changes in the heartbeat; and emotional distress often produces a sensation of pain in the region of the heart (&quot;heartache&quot;). Aristotle favored the heart, and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood. Democritus, the inventor of the atomic theory of matter, favored a three-part soul, with intellect in the head, emotion in the heart, and lust in the vicinity of the liver.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFinger|Finger, ''Origins of Neuroscience'']], p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates, the &quot;father of medicine&quot;, was entirely in favor of the brain. In ''On the Sacred Disease'', his account of epilepsy, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations. ... And by the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors assail us, some by night, and some by day, and dreams and untimely wanderings, and cares that are not suitable, and ignorance of present circumstances, desuetude, and unskilfulness. All these things we endure from the brain, when it is not healthy...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—[[Hippocrates]], ''On the Sacred Disease''&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHippocrates|Hippocrates, ''On the Sacred Disease'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The famous Roman physician [[Galen]] also advocated the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work. Even after physicians and philosophers had accepted the primacy of the brain, though, the idea of the heart as seat of intelligence continued to survive in popular idioms, such as &quot;learning something by heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHendrickson|''Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Galen did a masterful job of tracing out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain via a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically, by carrying a mysterious substance he called ''pneumata psychikon'', usually translated as &quot;animal spirits&quot;. His ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of Descartes and his followers. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions—language in particular—are carried out by a non-physical ''res cogitans'', but that the majority of behaviors of humans and animals could be explained mechanically. The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of [[Luigi Galvani]], who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract.

[[Image:PurkinjeCell.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A drawing on yellowing paper with an archiving stamp in the corner. A spidery tree branch structure connects to the top of a mass. A few narrow processes follow away from the bottom of the mass. |Drawing by Santiago Ramon y Cajal of two types of Golgi-stained neurons from the cerebellum of a pigeon]]
Each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new method of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new [[staining|stains]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBloom|Bloom, 1972]], p 211&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly critical was the invention of the [[Golgi stain]], which (when correctly used) stains only a small, and apparently random, fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of [[Camillo Golgi]], and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]], the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.

In the 20th century, progress in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells, culminating in the work by [[Alan Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley]], and others on the biophysics of the action potential, and the work of [[Bernard Katz]] and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPiccolino|Piccolino, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest studies used special preparations, such as the &quot;fast escape response&quot; system of the squid, which involves a [[Squid giant axon|giant axon]] as thick as a pencil lead, and [[Squid giant synapse|giant synapses]] connecting to this axon. Steady improvements in electrodes and electronics allowed ever finer levels of resolution. These studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity. Reflecting the new understanding, in 1942 [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Charles Sherrington]] visualized the workings of the brain in action in somewhat breathless terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither. ... It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass becomes an [[enchanted loom]] where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Sherrington, 1942, ''Man on his Nature''&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSherrington|Sherrington, ''Man on his Nature'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1990s were known in the US as the &quot;[[Decade of the Brain]]&quot; to commemorate advances made in brain research, and to promote funding for such research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/loc/brain/proclaim.html|title= Project on the Decade of the Brain|accessdate=2009-09-30|last=Bush|first=George H.W.|year=1990|month= July}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/284/5415/739|first1=Edward G.|last1=Jones|authorlink1=Edward G.

:''For the city in the late Roman and the Eastern Roman or Byzantine periods (330–1453), see [[Constantinople]]. For the Ottoman and modern city (after 1453), see [[Istanbul]]. For the empire, see [[Byzantine Empire]].''
[[File:Locator map Byzantion.PNG|thumb]]

'''Byzantium''' ({{lang-el|Βυζάντιον}}, ''Byzántion'';  [[Latin]]: {{lang|la|&lt;small&gt;BYZANTIVM&lt;/small&gt;}}) was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city, founded by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists from [[Megara]] in [[667 BC]] and named after their king [[Byzas]] (Greek: Βύζας, ''Býzas'', [[genitive case|genitive]] Βύζαντος, ''Býzantos''). The name ''Byzantium'' is a [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinization]] of the original name '''Byzantion'''. The city was later renamed [[Constantinople]] and briefly became the imperial residence of the classical [[Roman Empire]], and then subsequently was, for more than a thousand years, the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]-speaking Roman Empire of [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. Constantinople was captured by the [[Ottoman Turks]], becoming the capital of their empire, in 1453. The name of the city was officially changed to [[Istanbul]] in 1930 following the establishment of modern [[Turkey]].

==History==
[[File:Coinage with Byzas 2nd 3rd century CE.jpg|thumb|Coinage with idealized depiction of [[Byzas]], founder of Byzantium. Cast in [[Thrace]], Byzantium, around the time of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-180 CE).]]
The origins of Byzantium are shrouded in legend. The traditional legend has it that  [[Byzas]]  from [[Megara]] (a town near [[Athens]]), founded Byzantium in 667 BCE, when he sailed northeast across the [[Aegean Sea]]. Byzas had consulted the [[Oracle at Delphi]] to ask where to make his new city. The Oracle told him to find it &quot;opposite the blind.&quot; At the time, he did not know what this meant. But when he came upon the [[Bosporus]] he understood: on the opposite eastern shore was a Greek city, [[Chalcedon]], whose founders were said to have overlooked the superior location only {{convert|3|km|mi}} away. Byzas founded his city here on the European coast and named it Byzantion after himself. It was mainly a trading city due to its location at the [[Black Sea]]'s only entrance. Byzantion later conquered Chalcedon, across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side.

After siding with [[Pescennius Niger]] against the victorious [[Septimius Severus]], the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=k1thG1smoSMC&amp;pg=PA8 ''Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Istanbul'' Robert Bator, Chris Rothero p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus, now emperor, and quickly regained its previous prosperity. It was bound to [[Perinthos]] during the period of Septimius Severus. The location of Byzantium attracted [[Constantine I (emperor)|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] who, in 330 CE, refounded it as an imperial residence inspired by Rome itself. (See [[New Rome|Nova Roma]].)  After his death the city was called [[Constantinople]] (Greek Κωνσταντινούπολις or Konstantinoupolis) ('city of Constantine'). It remained the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which is called the [[Byzantine Empire]] by modern historians.
This combination of imperialism and location would affect Constantinople's role as the nexus point between two continents: [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. It was a commercial, cultural, and diplomatic magnet.  With its strategic position, Constantinople controlled the route between Asia and Europe, as well as the passage from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. On May 29, 1453, the city fell to the [[Ottoman Turks]], and again became the capital of a powerful state, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Turks called the city [[Istanbul]] (though not officially renamed until 1930) and it has remained Turkey's largest and most populous city, although [[Ankara]] is now the capital.

Though associated with the Sassanid Persians and with [[Mithradates VI Eupator]] (who for a time incorporated the city into his empire),&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Traver, ''From Polis to Empire, The Ancient World, [[circa|ca.]] 800 B.C.E.-C.E. 500'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p257&lt;/ref&gt; by the late [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or early Roman period, the star and crescent motif had been associated to some degree with Byzantium. For example, some Byzantine coins of the 1st century BCE and later show the head of [[Artemis]] with bow and quiver, and feature a crescent with what appears to be a six-rayed star on the reverse. According to accounts which vary in some of the details, in 340 BCE the Byzantines and their allies the [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] were under siege by the troops of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]]. On a particularly dark and wet night Philip attempted a surprise attack but was thwarted by the appearance of a bright light in the sky. This light is occasionally described by subsequent interpreters as a meteor, sometimes as the moon, and some accounts also mention the barking of dogs. However, the original accounts mention only a light in the sky, without specifying the moon.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 340 BCE, however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age, Philip of Macedon. In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger. To commemorate this timely phenomenon, which was attributed to Hecate, they erected a public statue to that goddess [...]&quot; William Gordon Holmes, ''The Age of Justinian and Theodora'', 2003 p5-6; &quot;If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was Hecate. Hecate had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of &quot;liminal places,&quot; in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate's importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to he legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions. Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history. A statue known as the 'Lampadephoros' was erected on the hill above the Bosphorous to commemorate Hecate's defensive aid.&quot; Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p126-127&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate the event the Byzantines erected a statue of [[Hecate]] ''lampadephoros'' (light-bearer or bringer). This story survived in the works of [[Hesychius of Miletus]], who in all probability lived in the time of [[Justinian I]]. His works survive only in fragments preserved in [[Photius]] and the tenth century lexicographer [[Suda|Suidas]]. The tale is also related by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], and [[Eustathius]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Devotion to Hecate was especially favored by the Byzantines for her aid in having protected them from the incursions of Philip of Macedon. Her symbols were the crescent and star, and the walls of her city were her provenance.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is unclear how the symbol of a particular goddess (one of many)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 324 Byzantium had a number of operative cults to traditional gods and goddesses tied to its very foundation eight hundred years before. Rhea, called &quot;the mother of the gods&quot; by Zosimus, had a well-ensconced cult in Byzantium from its very foundation. [...] Devotion to Hecate was especially favored by the Byzantines [...] Constantine would also have found Artemis-Selene and Aphrodite along with the banished Apollo Zeuxippus on the Acropolis in the old Greek section of the city. Other gods mentioned in the sources are Athena, Hera, Zeus, Hermes, and Demeter and Kore. Even evidence of Isis and Serapis appears from the Roman era on coins during the reign of Caracalla and from inscriptions.&quot; Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p16&lt;/ref&gt; would have been transferred to the city itself. If the Byzantines adopted the crescent and star as a symbol of their city after the events of the mid 4th century BC, one is forced to wonder why they waited several hundred years before putting the symbol on only some of their coins. 

Later, under the Romans, cities in the empire often continued to issue their own coinage. &quot;Of the many themes that were used on local coinage, celestial and astral symbols often appeared, mostly stars or crescent moons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Molnar, ''The Star of Bethlehem'', Rutgers University Press, 1999, p48&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variety of these issues, and the varying explanations for the significance of the star and crescent on Roman coinage precludes their discussion here. It is, however, apparent that by the time of the Romans, coins featuring a star or crescent in some combination were not at all rare.

The '''Berlin Wall''' ({{lang-de|Berliner Mauer}}) was a barrier constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, [[East Germany]]) starting on 13 August 1961, that completely cut off [[West Berlin]] from surrounding East Germany and from [[East Berlin]]. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls,&lt;ref name=&quot;Marck&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_70.shtml Jack Marck] &quot;Over the Wall: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience&quot; ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the &quot;death strip&quot;) that contained anti-vehicle trenches, &quot;[[bed of nails|fakir beds]]&quot; and other defenses. The Soviet-dominated [[Eastern Bloc]] officially claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from [[Fascism|fascist]] elements conspiring to prevent the &quot;will of the people&quot; in building a [[Communism|socialist state]] in East Germany. However, in practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|emigration and defection]] that marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.

The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the &quot;[[Anti-Fascist]] Protection Rampart&quot; ({{lang-de|Antifaschistischer Schutzwall}}) by GDR authorities, implying that neighbouring [[West Germany]] had not been fully [[De-Nazification|de-Nazified]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.univie.ac.at/ernst.grabovszki/Handout_Eingemauert.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the &quot;[[Wall of Shame]]&quot;—a term coined by mayor [[Willy Brandt]]—while condemning the Wall's restriction on [[freedom of movement]]. Along with the separate and much longer [[Inner German border]] (IGB) that demarcated the border between East and [[West Germany]], both borders came to symbolize the &quot;[[Iron Curtain]]&quot; between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]].

Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions]] and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin, from where they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the wall prevented almost all such emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monday, Nov. 20, 1989 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959058,00.html |title=Freedom! - TIME |publisher=TIME&lt;! |date=1989-11-20 |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with estimates of the resulting death toll varying between 100 and 200.

In 1989, [[Revolutions of 1989|a radical series of political changes]] occurred in the [[Eastern Bloc]], associated with the [[glasnost|liberalization]] of the Eastern Bloc's authoritarian systems and the erosion of political power in the pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] governments in nearby [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]]. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, a euphoric public and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of the rest. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for [[German reunification]], which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.

==Background==
===Post-war Germany===
After the [[end of World War II in Europe]], what remained of pre-war Germany west of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] was divided into four occupation zones (per the [[Potsdam Agreement]]), each one controlled by one of the four occupying [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]: the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The capital of Berlin, as the seat of the [[Allied Control Council]], was similarly subdivided into four sectors despite the city's location deep inside the Soviet zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two years, political divisions increased between the Soviets and the other occupying powers. These included the Soviets' refusal to agree to reconstruction plans making post-war Germany self-sufficient and to a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain, France, the United States and the [[Benelux]] countries later met to combine the non-Soviet zones of the country into one zone for reconstruction and approve the extension of the [[Marshall Plan]].

===The Eastern Bloc and the Berlin airlift===
{{See|Eastern Bloc|Berlin Blockade}}
Following World War II, Soviet leader [[Josef Stalin]] built up a protective belt of Soviet-controlled nations on his Western border, the [[Eastern bloc]], that then included Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which he wished to maintain alongside a weakened Soviet-controlled Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1945, Stalin revealed to German communist leaders that he expected to slowly undermine the British position within the British occupation zone, that the United States would withdraw within a year or two, and that nothing then would stand in the way of a united Germany under communist control within the Soviet orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major task of the ruling communist party in the Soviet zone was to channel Soviet orders down to both the administrative apparatus and the other bloc parties, while pretending that these were initiatives of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig94&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=95-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property and industry was nationalized in the East German zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig96&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The political process contrasted with that in western German zones occupied by Britain, France and the United States, where minister-presidents were chosen by freely elected parliamentary assemblies. (Turner, Henry Ashby. ''The Two Germanies Since 1945: East and West'', Yale University Press, 1987, ISBN 0-300-03865-8, page 20)&lt;/ref&gt; If statements or decisions deviated from the described line, reprimands and, for persons outside public attention, punishment would ensue, such as imprisonment, torture and even death.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig94&quot;/&gt;

Indoctrination of [[Marxism-Leninism]] became a compulsory part of school curricula, sending professors and students fleeing to the west. The East Germans created an elaborate political police apparatus that kept the population under close surveillance,&lt;ref name=&quot;turner47&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Soviet [[SMERSH]] secret police.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig96&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, following disagreements regarding reconstruction and a new German currency, Stalin instituted the [[Berlin Blockade]], preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began a massive &quot;[[Berlin airlift]]&quot;, supplying West Berlin with food and other supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=65–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the western policy change. Communists attempted to disrupt the elections of 1948, preceding large losses therein,&lt;ref name=&quot;turner29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 300,000 Berliners demonstrated for the international airlift to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch-Bournazel, Renata, ''Confronting the German Question: Germans on the East-West Divide'', Berg Publishers, 1990, ISBN 0-85496-684-6, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1949, Stalin lifted the blockade, permitting the resumption of Western shipments to Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis 2005, p. 34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]] was declared on 7 October 1949. By a secret treaty, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs accorded the East German state administrative authority, but not autonomy. The Soviets had unlimited power over the occupation regime and penetrated East German administrative, military and secret police structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig179&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a congratulatory telegram, Stalin emphasized that, with the creation of East Germany, the &quot;enslavement of European countries by the global imperialists was rendered impossible.&quot; (Wettig, Gerhard, ''Stalin and the Cold War in Europe'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008, ISBN 0-7425-5542-9, page 179)&lt;/ref&gt;

East Germany differed from West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]), which developed into a [[Western civilization|Western]] capitalist country with a [[social market economy]] (''{{lang|de|&quot;Soziale Marktwirtschaft&quot;}}'' in German) and a [[democracy|democratic]] parliamentary government. Continual economic growth starting in the 1950s fuelled a 20-year &quot;[[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]]&quot; (''{{lang|de|&quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;}}''). As West Germany's economy grew and its standard of living continually improved, many East Germans wanted to move to West Germany.

===Emigration westward in the early 1950s===
{{Main|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc}}
After Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas of the [[Eastern Bloc]] aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;thackeray188&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Thackeray|2004|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of the zonal border between occupied zones in Germany, the number of GDR citizens moving to West Germany totaled 187,000 in 1950; 165,000 in 1951; 182,000 in 1952; and 331,000 in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[http://www.stmas.bayern.de/migration/aussiedler/aussstat.pdf Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Arbeit und Sozialordnung, Familie und Frauen, ''Statistik Spätaussiedler Dezember 2007'']}}, p.3 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;loescher60&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Loescher|2001|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the sharp 1953 increase was fear of potential further [[Sovietization]], given the increasingly paranoid actions of [[Joseph Stalin]] in late 1952 and early 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;loescher68&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Loescher|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; 226,000 had fled in just the first six months of 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;dale17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dale|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erection of the inner German border==
{{See|Inner German border|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection}}
By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement, restricting [[emigration]], was emulated by most of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]], including East Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions presented a quandary for some Eastern Bloc states that had been more economically advanced and open than the Soviet Union, such that crossing borders seemed more natural—especially where no prior border existed between East and West Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 1952, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty121&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] proposed that the East Germans should &quot;introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents&quot; in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation &quot;intolerable&quot;. He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that &quot;The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border—and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison240&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=240-fn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the [[inner German border]] between the two German states was closed, and a barbed-wire fence erected. The border between the Western and Eastern sectors of Berlin, however, remained open, although traffic between the Soviet and the Western sectors was somewhat restricted. This resulted in Berlin becoming a magnet for East Germans desperate to escape life in the GDR, and also a flashpoint for tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.

In 1955, the Soviets gave East Germany authority over civilian movement in Berlin, passing control to a regime not recognized in the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, East Germany granted &quot;visits&quot; to allow its residents access to West Germany. However, following the defection of large numbers of East Germans under this regime, the new East German state legally restricted virtually all travel to the West in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty121&quot;/&gt; Soviet East German ambassador [[Mikhail Pervukhin]] observed that &quot;the presence in Berlin of an open and essentially uncontrolled border between the socialist and capitalist worlds unwittingly prompts the population to make a comparison between both parts of the city, which unfortunately, does not always turn out in favor of the Democratic [East] Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison99&quot;/&gt;

===The Berlin emigration loophole===
{{See|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection}}
With the closing of the [[inner German border]] officially in 1952,&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison99&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; the border in Berlin remained considerably more accessible then because it was administered by all four occupying powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty121&quot;/&gt; Accordingly, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Maddrell, ''Spying on Science: Western Intelligence in Divided Germany 1945–1961'', p. 56. [[Oxford University Press]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 1957, East Germany introduced a new passport law that reduced the overall number of refugees leaving Eastern Germany.

It had the unintended result of drastically increasing the percentage of those leaving through West Berlin from 60% to well over 90% by the end of 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison99&quot;/&gt; Those caught trying to leave East Berlin were subjected to heavy penalties, but with no physical barrier and [[Berlin U-Bahn|subway]] train access still available to West Berlin, such measures were ineffective.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty122&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin sector border was essentially a &quot;[[loophole]]&quot; through which Eastern Bloc citizens could still escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison99&quot;/&gt; The 3.5 million East Germans who had left by 1961 totalled approximately 20% of the entire East German population.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty122&quot;/&gt;

===Brain drain===
{{See|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection}}
The emigrants tended to be young and well-educated, leading to the &quot;brain drain&quot; feared by officials in East Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;thackeray188&quot;/&gt; [[Yuri Andropov]], then the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Director on Relations with Communist and Workers Parties of Socialist Countries, wrote an urgent letter on 28 August 1958, to the Central Committee about the significant 50% increase in the number of East German intelligentsia among the refugees.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andropov reported that, while the East German leadership stated that they were leaving for economic reasons, testimony from refugees indicated that the reasons were more political than material.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison100&quot;/&gt; He stated &quot;the flight of the intelligentsia has reached a particularly critical phase.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison100&quot;/&gt;

By 1960, the combination of World War II and the massive emigration westward left East Germany with only 61% of its population of working age, compared to 70.5% before the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty122&quot;/&gt; The loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals: engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers and skilled workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty122&quot;/&gt; The direct cost of manpower losses has been estimated at $7 billion to $9 billion, with East German party leader [[Walter Ulbricht]] later claiming that West Germany owed him $17 billion in compensation, including reparations as well as manpower losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowty122&quot;/&gt; In addition, the drain of East Germany's young population potentially cost it over 22.5 billion marks in lost educational investment.&lt;ref&gt;Volker Rolf Berghahn, ''Modern Germany: Society, Economy and Politics in the Twentieth Century'', p. 227. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany that the re-securing of the German communist frontier was imperative.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson75&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction begins, 1961==
[[Image:Berlin Wall 1961-11-20.jpg|thumb|East German construction workers building the Berlin Wall, 20 November 1961.]]

On 15 June 1961, First Secretary of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] and [[Staatsrat|GDR State Council]] chairman [[Walter Ulbricht]] stated in an international press conference, ''{{lang|de|&quot;Niemand hat die Absicht, eine Mauer zu errichten!&quot;}}'' (No one has the intention of erecting a wall!). It was the first time the colloquial term ''{{lang|de|Mauer}}'' (wall) had been used in this context.

The record of a telephone call between [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and Ulbricht on 1 August in the same year, suggests that it was Khrushchev from whom the initiative for the construction of the wall came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/4246/_wir_lassen_euch_jetzt_ein_zwei_wochen_zeit.html Wiegrefe, Klaus. &quot;Wir lassen euch jetzt ein, zwei Wochen Zeit&quot;], {{lang|de|''Spiegel Online – einestages''}}, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welt.de/politik/article3828831/Das-Gespraech-zwischen-Ulbricht-und-Chruschtschow.html Record of the conversation]&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday, 12 August 1961, the leaders of the GDR attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in {{lang|de|Döllnsee}}, in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin. There {{lang|de|Ulbricht}} signed the order to close the border and erect a wall.

At midnight, the police and units of the East German army began to close the border and, by Sunday morning, 13 August, the border with West Berlin was closed. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the border to make them impassable to most vehicles and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the 156&amp;nbsp;kilometres (97 miles) around the three western sectors, and the 43&amp;nbsp;kilometres (27 miles) that divided West and East Berlin.

The barrier was built slightly inside East Berlin or East German territory to ensure that it did not encroach on West Berlin at any point. Later, it was built up into the Wall proper, the first concrete elements and large blocks being put in place on 17 August. During the construction of the Wall, [[National People's Army]] (NVA) and [[Combat Groups of the Working Class]] (KdA) soldiers stood in front of it with orders to shoot anyone who attempted to defect. Additionally, chain fences, walls, minefields and other obstacles were installed along the length of East Germany's western border with West Germany proper. A huge no man's land was cleared to provide a clear line of fire at fleeing refugees.[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1961/Wall-Goes-Up-in-Berlin/12295509433760-7/]

===Immediate effects===
With the closing of the East-West sector boundary in Berlin, the vast majority of East Germans could no longer travel or emigrate to West Germany. Many families were split, while East Berliners employed in the West were cut off from their jobs. West Berlin became an isolated enclave in a hostile land. West Berliners demonstrated against the wall, led by their Mayor ({{lang|de|[[Oberbürgermeister]]}}) Willy Brandt, who strongly criticized the United States for failing to respond. Allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees, but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city. In 1961, Secretary of State Dean Rusk proclaimed, &quot;The Wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the European landscape. I see no reason why the Soviet Union should think it is—it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to Communist failure.&quot;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1961/Wall-Goes-Up-in-Berlin/12295509433760-7/]
 
[[Image:Kennedy in Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] visiting the Berlin Wall on 26 June 1963.]]

In a speech on 26 July 1963, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] had acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;[http://uspoliticsguide.com/US-Politics-Directory/US-Politcal-Historical-Speeches/JFK-Berlin-Wall.htm US Politics Guide] – speech transcript&lt;/ref&gt; that the United States could only hope to defend West Berliners and West Germans; to attempt to stand up for East Germans would result only in an embarrassing downfall. Accordingly, the administration made polite protests at length via the usual channels, but without fervour. The Wall violated postwar Potsdam Agreements, which gave the United Kingdom, France and the United States a say over the administration of the whole of Berlin. A few months after the barbed wire was erected, the U.S. government informed the Soviet government that it accepted the Wall as &quot;a fact of international life&quot; and would not challenge it by force.

US and UK sources had expected the Soviet sector to be sealed off from West Berlin, but were surprised by how long the East Germans took for such a move. They considered the wall as an end to concerns about a GDR/Soviet retaking or capture of the whole of Berlin; the wall would presumably have been an unnecessary project if such plans were afloat. Thus they concluded that the possibility of a Soviet military conflict over Berlin decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Frederick. ''The Berlin Wall: 13 August 1961 – 9 November 1989''. Bloomsbury 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The East German government claimed that the Wall was an &quot;anti-fascist protective rampart&quot; ({{lang-de|&quot;antifaschistischer Schutzwall&quot;}}) intended to dissuade aggression from the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080409133940/http://www.goethe.de/ges/ztg/thm/ddg/en1748571.htm Goethe-Institut – Topics – German-German History Goethe-Institut]&lt;/ref&gt; Another official justification was the activities of western agents in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|&quot;Die Regierungen der Warschauer Vertragsstaaten wenden sich an die Volkskammer und an die Regierung der DDR mit dem Vorschlag, an der Westberliner Grenze eine solche Ordnung einzuführen, durch die der Wühltätigkeit gegen die Länder des sozialistischen Lagers zuverlässig der Weg verlegt und ringsum das ganze Gebiet West-Berlins eine verlässliche Bewachung gewährleistet wird.&quot;}}'' {{lang|de|[http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article252861/Berlin_wird_geteilt.html Die Welt: Berlin wird geteilt]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern German government also claimed that West Berliners were buying out state-subsidized goods in East Berlin. East Germans and others greeted such statements with skepticism, as most of the time, the border was only closed for citizens of East Germany traveling to the West, but not for residents of West Berlin travelling to the East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zlb.de/projekte/millennium/original_html/nd_1961_1408.GIF.html {{de icon}} Neues Deutschland: Normales Leben in Berlin,14  August 1961]&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Wall had caused considerable hardship to families divided by it. Most people believed that the Wall was mainly a means of preventing the citizens of East Germany from entering or fleeing to West Berlin.

An East German [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] propaganda booklet published in 1955 dramatically described the serious nature of [[Republikflucht|'flight from the republic']]:

{{quotation|Both from the moral standpoint as well as in terms of the interests of the whole German nation, leaving the GDR is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity.
Those who let themselves be recruited objectively serve West German Reaction and militarism, whether they know it or not.

Is it not an act of political depravity when citizens, whether young people, workers, or members of the intelligentsia, leave and betray what our people have created through common labour in our republic to offer themselves to the American or British secret services or work for the West German factory owners, [[Junker]]s, or militarists? Does not leaving the land of progress for the morass of an historically outdated social order demonstrate political backwardness and blindness? ...

Kennedy appointed retired General [[Lucius D. Clay]], who had been the Military Governor of the US Zone of Occupation in Germany during the period of the Berlin Blockade and had ordered the first measures in what became the Berlin Airlift, as his special advisor, sending him to Berlin with ambassadorial rank. Clay was immensely popular with the residents of West Berlin, and his appointment was an unambiguous sign that Kennedy would not compromise on the status of West Berlin. Clay and Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] arrived at [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] on the afternoon of Saturday, 19 August 1961.

They arrived in a city defended by three [[Berlin Brigade|Allied brigades]]—one each from the UK, the US, and France (the [[Forces Françaises à Berlin]]). On 16 August, Kennedy had given the order for them to be reinforced. Early on 19 August, the 1st Battle Group, 18th. Infantry (commanded by Col. Glover S. Johns Jr.) was alerted.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hackworth]], About Face&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday morning, U.S. troops marched from West Germany through East Germany, bound for West Berlin. Lead elements—arranged in a column of 491 vehicles and trailers carrying 1,500 men, divided into five march units—left the Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint at 06:34. At [[Marienborn]], the Soviet checkpoint next to [[Helmstedt]] on the West German/East German border, U.S. personnel were counted by guards. The column was 160&amp;nbsp;kilometres (100&amp;nbsp;mi) long, and covered 177&amp;nbsp;kilometres (110&amp;nbsp;mi) from Marienborn to Berlin in full battle gear. East German police watched from beside trees next to the [[autobahn]] all the way along.

The front of the convoy arrived at the outskirts of Berlin just before noon, to be met by Clay and Johnson, before parading through the streets of Berlin to an adoring crowd. At 04:00 on 21 August, Lyndon Johnson left a visibly reassured West Berlin in the hands of Gen. Frederick O. Hartel and his brigade of 4,224 officers and men. Every three months for the next three and a half years, a new American battalion was rotated into West Berlin; each traveled by autobahn to demonstrate Allied rights.

The creation of the Wall had important implications for both German states. By stemming the exodus of people from East Germany, the East German government was able to reassert its control over the country: in spite of discontent with the wall, economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated. The economy in the GDR began to grow. But, the Wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole. Western powers used it in propaganda as a symbol of communist tyranny, particularly after East German border guards shot and killed would-be defectors. Such fatalities were later treated as acts of [[murder]] by the reunified Germany.

===Layout and modifications===
[[Image:Karte berliner mauer en.jpg|thumb|Position and course of the Berlin Wall and its border control checkpoints (1989)]]

The Berlin Wall was more than {{Convert|140|km|mi}} long. In June 1962, a second, parallel fence some {{Convert|100|m|yd}} farther into East German territory was built. The houses contained between the fences were razed and the inhabitants relocated, thus establishing what later became known as the ''Death Strip''. The Death Strip was covered with raked sand or gravel, rendering footprints easy to notice, easing the detection of trespassers and also enabling officers to see which guards had neglected their task;&lt;ref name=&quot;ineuropa&quot; /&gt; it offered no cover; and most importantly, it offered clear fields of fire for the wall guards.
Through the years, the Berlin Wall evolved through four versions:

# Wire fence (1961)
# Improved wire fence (1962–1965)
# Concrete wall (1965–1975)
# ''{{lang|de|Grenzmauer 75}}'' (Border Wall 75) (1975–1989)

The &quot;fourth-generation wall&quot;, known officially as &quot;{{lang|de|Stützwandelement UL 12.11}}&quot; (retaining wall element UL 12.11), was the final and most sophisticated version of the Wall.

It was reinforced by mesh [[fence|fencing]], signal fencing, anti-vehicle trenches, [[barbed wire]], dogs on long lines, &quot;[[bed of nails|beds of nails]]&quot; under balconies hanging over the &quot;death strip&quot;, over 116 [[watchtower (fortification)|watchtowers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Popiolek |url=http://www.die-berliner-mauer.de/en/fakten.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012011801/http://die-berliner-mauer.de/en/fakten.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 |title=The Berlin wall : History of Berlin Wall : Facts |publisher=Die-berliner-mauer.de |date= |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 20 [[bunker]]s.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Besides the sector-sector boundary within Berlin itself, the wall also separated West Berlin from the present-day state of [[Brandenburg]]. The following present-day municipalities, listed in counter-clockwise direction, share a border with former West Berlin:
* '''[[Oberhavel]] :''' [[Mühlenbecker Land]] &lt;small&gt;(partially)&lt;/small&gt;, [[Glienicke/Nordbahn]], [[Hohen Neuendorf]], [[Hennigsdorf]]
* '''[[Havelland]] :''' [[Schönwalde-Glien]], [[Falkensee]], [[Dallgow-Döberitz]]
* '''[[Potsdam]]''' (Urban district)
* '''[[Potsdam-Mittelmark]] :''' [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]], [[Teltow]]
* '''[[Teltow-Fläming]] :''' [[Großbeeren]], [[Blankenfelde-Mahlow]]
* '''[[Dahme-Spreewald]] :''' [[Schönefeld]] &lt;small&gt;(partially)&lt;/small&gt;

==Official crossings and usage==
{{See also|Berlin border crossings}}

There were nine border crossings between East and West Berlin, which allowed visits by West Berliners, West Germans, Western foreigners and Allied personnel into East Berlin, as well as visits by GDR citizens and citizens of other socialist countries into West Berlin, provided that they held the necessary permits. Those crossings were restricted according to which nationality was allowed to use it (East Germans, West Germans, West Berliners, other countries). The most famous was the vehicle and pedestrian checkpoint at the corner of [[Friedrichstraße]] and Zimmerstraße, also known as [[Checkpoint Charlie]], which was restricted to Allied personnel and foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison206&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|pp=206–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other border crossings existed between West Berlin and surrounding East Germany. These could be used for transit between West Germany and West Berlin, for visits by West Berliners into East Germany, for transit into countries neighbouring East Germany ([[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]]), and for visits by East Germans into West Berlin carrying a permit. After the 1972 agreements, new crossings were opened to allow West Berlin waste to be transported into East German dumps, as well as some crossings for access to West Berlin's [[exclave]]s (see ''[[Steinstücken]]'').

[[Image:Berlin - You are leaving.jpg|thumb|The famous ''You Are Leaving'' sign at a border of the American sector.]]

Four [[autobahn]]s connected West Berlin to West Germany, the most famous being the [[Bundesautobahn 2|Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn]], which entered East German territory between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn (Checkpoint Alpha), and which entered West Berlin at Dreilinden (Checkpoint Bravo for the Allied forces) in southwestern Berlin. Access to West Berlin was also possible by railway (four routes) and by boat for commercial shipping via canals and rivers.

Non-German Westerners could cross the border at [[Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station|Friedrichstraße station]] in East Berlin and at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. When the Wall was erected, Berlin's complex public transit networks, the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] and [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]], were divided with it.&lt;ref name = &quot;cgqmzv&quot;/&gt; Some lines were cut in half; many stations were shut down. Three western lines traveled through brief sections of East Berlin territory, passing through eastern stations (called ''{{lang|de|Geisterbahnhöfe}},'' or [[ghost station]]s) without stopping. Both the eastern and western networks converged at {{lang|de|Friedrichstraße}}, which became a major crossing point for those (mostly Westerners) with permission to cross.

===Who could cross===
West Germans and citizens of other Western countries could in general visit East Germany. Usually this involved application of a visa at an East German embassy several weeks in advance. Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this.

West Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all. All crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year (''{{lang|de|Passierscheinregelung}}''). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.

In 1971, with the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]], agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.

East Berliners and East Germans could at first not travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:
* Elderly pensioners could travel to the West starting in 1965
* Visits of relatives for important family matters
* People who had to travel to the West for professional reasons (for example, artists, truck drivers, musicians, writers and so on.)

However, each visit had to be applied for individually and approval was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of [[East German Mark]]s into [[Deutsche Mark]]s (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (''[[Begrüßungsgeld]]'', or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.

Citizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.

Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war [[Four Powers]] Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin; the Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the [[Military Liaison Missions]] accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in [[Potsdam]].

Allied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:

;Transit between West Germany and West Berlin:
* '''Road:''' the Helmstedt-Berlin autobahn (A2) (Checkpoints Alpha and Bravo respectively). Soviet military personnel manned these checkpoints and processed Allied personnel for travel between the two points. Military personnel were required to be in uniform when traveling in this manner.
* '''Rail:''' Western Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces were forbidden from using commercial train service between West Germany and West Berlin, due to the fact of GDR passport and customs controls when using them. Instead, the Allied forces operated a series of official (duty) trains that traveled between their respective duty stations in West Germany and West Berlin. When transiting the GDR, the trains would follow the route between Helmstedt and Griebnitzsee, just outside of West Berlin. In addition to persons traveling on official business, authorized personnel could also use the duty trains for personal travel on a space-available basis. The trains traveled only at night, and as with transit by car, Soviet military personnel handled the processing of duty train travelers.

;Entry into and exit from East Berlin:
* [[Checkpoint Charlie]] (as a pedestrian or riding in a vehicle)

As with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR. This was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when crossing between East and West Berlin, which could jeopardize the overall Allied position governing the freedom of movement by Allied forces personnel within all Berlin.

Ordinary citizens of the Western Allied powers, not formally affiliated with the Allied forces, were authorized to use all designated transit routes through East Germany to and from West Berlin. Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstraße train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. In these instances, such travelers, unlike Allied personnel, had to submit to East German border controls.

===Defection attempts===
[[File:Conrad-schumann.jpg|thumb|[[National People's Army|NVA]] officer [[Conrad Schumann]] [[defection|defecting]] to West Berlin during the wall's early days in 1961.]]
During the years of the Wall, around 5,000 people successfully defected to West Berlin. The number of people who died trying to cross the wall, or as a result of the wall's existence, has been disputed. The most vocal claims by [[Alexandra Hildebrandt]], Director of the [[Checkpoint Charlie Museum]] and widow of the Museum's founder, estimated the death toll to be well above 200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Start/Index/id/593792 Chronik der Mauer: Todesopfer an der Berliner Mauer] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronik&quot;&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Common/Document/field/file/id/45997 Forschungsprojekt „Die Todesopfer an der Berliner Mauer, 1961-1989“: BILANZ (Stand: 7. August 2008) (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; A historic research group at the [[Center for Contemporary Historical Research]] ([[ZZF]]) in [[Potsdam]] has confirmed 136 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Start/Index/id/593792 Center for Contemporary Historical Research (Zentrum für Zeithistorische Forschung Potsdam e.V) in German]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior official figures listed 98 as being killed.

The East German government issued [[Schießbefehl|shooting orders]] to border guards dealing with defectors, though such orders are not the same as &quot;shoot to kill&quot; orders. GDR officials denied issuing the latter. In an October 1973 order later discovered by researchers, guards were instructed that people attempting to cross the wall were criminals and needed to be shot: &quot;Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCSept2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6943093.stm | publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-12 | accessdate=2007-08-12 | quote=A newly discovered order is the firmest evidence yet that the communist regime gave explicit shoot-to-kill orders, says Germany's director of Stasi files. | title=E German 'licence to kill' found}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early successful escapes involved people jumping the initial barbed wire or leaping out of apartment windows along the line, but these ended as the wall was fortified. East German authorities no longer permitted apartments near the wall to be occupied, and any building near the wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up. On August 15, 1961, [[Conrad Schumann]] was the first East German border guard to escape by jumping the barbed wire to West Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Conrad Schumann, 56, Symbol of E. Berlin escapes&quot;; North Sports Final Edition Associated Press. ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Ill.: Jun 23, 1998. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 1961 [[Ida Siekmann]] was the first casualty at the Berlin Wall: she died after she jumped out of her third floor apartment at 48 [[Bernauer Strasse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Start/Detail/id/593816/page/1 Biography] at Chronik der Mauer.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dramatic escape was carried out on April 1963 by [[Wolfgang Engels]], a 19-year-old civilian employee of the [[Nationale Volksarmee]]. Engels stole a Soviet [[armored personnel carrier]] from a base where he was deployed and drove it right into the wall. He was fired at and seriously wounded by border guards. But a West German policeman intervened, firing his weapon at the East German border guards. The policeman removed Engels from the vehicle, which had become entangled in the barbed wire.&lt;ref&gt;Hertle, Hans-Hermann (2008). ''The Berlin Wall: Monument of the Cold War''. Ch.

East Germans successfully defected by a variety of methods: digging long tunnels under the wall, waiting for favorable winds and taking a hot air balloon, sliding along aerial wires, flying [[ultralight aviation|ultralights]], and in one instance, simply driving a sports car at full speed through the basic, initial fortifications. When a metal beam was placed at checkpoints to prevent this kind of defection, up to four people (two in the front seats and possibly two in the boot) drove under the bar in a sports car that had been modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with the beam. They lay flat and kept driving forward. The East Germans then built zig-zagging roads at checkpoints. The sewer system predated the wall, and some people escaped through the sewers, in a number of cases with assistance from the [[Girrmann group|Girmann student group]].

An airborne escape was made by Thomas Krüger, who landed a [[Zlin Z 42]]M light aircraft of the Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik, an East German youth military training organization, at [[Gatow Airport|RAF Gatow]]. His aircraft, registration DDR-WOH, was dismantled and returned to the East Germans by road, complete with humorous slogans painted on by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] airmen such as &quot;Wish you were here&quot; and &quot;Come back soon&quot;. DDR-WOH is still flying today, but under the registration [[D-EWOH]].

If an escapee was wounded in a crossing attempt and lay on the death strip, no matter how close they were to the Western wall, Westerners could not intervene for fear of triggering engaging fire from the 'Grepos', the East Berlin border guards. The guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground, as in the most notorious failed attempt, that of [[Peter Fechter]] (aged 18). He was shot and bled to death, in full view of the Western media, on August 17, 1962. Fechter's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places, and provide medical care for possible “would-be escapers”.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Frederick . ''The Berlin Wall: A World Divided 1961-1989'', London: Harper Perennial, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The last person to be shot while trying to cross the border was [[Chris Gueffroy]] on February 6, 1989.

After allowing for loopholes throughout the summer, [[Hungary]] effectively disabled its physical border defenses with Austria on 19 August 1989 and, in September, more than 13,000 East German tourists escaped through Hungary to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/13/opinion/oe-meyer13|title=The picnic that brought down the Berlin Wall|first=Michael|last=Meyer|work=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]|date=13 September 2009|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set up a chain of events. The Hungarians prevented many more East Germans from crossing the border and returned them to Budapest. These East Germans flooded the West German embassy and refused to return to East Germany. The East German government responded by disallowing any further travel to Hungary, but allowed those already there to return. This triggered a similar incident in neighboring Czechoslovakia. On this occasion, the East German authorities allowed them to leave, providing that they used a train which transited East Germany on the way. This was followed by mass demonstrations within East Germany itself. (''See [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany]]''.) The longtime leader of East Germany, [[Erich Honecker]], resigned on 18 October 1989 and was replaced by [[Egon Krenz]] a few days later. Honecker had predicted in January of that year that the wall would stand for a 50 or 100 more years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Sie wird noch in 50 Jahren stehen&quot;|date=22 May 2009|publisher=dpa|url=http://www.dpa.de/Detailansicht-80er-Jahre.543+M517a9d5ff09.0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the conditions that had caused its construction did not change.

Protest demonstrations broke out all over East Germany in September 1989. Initially, protesters were mostly people wanting to leave to the West, chanting {{lang|de|''&quot;Wir wollen raus!&quot;}}'' (&quot;We want out!&quot;). Then protestors began to chant ''{{lang|de|&quot;Wir bleiben hier&quot;}}'', (&quot;We're staying here!&quot;). This was the start of what East Germans generally call the &quot;[[Peaceful revolution (German)|Peaceful Revolution]]&quot; of late 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mauerfall09.de |title={{lang|de|20 Jahre Mauerfall}} |accessdate=2009-04-09 | author=unknown | year=2009| publisher={{lang|de|Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest demonstrations grew considerably by early November. The movement neared its height on 4 November when half a million people gathered at the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]], a rally for change in East Berlin's large public square and transportation hub. (Henslin, 07)

Meanwhile, the wave of refugees leaving East Germany for the West had increased and had found its way through Hungary via Czechoslovakia (or via the West German Embassy in Prague), tolerated by the new Krenz government and in agreement with the communist Czechoslovak government. To ease the complications, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including West Berlin. On the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private travel. The new regulations were to take effect on 17 November 1989.

[[Günter Schabowski]], a spokesperson for the politburo, had the task of announcing this; however he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabowski&quot;&gt;Sarotte, Mary Elise (1 Nov 2009) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html &quot;How it went down: The little accident that toppled history&quot;] Washington Post. Retrieved 2009-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before a press conference on 9 November, he was handed a note that said that East Berliners would be allowed to cross the border with proper permission but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. These regulations had only been completed a few hours earlier and were to take effect the following day, so as to allow time to inform the border guards—however, nobody had informed Schabowski. He read the note out loud at the end of the conference. When the Italian journalist [[Riccardo Ehrman]], the Berlin correspondent of ANSA newsagency, asked when the regulations would come into effect, Schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note and replied &quot;As far as I know effective immediately, without delay&quot;. After further questions from journalists he confirmed that the regulations included the border crossings towards West Berlin, which he had not mentioned until then.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Marcus (21 Oct  2009) [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125597721400194603.html &quot;Did Brinkmannship Fell Berlin's Wall? Brinkmann Says It Did]&quot; The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-1110-018, Berlin, Checkpoint Charlie, Nacht des Mauerfalls.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Walking through [[Checkpoint Charlie]], 10 November 1989]]
Soon afterwards, a West German television channel, ARD, broadcast incomplete information from Schabowski's press conference. A moderator stated: &quot;This ninth of November is a historic day.&quot; &quot;East Germany has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabowski&quot; /&gt;

After hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the wall, demanding that border guards immediately open its gates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabowski&quot; /&gt; The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem, but it became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. In face of the growing crowd, the guards finally yielded, opening the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. Ecstatic East Berliners were soon greeted by West Berliners on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere.

===Demolition===
[[Image:berlin fallofwall emerson.jpg|thumb|left|An East German guard talks to a Westerner through a broken seam in the wall. Late November 1989.]]
[[Image:Crane removed part of Wall Brandenburg Gate.jpg|thumb|left|A crane removing a section of the Berlin Wall near [[Brandenburg Gate]] on 21 December 1989]]
The date on which the Wall fell is considered to have been 9 November 1989 but the Wall in its entirety was not torn down immediately. Starting that evening and in the days and weeks that followed, people came to the wall with sledgehammers or otherwise hammers and chisels to chip off souvenirs, demolishing lengthy parts of it in the process and creating several unofficial border crossings. These people were nicknamed &quot;Mauerspechte&quot; (wall woodpeckers).

The East German regime announced the opening of ten new [[Berlin Border Crossings|border crossings]] the following weekend, including some in historically significant locations ([[Potsdamer Platz]], [[Glienicker Brücke]], [[Bernauer Straße]]). Crowds on both sides waited there for hours, cheering at the bulldozers which took parts of the Wall away to reinstate old roads. Photos and television footage of these events is sometimes mislabelled &quot;dismantling of the Wall&quot;, even though it was merely the construction of new crossings. New border crossings continued to be opened through the middle of 1990, including the [[Brandenburg Gate]] on 22 December 1989.

West Germans and West Berliners were allowed visa-free travel starting 23 December. Until then, they could only visit East Germany and East Berlin under restrictive conditions that involved application for a visa several days or weeks in advance and obligatory exchange of at least 25 [[Deutsche mark|DM]] per day of their planned stay, all of which hindered spontaneous visits. Thus, in the weeks between 9 November and 23 December, East Germans could actually travel more freely than Westerners.

[[Image:Berlin wall 1990.jpg|left|thumb|Almost all of the remaining sections of Berlin Wall were rapidly chipped away. Photo December 1990]]

Television coverage of citizens demolishing sections of the wall on the evening of 9 November and the new border crossings opened weeks later, led some foreigners to think the Wall was torn down quickly. Technically, the Wall remained guarded for some time after 9 November, though at a decreasing intensity. In the first months, the East German military even tried to repair some of the damages done by the &quot;wall peckers&quot;. Gradually these attempts ceased, and guards became more lax, tolerating the increasing demolitions and &quot;unauthorized&quot; border crossing through the holes. On 13 June 1990, the official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military began in Bernauer Straße. On 1 July, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all ''de jure'' border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that. The dismantling continued to be carried out by military units (after unification under the [[Bundeswehr]]) and lasted until November 1991. Only a few short sections and watchtowers were left standing as memorials.

The fall of the Wall was the first step toward German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.

===Opposition===
In some European capitals at the time there was a deep anxiety over prospects for a reunified Germany. In September 1989, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] pleaded with [[Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] not to let the Berlin Wall fall and confided that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindu2009.9.15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/09/15/stories/2009091553501100.htm |title=How Margaret Thatcher pleaded with Gorbachev not to let the Berlin Wall fall out of london |accessdate=2009-11-08 |date=September 15, 2009 |work=Hasan Suroor |publisher=Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2009.9.11&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6829735.ece |title=Thatcher told Gorbachev Britain did not want German reunification |accessdate=2009-11-08 |date=September 11, 2009 |work=Michael Binyon |publisher=Times | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, [[French President]] [[François Mitterrand]] warned Thatcher that a unified Germany could make more ground than [[Adolf Hitler]] ever had and that Europe would have to bear the consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2009.9.10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6828556.ece |title=United Germany might allow another Hitler, Mitterrand told Thatcher |accessdate=2009-11-09 |date=September 10, 2009 |work=Helen Nugent |publisher=Times | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrations===
On 25 December 1989, [[Leonard Bernstein]] gave a concert in Berlin celebrating the end of the Wall, including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th symphony]] (''[[Ode to Joy]]'') with the word &quot;Joy&quot; ''({{lang|de|Freude}})'' changed to &quot;Freedom&quot; ''({{lang|de|Freiheit}})'' in the lyrics sung. The orchestra and choir were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naxos 2072038&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=2072038 |title=Ode To Freedom – Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (NTSC)|accessdate = 2006-11-26 |author=Naxos |authorlink=Naxos Records |year=2006 |work=Naxos.com Classical Music Catalogue}} This is the publisher's catalogue entry for a DVD of Bernstein's Christmas 1989 &quot;Ode to Freedom&quot; concert. David Hasselhoff sang during the fall of the Berlin wall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Waters]] [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|performed]] the [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Wall]]'' just north of [[Potsdamer Platz]] on 21 July 1990, with guests including [[Bon Jovi]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Levon Helm]], [[Rick Danko]] and [[Van Morrison]]. [[David Hasselhoff]] performed his song &quot;[[Looking for Freedom (song)|Looking for Freedom]]&quot;, which was very popular in Germany at that time, standing on the Berlin wall.

Over the years, there has been a repeated controversial debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://debatte.welt.de/kontroverse/48213/soll+der+9+november+nationalfeiertag+werden |title=Soll der 9.

However, 9 November is also the anniversary of the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and the infamous ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' [[pogrom]]s of the Nazis in 1938. [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Elie Wiesel]] criticized the first euphoria, noting that &quot;they forgot that 9 Nov. has already entered into history—51 years earlier it marked the Kristallnacht.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiesel 1989&quot;&gt;{{cite |title=New York Times |date=1989-11-17}} – Elie Wiesel, &quot;Op-Ed in response to the fall of the wall&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As reunification was not official and complete until 3 October, that day was finally chosen as [[German Unity Day]].

===20th Anniversary Celebrations===
On 9 November 2009, Berlin celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall with a &quot;Festival of Freedom&quot; with dignitaries from around the world in attendance for an evening celebration around the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. A high point was when over 1,000 colourfully designed foam domino tiles, each over {{convert|8|ft|m}} tall, that were stacked along the former route of the wall in the city center were toppled in stages, converging in front of the Brandenburg Gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown 2009&quot;/&gt;

A [http://www.berlintwitterwall.com/ Berlin Twitter Wall] was set up to allow [[Twitter]] users to post messages commemorating the 20th anniversary. Masses of Chinese users have used it to protest the [[Great Firewall of China]]. Berlin Twitter Wall was quickly blocked by the Chinese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=34897 RSF.org]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/points-east/mr-hu-tear-down-this-firewall/article1338387/ TheGlobeAndMail.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/technology/BERLIN+WALL+CHINA+MARKS+DATE/2193355/story.html MontrealGazette.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the German Embassy coordinated a public diplomacy campaign with the motto &quot;Freedom Without Walls&quot;, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The campaign was focused on promoting awareness of the fall of the Berlin Wall among current college students. Students at over 30 universities participated in &quot;Freedom Without Walls&quot; events in late 2009. First place winner of the [http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/09__Press__InFocus__Interviews/03__Infocus/04__Without__Walls/FWW__Speaking__Winners__VA.html Freedom Without Walls Speaking Contest] Robert Cannon received a free trip to Berlin for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.germany.info/withoutwalls |title=Freedom Without Walls |accessdate=2009-04-09 | author=unknown | year=2009| publisher=Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international project called ''Mauerreise'' (Journey of the Wall) took place in various countries. Twenty symbolic wall bricks were sent from Berlin starting in May 2009. Their destination: Korea, Cyprus, Yemen and other places where everyday life is characterised by division and border experience. In these places, the bricks will become a blank canvas for artists, intellectuals and young people to tackle the 「wall」 phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/prj/mar/enindex.htm |title=The Wall in the World 2009 – 20th anniversary of the Fall of the Wall – Goethe-Institut |publisher=Goethe.de |date= |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Spy Museum]] in Washington DC hosted a [[Trabant]] car rally where 20 Trabants gathered in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Rides were raffled every half hour and a Trabant crashed through a Berlin Wall mock up. The Trabant was the East German people's car that many used to leave DDR after the collapse.

The [[Allied Museum]] in the [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] district of Berlin hosted a number of events to mark the Twentieth Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. The museum held a Special Exhibition entitled &quot;Wall Patrol – The Western Powers and the Berlin Wall 1961-1990&quot; which focused on the daily patrols deployed by the Western powers to observe the situation along the Berlin Wall and the fortifications on the [[East Germany|GDR]] [[Inner German border|border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliiertenmuseum.de/en/4_2.php?year=&amp;activity_id=214 |title=Wall Patrol – The Western Powers and the Berlin Wall 1961-1990 Special Exhibition |accessdate=2010-07-23 | author=Allied Musem | year=2009| publisher=Allied Museum, Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sheet of &quot;Americans in Berlin&quot; Commemorative [[Cinderella stamp]]s designed by T.H.E.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Little is left of the Wall at its original site, which was destroyed almost everywhere. Three long sections are still standing: an 80-metre (263&amp;nbsp;ft) piece of the first (westernmost) wall at the [[Topography of Terror]], site of the former [[Gestapo]] headquarters, half way between [[Checkpoint Charlie]] and [[Potsdamer Platz]]; a longer section of the second (easternmost) wall along the [[Spree]] River near the [[Oberbaumbrücke]], nicknamed [[East Side Gallery]]; and a third section that is partly reconstructed, in the north at [[Bernauer Straße]], which was turned into a memorial in 1999. Some other isolated fragments and a few watchtowers also remain in various parts of the city.

None still accurately represents the Wall's original appearance. They are badly damaged by souvenir seekers. Fragments of the Wall were taken and some were sold around the world. Appearing both with and without [[Certificate of Authenticity|certificates of authenticity]], these fragments are now a staple on the online auction service [[eBay]] as well as German souvenir shops. Today, the eastern side is covered in [[graffiti]] that did not exist while the Wall was guarded by the armed soldiers of East Germany. Previously, graffiti appeared only on the western side. Along the tourist areas of the city centre, the city government has marked the location of the former wall by a row of cobblestones in the street. In most places only the &quot;first&quot; wall is marked, except near Potsdamer Platz where the stretch of both walls is marked, giving visitors an impression of the dimension of the barrier system.

===Museum===
15 years after the fall, a private museum rebuilt a 200-metre (656&amp;nbsp;ft) section close to [[Checkpoint Charlie]], although not in the location of the original wall. They temporarily erected more than 1,000 crosses in memory of those who died attempting to flee to the West. The memorial was installed in October 2004 and demolished in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Furlong, Ray | title=Berlin Wall memorial is torn down | publisher=BBC News|date=July 5, 2005 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4651823.stm | accessdate = 2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural differences===
For many years after reunification, people in Germany talked about cultural differences between East and West Germans (colloquially ''[[Ossi (East Germans)|Ossis]]'' and ''[[Wessi]]s''), sometimes described as ''Mauer im Kopf'' (The wall in the head). A September 2004 poll found that 25 percent of West Germans and 12 percent of East Germans wished that East and West should be separated again by a &quot;Wall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reuters | title=One in 5 Germans wants Berlin Wall rebuilt | publisher=MSNBC | date=September 8, 2004 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5942091/ | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060613190725/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5942091/ | archivedate=2006-06-13 | accessdate = 2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll taken in October 2009 on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the wall indicated, however, that only about a tenth of the population was still unhappy with the unification (8 percent in the East; 12 percent in the West). Although differences are still perceived between East and West, Germans make similar distinctions between North and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=ZDF &quot;Wochenjournal&quot; | title=Große Zustimmung zur Wiedervereinigung | publisher=ZDF | date=November 5, 2009 | url=http://wochenjournal.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/11/0,1872,7925355,00.html | accessdate = 2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent poll conducted by Russia's VTsIOM, found that more than half of all Russians do not know who built the Berlin Wall. Ten percent of people surveyed thought Berlin residents built it themselves. Six percent said Western powers built it and four percent thought it was a &quot;bilateral initiative&quot; of the [[Soviet Union]] and the West. Fifty-eight percent said they did not know who built it, with just 24 percent correctly naming the Soviet Union and its then-communist ally East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE5A44NS20091105?feedType=nl&amp;feedName=ukoddlyenough Reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall segments around the world===
{{Main|List of Berlin Wall segments}}
Not all segments of the wall were ground up as the wall was being torn down. Many segments have been given to various institutions around the world. They can be found, for instance in presidential and historical museums, lobbies of hotels and corporations, at universities and government buildings, and in public spaces around the world.

'''Bass''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|eɪ|s}} {{respell|bays}}) describes [[Pitch (music)|tone]]s of low [[frequency]] or [[range (music)|range]].  Played in an [[musical ensemble|ensemble]]/[[orchestra]], such notes are frequently used to provide a [[counterpoint]] or counter-[[melody]], in a [[harmony|harmonic]] context either to outline or juxtapose the progression of the [[chord (music)|chord]]s, or with [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] to underline the [[rhythm]]. In popular music the bass part most often provides harmonic and rhythmic support, usually playing the root or fifth of the chord and stressing the strong beats.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Priestley Burning Lens Replica.jpg|thumb|A replica (on a smaller scale) of the burning lens owned by [[Joseph Priestley]], in his laboratory]]
A '''burning glass''' or '''burning lens''' is a large [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex lens]] that can concentrate the [[sun]]'s rays onto a small area, heating up the area and thus resulting in [[Combustion|ignition]] of the exposed surface. '''Burning mirrors''' achieve a similar effect by using reflecting surfaces to focus the light. They were used in 18th-century chemical studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the products of [[combustion]] could be trapped for analysis. The burning glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition was easily achieved.

==History==
The technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity. Vases filled with water used to start fires were known in the ancient world, and metaphorical significance was drawn (by the early [[Church Fathers]], for instance) from the fact that the water remained cool even though the light passing through it would set materials on fire. Burning lenses were used to [[cauterise]] wounds and to light sacred fires in temples. ''[[Plutarch]]'' refers to a burning mirror made of joined triangular metal mirrors installed at the temple of the [[Vestal Virgins]]. [[Aristophanes]] mentions the burning lens in his play ''[[The Clouds]]'' (424 BC).

[[Archimedes]], the renowned mathematician, was said to have used a burning glass (or more likely a large number of angled hexagonal mirrors) as a weapon in 212 BC, when [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was besieged by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]. The [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] was supposedly incinerated, though eventually the city was taken and Archimedes was slain.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, Fik (1986), A History of Seafaring in the Classical World, Routledge, ISBN 978-0709935650&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Archimedes gave rise to a considerable amount of research on burning glasses and lenses until the late 17th century. Successful recreations have been performed by [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (6th century AD), Proclus (6th century) (who by this means purportedly destroyed the fleet of Vitellus besieging [[Constantinople]]), [[Ibn Sahl]] in his ''On Burning Mirrors and Lenses'' (10th century), [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021),&lt;ref&gt;Roshdi Rashed (1990), &quot;A Pioneer in Anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on Burning Mirrors and Lenses&quot;, ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''81''' (3), p. 464-491 [464-468].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Bacon]] (13th century), [[Giambattista della Porta]] and his friends (16th century), [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[Gaspar Schott]] (17th century), the Comte du Buffon in 1740 in Paris, Ioannis Sakas in the 1970s in Greece, and others. Sakas was able to ignite a wooden boat at some distance in only seconds. Buffon, using only 48 small mirrors, was able to melt a 3 kilogram (six pound) tin bottle, and ignite wood from a distance of 46 meters (150&amp;nbsp;ft). These recreations show the plausibility of Archimedes' achievement.

The pop science TV program ''[[MythBusters]]'' attempted to model Archimedes' feat by using mirrors to ignite a small wooden boat covered with tar, with only partial success—they found it too difficult to focus light from their hand-held mirrors onto a point small enough to ignite the boat. However, an episode of [[Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections]] relating to the [[Keck Observatory]] (whose reflector glass is based on the Archimedes' Mirror) did successfully use a much smaller curved mirror to burn a wooden model, though not made of the same quality of materials as in the ''MythBusters'' effort.

Recent excavations at the [[Viking]] harbor town of Fröjel, [[Gotland]] in [[Sweden]] have revealed a small number of rock crystal lenses known as the [[Visby lenses]].  These may have been made using pole-lathes. They have an imaging quality comparable to that of 1950s [[aspheric lens]]es. The Viking lenses effectively concentrate sunlight enough to ignite fires; however it is not known whether they were used for this purpose. Similar technology may have been used in ancient Ireland (the Liath Meisicith){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and quite possibly ancient Egypt {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

In 1796, during the [[French Revolution]] and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, [[Étienne-Gaspard Robert]] met with the French government and proposed the use of mirrors to burn the invading ships of the British [[Royal Navy]].  They decided not to take up his proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;PreCinema&quot;&gt;Burns, Paul.  &quot;[http://www.precinemahistory.net/1750.htm The History of The Discovery of Cinematography: Chapter Six 1750-1799]&quot;.  Accessed 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 17 of [[William Bates (physician)|William Bates]]' 1920 book ''Perfect Sight Without Glasses'', in which the author argues that observation of the sun is beneficial to those with poor vision, includes a figure of somebody ''&quot;Focussing the Rays of the Sun Upon the Eye of a Patient by Means of a Burning Glass.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;BatesChap17&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bates | first=William H. | title=Perfect Sight Without Glasses | year=1920 | chapter = Chapter 17: Vision Under Adverse Conditions a Benefit to the Eye | pages=183–197 | publisher=New York: Central Fixation Publish Co. | chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0 | isbn=8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, this is highly dangerous and will damage the eye in seconds.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Other uses|Beacon (disambiguation)}}

A '''beacon''' is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a specific location. 

Beacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important [[information]], such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its [[aerodrome beacon|airport beacon]], or of pending weather as indicated on a [[weather beacon]] mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical_telegraph|optical telegraphy]].

== For navigation ==
[[File:Beacon at Orontes Bank.jpg|right|thumb|A navigational beacon denoting the presence of Orontes Bank off [[Port Vincent, South Australia]].]] 

Beacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''lights''; unlighted beacons are called ''daybeacon''s.

== For defensive communications ==
[[File:Culmstock, Culmstock Beacon - geograph.org.uk - 213525.jpg|thumb|left|C16th beacon hut in Devon, England]]
Classically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[Navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses.  As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]]y, and were part of a [[relay league]]. 

Systems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. In [[Scandinavia]] many [[hill forts]] were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In [[Wales]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] were named for beacons used to warn of approaching [[England|English]] raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in [[Elizabethan England]] to warn of the approaching [[Spanish Armada]]. Many hills in [[England]] were named [[Beacon Hill]] after such beacons. In the [[Scottish borders]] country a system of beacon fires were at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. [[Hume Castle|Hume]], Eggerstone castle and Soltra Edge were part of this network.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Leitch (1835). ''Scott and Scotland''. London : Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== On vehicles ==

Vehicular beacons are typically rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians. Emergency vehicles such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.  

The color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles. Amber lights are used for tow trucks, security personnel, and construction vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with traditional incandescent bulbs, xenon [[flashtube]]s, or LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evaluation of Light-Emitting Diode Beacon Light Fixtures | journal = Lighting Research Center - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute | date = 2009-12 | first = John | last = Bullough | coauthors = Nicholas P Skinner| id = | url = http://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century light sources required the vehicle’s engine to continue running to ensure that the battery would not be depleted when the lights were used for more than a few hours. The energy efficiency of the LED source allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the light flashes.

== Other uses ==

Beacons and [[bonfire]]s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events. In [[Israel]] beacons identify the beginning of the month.

Beacons have also been abused by [[pirate]]s. An illicit fire at a wrong position could be used to direct a ship against [[shoal]]s or [[beach]]es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground.

== In fiction ==

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', a series of seven beacons is used as a signaling device between [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]].  [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/b/beaconsofgondor.html]  In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|film adaptation of ''The Return of the King'']], [[Gandalf]] has [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] light the beacon closest to [[Minas Tirith]].  The series is then lit, thereby notifying Rohan's King [[Théoden]] that Gondor calls for help in the battle against [[Sauron]].

==History==
{{Pakistanimusic}}
{{Indianmusic}}
Bhangra dance is based on music from a Punjabi folk drum,folk singing, a single-stringed instrument called the [[iktar]], the [[tumbi]] and the [[chimta]]. The accompanying songs are small [[couplet]]s written in the [[Punjabi language]] called ''bolis''. In Punjabi folk music, the dhol's smaller cousin, the [[dholki]], was nearly always used to provide the main beat. Nowadays, the dhol is used more frequently.  Additional [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], including [[tabla]], is less frequently used in bhangra as a solo instrument but is sometimes used to accompany the dhol and dholki.  This rhythm serves as a common thread that allows for easy commingling between Punjabi folk and reggae, as demonstrated by such artists as the UK's [[Apache Indian]].&lt;ref name = &quot;htyxku&quot;&gt;Sharma, Sanjay. &quot;Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?&quot; In ''Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of the New Asian Dance Music''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Apache Indian]]&lt;/ref&gt;'

In the late 1960s and 1970s, several Punjabi Sikh bands from the United Kingdom set the stage for bhangra to become a form of music instead of being just a dance. The success of many Punjabi artists based in the United Kingdom created a [[fanbase]], inspired new artists, and found large amounts of support in both Pakistani and Indian Punjab. These artists, some of whom are still active today, include, [[Heera Group]], [[Alaap band]], [[A.S. Kang]] and [[Apna Sangeet]].  Folk singers of Punjab have also contributed to the development of bhangra in the UK. These artists are Alam Lohar and Yamla Jatt.

===In the 1980s===
Major migrations of [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] to the UK brought bhangra music, which became popular in Britain during the 1980s, although heavily influenced in Britain by the infusion of rock sounds and a need to move away from the simple and repetitive Punjabi folk music. It signaled the development of a self-conscious and distinctively [[British Asian]] [[youth culture]] centred on an experiential sense of self, e.g., language, gesture, bodily signification, desires, etc., in a situation in which tensions with British culture and [[racist]] elements in British society had resulted in [[Social alienation|alienation]] in many [[Minority group|minority ethnic groups]], fostered a sense of need for an affirmation of a positive identity and culture, and provided a platform for British Punjabi males to assert their masculinity.&lt;ref name = &quot;htyxku&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sehyon.com/bhangra.htm Sehyon.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], a composer of bhangra music&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;xucwva&quot;&gt;[https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/sharma_noisy-asians.pdf Moodle.brandeis.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f2bb9fc-d03b-11da-b160-0000779e2340.html FT.com / Arts &amp; Weekend - What's right with Asian boys&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhangra dancing was originally considered a male dance, a &quot;man's song&quot;, with strong, intense movements. However, &quot;Second-generation South Asian American women are increasingly turning to bhangra as a way of defining cultural identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sawnet.org/articles/return_to_bhangra.html Return to Bhangra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Bhangra artists were selling over 30,000 cassettes a week in the UK, but not one artist made their way into the Top 40 UK Chart despite these artists outselling popular British ones; most of the Bhangra cassette sales were not through the large UK record stores, whose sales were those recorded by the Official UK Charts Company for creating their rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dholclips.com DholClips.com - Bhangra Videos, Punjabi Songs, Punjabi MP3s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s is also what is commonly known as the golden age, or what the &quot;bhangraheads&quot; refer to as the age of bhangra music, which lasted roughly from 1985 to 1993. The primary emphasis during these times was on the melody/riff (played out usually on a synthesizer/harmonium/accordion or a guitar); the musician/composer received as much fanfare, if not more, than the vocalist.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The folk instruments were rarely used, because it was agreed that the music was independent of the instruments being used.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

This era saw the very first bhangra boy band, called the [[Sahotas]], a band made up of five brothers from [[Wolverhampton]], UK. Their music is a fusion of bhangra, rock and dance.

One of the biggest bhangra stars of the last several decades is [[Malkit Singh]] — known as &quot;the golden voice of the Punjab&quot; — and his group, Golden Star. Malkit was born in June 1963 in the village of Hussainpur in Punjab. He attended the Khalsa College, Jalandhar, in Punjab in 1980 to study for a bachelor of arts degree. There he met his mentor, Professor Inderjit Singh, who nurtured his skills in Punjabi folk singing and bhangra dancing. Due to Singh's tutelage, Malkit entered and won many song contests during this time. In 1983, he won a gold medal at the Guru Nanak Dev University in [[Amritsar]], Punjab, for performing his hit song &quot;Gurh Naloo Ishq Mitha&quot;, which later featured on his first album, ''Nach Gidhe Wich'', released in 1984. The album was a strong hit among South Asians worldwide, and after its release, Malkit and his band moved to the United Kingdom to continue their work. Malkit has
now produced 16 albums and has toured 27 countries in his bhangra career. Malkit has been awarded the prestigious MBE by the British Queen for his services to bhangra music.  In the 2000's one particular bhangra singer, 
Lehmber Hussainpuri, rose to a fame for his distinctive voice.  Lehmber has had many hits such as Das Ja, Sadi Gali, Ah ni Kuriye, Ne Baliye and much more.

The group Alaap, fronted by Channi Singh, the man made famous by his white scarf, hails from [[Southall]], a Punjabi area in London. Their album ''Teri Chunni De Sitaray'', released in 1982 by Multitone, created quite a stir at a time when bhangra was still in its early days in the UK. This album played a critical role in creating an interest in bhangra among Asian university students in Britain {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  The music produced for Alaap included the pioneering sounds by Deepak Khazanchi {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

[[Heera Group UK|Heera]], formed by Bhupinder Bhindi and fronted by Kumar and Dhami, was one of the most popular bands of the 1980s {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Fans were known to [[gate-crash]] weddings where they played {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The group established itself with the albums ''Jag Wala Mela'', produced by music maestro of the time [[Kuljit Bhamra]], and ''Diamonds from Heera'', produced by Deepak Khazanchi, the man behind the new sound of UK bhangra, on Arishma records. These albums are notable for being amongst the first bhangra albums to mix Western drums and synthesizers with traditional Punjabi instruments successfully.

Bands like Alaap and Heera incorporated rock-influenced beats into bhangra, because it enabled &quot;Asian youth to affirm their identities positively&quot; within the broader environment of alternative rock as an alternative way of expression. However, some believe that the progression of bhangra music created an &quot;intermezzo culture&quot; post-India's partition, within the unitary definitions of Southeast Asians within the diaspora, thus &quot;establishing a brand new community in their home away from home&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdnvra&quot;&gt;Sharma, Sanjay. &quot;Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?&quot; In ''Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of the New Asian Dance Music'', ed.

London: Zed Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focusanthro.org/essays0405/nalikagajaweera0405.htm The Discontents of the Hyphenated Identity: Second Generation British Asian Youth Culture and Fusion Music&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other influential groups appeared around the same time, including The Saathies, Premi Group, Bhujungy Group, and Apna Sangeet. Apna Sangeet, best known for their hit &quot;Mera Yaar Vajavey Dhol&quot;, re-formed  for charity in May 2009 after a break-up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonaweb.co.uk/blog/47-blog/71-blogbhangraapnasangeeet Sonaweb.co.uk], Bhangra superstars choose Sona Web&lt;/ref&gt;

When bhangra and Indian sounds and lyrics were brought together, British-Asian artists began incorporating them in their music. Certain Asian artists, such as Bally Sagoo, [[Talvin Singh]], Badmarsh, Black Star Liner, and State of Bengal, are creating their own form of British [[hip-hop]].

Even more well-established groups, such as [[Cornershop]], Fun-Da-Mental, and [[Asian Dub Foundation]], are finding different means and methods to create new sounds that other Asian groups have never formed.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jeff. &quot;It's a Hip-hop World.&quot; Foreign Policy 163, November/December 2007, 58-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  By mixing the sounds of bhangra with the popular sounds of hard rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], Asians are able to stay true to their own culture, while being open to a world of change.  Many British Asians are conscious of both cultures in their everyday life and now are doing so in their music as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1018545,00.html#article_continue | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The big bhangra | first=Vivek | last=Chaudhary | date=2003-08-15 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 1990s===
Bhangra took large steps toward mainstream credibility in the 1990s, especially among youths. At the beginning of the nineties, many artists returned to the original, folk beats away from bhangra music, often incorporating more dhol drum beats and tumbi. This time also saw the rise of several young Punjabi singers.

Beginning around 1994, there was a trend towards the use of samples (often sampled from mainstream hip hop) mixed with traditional folk rhythm instruments, such as the tumbi and dhol.  Using folk instruments, hip-hop samples, along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from Punjab, Punjabi folk music was able to abolish bhangra music.

An influential singer was the &quot;Canadian folkster&quot;, [[Jazzy B]], who debuted in 1992. Having sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, ''Folk and Funky'', he is now one of the best-selling Punjabi folk artists in the world, with a vocal style likened to that of [[Kuldip Manak]].

Other influential folk artists include [[Surinder Shinda]] - famous for his &quot;Putt Jattan De&quot; - [[Harbhajan Mann]], [[Manmohan Waris]], Meshi Eshara, [[Sarbjit Cheema]], [[Hans Raj Hans]], [[Sardool Sikander]], [[Sahotas]], Geet the MegaBand, Anakhi, Sat Rang, XLNC, B21, Shaktee, Intermix, Sahara, [[Paaras]], [[PDM]]{{dn}}, Amar Group, Sangeet Group, and [[Bombay Talkie (band)|Bombay Talkie]].  A DJ to rise to stardom with many successful hits was [[Panjabi MC]].

In 2010, the story of how bhangra arrived and developed in the UK was told in the stage musical ''Britain's Got Bhangra'', produced by Rifco Arts. The show was the first ever bhangra musical, with much of the show in Punjabi, making use of the live dhol, dholak and tabla throughout, and has traditional folk melodies as well as an original score by Sumeet Chopra with crossovers into pop, rap and R&amp;B.  The production had its world premiere at Theatre Royal Stratford East in May 2010 and went on a UK Tour {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Another major tour is expected in 2011 {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

==Dances==
[[Image:Dhol players.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bhangra [[tournament]] concert]]

Bhangra has developed as a combination of dances from different parts of the Punjab region. The term ''Bhangra'' now refers to several kinds of dances and arts, including Jhumar, Luddi, Giddha, Julli, Daankara, Dhamal, Saami, Kikli, and Gatka.

* Jhumar, originally from Sandalbar, Punjab, comprises an important part of Punjab folk heritage. It is a graceful dance, based on a specific Jhumar rhythm. Dancers circle around a drum player while singing a soft chorus.
* A person performing the Luddi dance places one hand behind his head and the other in front of his face, while swaying his head and arms. He typically wears a plain loose shirt and sways in a snake-like manner. Like a Jhumar dancer, the Luddi dancer moves around a dhol player.
* Women have a different and much milder dance called [[Giddha]]. The dancers enact verses called bolis, representing a wide variety of subjects&amp;mdash;everything from arguments with a sister-in-law to political affairs. The rhythm of the dance depends on the drums and the hand claps of the dancers.
* Daankara is a dance of celebration, typically performed at weddings. Two men, each holding colorful staves, dance around each other in a circle while tapping their sticks together in rhythm with the drums.
* Dancers also form a circle while performing Dhamal. They also hold their arms high, shake their shoulders and heads, and yell and scream. Dhamal is a true folk dance, representing the heart of bhangra.
* Women of the Sandalbar region traditionally are known for the Saami. The dancers dress in brightly colored kurtas and full flowing skirts called lehengas.
* Like Daankara, Kikli features pairs of dancers, this time women. The dancers cross their arms, hold each other's hands, and whirl around singing folk songs. Occasionally, four girls join hands to perform this dance.
* Gatka is a Punjabi Sikh martial art in which people use swords, sticks, or daggers. Historians believe that the sixth Sikh guru started the art of Gatka after the martyrdom of fifth guru, [[Guru Arjan Dev]]. Wherever there is a large Punjabi [[Sikh]] population, there will be Gatka participants, often including small children and adults. These participants usually perform Gatka on special Punjabi holidays.

In addition to these different dances, a bhangra performance typically contains many energetic stunts. The most popular stunt is called the moor, or peacock, in which a dancer sits on someone's shoulders, while another person hangs from his torso by his legs. Two-person towers, pyramids, and various spinning stunts are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redearthindia.com/articles/bhangra.pdf Redearthindia.com], Roy Anjali Gera; &quot;Bhangra in the Global Bazaar&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outfits==
Traditional men wear a [[lungi|chaadra]] while doing bhangra. A chaadra is a piece of cloth wrapped around the waist. Men also wear a [[kurta]], which is a long Indian-style shirt. In addition, men wear [[pagadi]] (also known as turbans) to cover their heads.

In modern times, men also wear turla, the fan attached to the pagadi. Colorful vests are worn above the kurta. Fumans (small balls attached to ropes) are worn on each arm.

Women wear a traditional Punjabi dress known as a [[salwar kameez]], long baggy pants tight at the ankle (salwar) and a long colorful shirt (kameez). Women also wear [[dupatta|chunnis]], colorful pieces of cloth wrapped around the neck.

These items are all very colorful and vibrant, representing the rich rural colors of Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baisakhifestival.com/baisakhi-dress.html Baisakhi Dress, Bhangra Dress, Gidda Dress, Dress for Baisakhi Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the above, the bhangra dress has different parts that are listed below in detail:
*Turla or torla,  a fan-like adornment on the turban
*[[Pagri (turban)|Pag]] (turban, a sign of pride/honor in Punjab). This is tied differently than the traditional turban one sees Sikhs wearing in the street. This turban has to be tied before each show.
*[[Kurta]], similar to a silk shirt, with about four buttons, very loose with embroidered patterns
*[[Lungi]] or chadar, a loose loincloth tied around the dancer's waist, which is usually very decorated
*Jugi, a waistcoat with no buttons
*[[Rumāl]], small &quot;scarves&quot; worn on the fingers. They look very elegant and are effective when the hands move during the course of bhangra performance.

==Lyrics==
Bhangra lyrics, always sung in the Punjabi language, generally cover social issues, such as love, relationships, money, dancing, getting drunk and marriage. Additionally, there are countless bhangra songs devoted to Punjabi pride themes and Punjabi heroes. The lyrics are tributes to the rich cultural traditions of the Punjabis. In particular, many bhangra tracks have been written about [[Udham Singh]] and [[Bhagat Singh]]. Less serious topics include beautiful ladies with their colorful [[Dupatta|duppattas]] and dancing and drinking in the fields of the Punjab.

Bhangra singers do not sing in the same tone of voice as their Southeast Asian counterparts. Rather, they employ a high, energetic tone of voice. Singing fiercely and with great pride, they typically add nonsensical, random noises to their singing. Likewise, often people dancing to Bhangra will yell phrases such as ''hoi, hoi, hoi''; ''[[Balle Balle|balle balle]]''; ''chak de''; ''oye hoi''; ''bruah ''(for an extended length of about 2–5 seconds); ''haripa''; or ''ch-ch'' (mostly used as slow beats called Chummer/Jhoomer) to the music.

One famous bhangra or Punjabi lyricist is [[Harbans Jandu]] (Jandu Littranwala), who has written famous songs such as &quot;Giddhian Di Rani&quot;.

==Instruments==
Many different Punjabi instruments contribute to the sound of bhangra. Although the most important instrument is the keyboard, bhangra also features a variety of string and other drum instruments.

The primary and most important instrument that defines bhangra is the [[dhol]]. The dhol is a large, high-bass drum, played by beating it with two sticks - known as ''daggah'' (bass end) and ''tilli'' (treble end). The width of a dhol skin is about fifteen inches in general, and the dhol player holds his instrument with a strap around his neck.

The string instruments include the [[guitar]] (both acoustic and electrical), [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[sitar]], [[tumbi]], [[violin]] and [[sarangi]]. The [[Snare drum|snare]], [[Tom-tom drum|toms]], [[dhad sarangi|dhad]], [[dafli]], [[dholki]], and [[damru]] are the other drums. The tumbi, originally played by folk artists such as Lalchand Yamla Jatt and Kuldip Manak in true folk recordings and then famously mastered by [[chamkila]], a famous Punjabi folk singer (not bhangra singer), is a high-tone, single-string instrument. It has only one string; however, it is difficult to master. The sarangi is a multi-stringed instrument, somewhat similar to the violin and is played using meends. The sapera produces a beautiful, high-pitched stringy beat, while the supp and chimta add an extra, light sound to bhangra music. Finally, the dhad, dafli, dholki, and damru are instruments that produce more drum beats, but with much less bass than the dhol drum.

The keyboard and guitar are the most important melodic instruments used in bhangra, with even the sitar being used on certain albums.

===Percussion===
With skilled keyboard, tumbi, guitar and dhol players, bhangra today has evolved into a largely beat-based music genre, unlike until 1994, when it was slightly more mellow and classical. [[Pandit Dinesh]] and [[Kuljit Bhamra]] were trained exponents of Indian percussion and helped create the current UK sound, albeit mainly with tabla and dholki for bands like [[Alaap]] and [[Heera Group UK|Heera]]. The generation that followed became overly dependent on folk music.

Talented 15-year-old percussionist Bhupinder Singh Kullar, aka [[Tubsy]], of Handsworth, Birmingham, created a more contemporary style and groove that seemed to fuse more naturally with Western music. Songs such as &quot;Dhola veh Dhola&quot; (Satrang) and albums such as ''Bomb the Tumbi'' (Safri Boyz) contained this new style and were very successful.

Then came [[Sunil Kalyan]] of Southall, London, who also sessioned on many songs and albums. He added a smoothness and sweetness never heard before on the tabla, hailing him as one of the best tabla players in UK bhangra.

[[Sukhshinder Shinda]] later introduced his unique style of dhol playing with the album ''Dhol Beat''. He added a very clean style of dhol playing and helped create the sound for artists such as Jaswinder Singh Bains and [[Bhinda Jatt]]. He was regarded at the time as the best dhol player in UK.

Another influential percussionist was [[:Parvinder Bharat]] [[:(Parv)]] of Wolverhampton, who for many years had been percussionist for DCS' his style, speed and improvisational skills were second to none. Parv also introduced playing the dholak and tabla top end (dhayan) with great effect into the live bhangra scene, a style that has been adopted by most bhangra percussionists ever since.

Other important percussionists include Juggy Rihal of Coventry, [[Aman Hayer]] of [[Leamington Spa]] and Billy Sandher of Gravesend.

==Remixes==
Punjabi folk remixed with hip hop, known lovingly as folkhop, is most often produced when folk vocals are purchased online to be remixed in a studio.
Folk vocals are usually sung to traditional melodies, that are often repeated with new lyrics.  

Many South Asian DJs, especially in America, have mixed Punjabi folk music with house, [[reggae]], and [[hip-hop]] to add a different flavor to Punjabi folk. These remixes continued to gain popularity as the 1990s came to an end.

Of particular note among remix artists is Bally Sagoo, a Punjabi-Sikh, Anglo-Indian raised in [[Birmingham]], England. Sagoo described his music as &quot;a bit of tablas, a bit of the Indian sound. But bring on the bass lines, bring on the funky-drummer beat, bring on the [[James Brown]] samples&quot;, to ''Time'' magazine in 1997. He was recently signed by [[Sony]] as the flagship artist for a new sound. The most popular of these is [[Daler Mehndi]], a Punjabi singer from India, and his music, known as &quot;folk pop&quot;. Mehndi has become a major name not just in Punjab, but also all over India, with tracks such as &quot;Bolo Ta Ra Ra&quot; and &quot;Ho Jayegee Balle Balle&quot;. He has made the sound of bhangra-pop a craze amongst many non-Punjabis in India, selling many millions of albums. Perhaps his most impressive accomplishment is the selling of 250,000 albums in [[Kerala]], a state in the South of India where Punjabi is not spoken.

Toward the end of the decade, bhangra continued to slow down, with folkhop artists such as Bally Sagoo and Apache Indian signing with international recording labels Sony and Island. Moreover, Multitone Records, one of the major recording labels associated with bhangra in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, was bought by BMG. Finally, a recent [[Pepsi]] commercial launched in Britain featured South Asian actors and Punjabi folk music. This, perhaps more than anything else, is a true sign of the emergence of Punjabi folk into popular culture.

==Cultural impact==
The interpretation of bhangra must exist in the space where Asian, UK and hip-hop cultures meet. There is an expressed concern that oversimplification of the genre by outsiders is detrimental to the music's message, but artists are responsible for how they express their music's content as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Sanjay. &quot;'Noisy Asians' or 'Asian Noise?'&quot; In Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of New Asian Dance Music. 32-57.&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Bhangra's Ambassador, Keeping the Party Spinning&quot; from the ''New York Times'', DJ Rekha is conscious of her cultural accountability to her music.

Bhangra followers often feel that the music is an expression of identity. As the movement gains momentum, bhangra music has also gained international recognition.  &quot;Asian fusion is a melding of the sounds of the sub-continent with [[hip-hop]] beats and [[R&amp;B]] influences, and it's no longer destined to be tucked away in the [[World Music]] section of your record store,&quot; says Ashta Mehta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/music/2004/11/asha/asian_music.shtml BBC - Birmingham Music - Bhangra Birmingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In North America===
Punjabi immigrants have encouraged the growth of Punjabi folk music/rural music in the Western Hemisphere instead of bhangra music. The bhangra industry has not grown in North America nearly as much as it has grown in the United Kingdom. Indian Lion, a Canadian folk artist explains why:{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

{{quote|The reasons there's a lot of bands in England is because there's a lot of work in England. In England the tradition that's been going on for years now is that there's weddings happening up and down the country every weekend, and it's part of the culture that they have Bhangra bands come and play, who get paid 1800 quid a shot, you know. Most of the bands are booked up for the next two years. And England is a country where you can wake up in the morning and by lunchtime you can be at the other end of the country, it helps. In Canada it takes 3 days to get to the other side of the country, so there's no circuit there. And it isn't a tradition [in Canada] to have live music at weddings. There are a few bands here that play a few gigs, but nothing major.|Indian Lion}}

However, with the emergence of North American (non bhangra) folk artists such as [[Manmohan Waris]], Jazzy Bains, [[Kamal Heer]], Harbhanjan Maan, Sarabjit Cheema, and Debi Makhsoospuri and the growth of the [[remix]] market,&lt;ref&gt;iLounge.com (2006) [http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/8209/ ''Study: Digital music market sees 'remarkable growth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Michael (2008) [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=michael_katz ''Recycling Copyright: Survival &amp; Growth in the Remix Age''] (pdf-format)&lt;/ref&gt; the future of Punjabi folk music in North America looks good.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 2001, the archenemy of bhangra, Punjabi folk, and its hip-hop form, folkhop, began to exert an influence over US [[R&amp;B]] music, when [[Missy Elliott]] released the folkhop-influenced song &quot;[[Get Ur Freak On]]&quot;. In 2003, [[Punjabi MC]]'s &quot;[[Mundian To Bach Ke]]&quot; (&quot;Beware of the Boys&quot;) was covered by the U.S. rapper [[Jay-Z]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbhangra.com/americanbhangrahistory.php American Bhangra - History of American Bhangra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The great popularity of these two tracks led to an even greater usage of Punjabi folk in American music. Additionally, American rapper [[Pras]] of [[The Fugees]] has recorded tracks with British alternative bhangra band [[Swami (band)|Swami]]. Because the original Punjabi folk beat is different from the commercialized version we see today, the use of bhangra beats shows the complexity and ingenuity of hip-hop in North America and how artists gain inspiration from all different genres of music. The commercialization of Punjabi folk and the way it has traveled around the world speaks to the versatility and longevity of the musical style.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdnvra&quot;/&gt;

Bhangra, the dance, has also expanded into the world of fitness. Fitness instructors like television host Sarina Jain have developed fitness routines based on bhangra dance moves for their workout programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/south_asia/3167232.stm |title= Diwali comes to Manhattan |accessdate=31 December 2008 |last= Tillin |first= Louise |coauthors= |date= 2003-10-06 |work= BBC News |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bhangra Empire]], a bhangra dance group from California, has appeared on ''America's Got Talent'' and in ''Harper's Bazaar''.

==Bhangra dance competitions==
Bhangra competitions have been held in the Punjab for many decades. However, now universities and other organizations have begun to hold annual bhangra dance competitions in many of the main cities of the United States, Canada, and England. At these competitions, young Punjabis, other South Asians, and people with no South Asian background compete for money and trophies. For example, Bruin Bhangra in Los Angeles has become one of the biggest bhangra competitions in the nation. Teams from all over United States and Canada come together to compete and show their talent. Every year, Bruin Bhangra also invites different well-known Punjabi singers. SoCal Bhangra's past list of artists includes RDB, Manak-e, Sukhshinder Shinda, Jassi Sidhu, KS Makhan and Malkit Singh.

Twenty ten was the first year for Elite 8 Bhangra Invitational, in Washington, D.C. This event invited eight of the top teams from North America to showcase their routines and compete for the number one spot.  Virginia Commonwealth University of Richmond, Virginia, was crowned champion.  Sonay Gabroo Punjab De (SGPD) from Toronto, Canada took the title in 2011.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.elite8bhangra.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, unlike in the Punjab, there is less emphasis on traditional songs and more focus on the flow of a mix; an easy example of this is a team such as Da Real Punjabis, which is notorious for mixing traditional bhangra music with hip-hop or rock songs. This synergy of the bhangra dance with other cultures parallels the music's fusion with different genres. University competitions have experienced an explosion in popularity over the last five years and have helped to promote the dance and music in today's mainstream culture.

In the UK, the first ever major bhangra competition, The Bhangra Showdown,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebhangrashowdown.com The Bhangra Showdown Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; was organised by students from [[Imperial College]] London and held on 1 December 2007. The competition was held at Indigo2 in the O2 in [[Greenwich]] and was attended by over 1000 people. Kings College London won the inaugural Bhangra Showdown, followed by Brunel and Imperial College. All proceeds from this show were donated to two charities, [[Wateraid]] and The Child Welfare Trust, and the show looks to continue on an annual basis. The show was held once again on 31 January 2009 at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, with proceeds going to the MND Association and The Child Welfare Trust, and was attended by around 1,500 people. Six universities took part: Imperial, Queen Mary's, Kingston, Brunel, Birmingham and Leicester/DMU. Birmingham came in 3rd place, Imperial came a very close 2nd, and Queen Mary's took 1st place. This was followed by another sell-out show at London Palladium in January 2010, with crowds of around 2400, where Imperial won, followed by Queen Mary and Barts in second place and Brunel in third.
Most recently, the 4th Bhangra Showdown was held at HMV Hammersmith Apollo on Saturday, 5th February, featuring 10 teams (Imperial College, Kings College, UCL &amp; LSE, Manchester, Brunel, Kingston, Birmingham, Queen Mary and Barts, Leicester and St Georges). The number one spot went to Birmingham, followed closely by Imperial in 2nd place. They performed in front of yet another sell-out crowd of 3500.

The largest student-run organization in Pittsburgh was a bhangra competition called Bhangra In The Burgh. Bhangra In The Burgh was organized by students from Carnegie Mellon University and is held yearly, most recently on January 30, 2010, at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial in Oakland.  Over 2100 people attended, and the show was sold out.  All proceeds go to the Children's Home of Pittsburgh.

===Relation to other Indian dance forms===
Bhangra can be related to [[Bihu dance|Assam's Bihu dance]] performed during Bihu festival. [[Magh Bihu]] is associated with farming, as the traditional Assamese society is predominantly dependent on farming. Parallels between bhangra and bihu can be drawn from the fact that the merriments for both of these music forms involve characteristic [[overtones]] with dances along with the enthralling beats of percussive musical instruments. Moreover, both bihu and bhangra involve high-energy dance moves and [[Sequence dance|sequences]] with young dancers in colorful clothing and the folk music played with the dhol. Both music/dance varieties, though having the similar themes, are distinctly different and have their proper origins in the respective regions of Punjab and [[Assam Valley]].

'''Beastie Boys''' are an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] trio from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/beastie-boys-p10/biography&lt;/ref&gt; The group consists of [[Mike D|Mike D (Michael Diamond)]], [[MCA (musician)|MCA (Adam Yauch)]], and [[Ad-Rock|Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz)]].

The Beastie Boys began as [[hardcore punk]] band in 1979, first appearing on the compilation cassette ''[[New York Thrash]]'' before releasing their first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Polly Wog Stew]]'', in 1982. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 release of their [[Experimental hip hop|experimental hip-hop]] 12&quot; ''[[Cooky Puss]]'', they made the transition to [[hip-hop]] in 1984 and a string of successful [[singles (music)|12&quot; singles]] followed by their [[debut album]] ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' in 1986 which received international critical acclaim and commercial success. As of 2010, they have sold 22&amp;nbsp;million albums in the United States and 40&amp;nbsp;million albums worldwide.

They are one of the longest lived hip-hop acts worldwide and continue to enjoy commercial and critical success in 2011, nearly 25 years after the release of their debut album. On September 27, 2007, they were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Honorees&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/hip_hop_honors/2006/honoree_detail.jhtml?honoree=beastieboys | title =The Honorees | format =Biography | work =www.vh1.com | publisher =MTV Networks | year=2006 }} \&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the group released digitally remastered deluxe editions of their albums ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'', ''[[Check Your Head]]'', ''[[Ill Communication]]'' and ''[[Hello Nasty]]''. Their eighth studio album, ''[[Hot Sauce Committee Part Two]]'', was released on May 3, 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN 1156133p1&quot;&gt;[http://music.ign.com/articles/115/1156133p1.html Beastie Boys Announce Hot Sauce Committee Release Date], ''Music News'', IGN.com&lt;/ref&gt;, and received positive reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/hot-sauce-committee-pt-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
===Early years (1979–1983)===
The Beastie Boys came together in 1979 as a hardcore punk band. A teenaged [[Adam Yauch]] had the idea to start a band and approached friends John Blue Berry, [[Kate Schellenbach]], Harald Bakke and [[Mike D|Michael Diamond]] (who were locally known to be musically inclined), asking them to join him. The name &quot;Beastie Boys&quot; was suggested by original guitarist John Berry. The name &quot;Beastie&quot; stands for &quot;Beings Entering Anarchistic States Towards Internal Excellence,&quot; but this was a [[backronym]], as it was decided what the letters stood for after the band's name had been chosen. The band's original line-up consisted of Adam Yauch on [[bass guitar|bass]], Kate Schellenbach on [[drums]], John Berry on [[guitar]], and Michael Diamond on [[vocals]]. Their first gig was at Berry's loft at 100th Street and Broadway on Yauch's 17th birthday.

On Friday, November 13, 1982, the Beastie Boys, consisting of band members, John Berry, Michael Diamond (Mike D), Adam Yauch (MCA) (a.k.a. Nathanial Hornblower), and Kate Schellenbach (later of [[Luscious Jackson]]), played Philip Pucci's birthday for the purposes of his short concert film of the Beastie Boys, &quot;Beastie&quot; [http://www.philippucci.com/shorts/beastie.html Philip Pucci's &quot;Beastie&quot;]. Pucci held the concert in Bard College's Preston Drama Dance Department Theatre. This performance marked the Beastie Boys’ first on screen appearance in a published motion picture. Pucci's concept for “Beastie” was to distribute a mixture of both a half dozen 16mm Bell and Howell Filmo cameras, and 16mm Bolex cameras to audience members and ask that they capture the Beastie Boys performance from the audience’s own point of view while a master sync sound camera filmed from the balcony of the abandoned theater where the performance was held. The opening band for that performance was “The Young and the Useless”, which featured Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) as their lead singer. A one minute clip of &quot;Beastie&quot; was subsequently excerpted and licensed by the Beastie Boys for use in the &quot;Egg Raid on Mojo&quot; segment of the &quot;Skills to Pay the Bills&quot; long form home video released by Capitol Records. “Skills to Pay the Bills” later went on to earn the Recording Industry Association of America’s (R.I.A.A.) gold sales award for selling more than 500,000 copies.

The band quickly earned support slots for [[Bad Brains]], the [[Dead Kennedys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Raul Pollicino |url=http://www.beastiemania.com/gigog/show.php?g=19830706 |title=Gigography |publisher=BeastieMania.com |date=July 6, 1983 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Misfits (band)|Misfits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Raul Pollicino |url=http://www.beastiemania.com/gigog/show.php?g=19820625 |title=Gigography |publisher=BeastieMania.com |date=June 25, 1982 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reagan Youth]] at venues such as [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]], playing at the latter venue on its closing night. That same year, the Beastie Boys recorded the 7&quot; [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Pollywog Stew]]'' at 171A studios, an early recorded example of [[New York hardcore]].

John Berry left the group (later forming Thwig, Big Fat Love, and Bourbon Deluxe) and was replaced by Adam Horovitz of [[The Young and the Useless]] (who had become close friends with the Beastie Boys at this point) in 1982. The band also performed its first [[hip-hop]] track, &quot;[[Cooky Puss]]&quot;, based on a [[prank call]] by the group to [[Carvel (restaurant)|Carvel Ice Cream]]. It became a hit in New York underground dance clubs and night clubs upon its release.

===''Licensed to Ill'' (1984–1987)===
With the success of &quot;Cookie Puss&quot; they began to incorporate rap into their set. They decided to hire a DJ for their live shows, and ended up getting an NYU student named [[Rick Rubin]]. Soon thereafter, Rubin began producing records, formed [[Def Jam Recordings]] and approached the band about producing them for his new label. Around the same time, the band made a more complete switch over from a punk rock outfit to a three-man [[hip hop music|rap]] trio, each adopting their own hip-hop monikers in the vein of [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Melle Mel]] and [[Fab Five Freddy]] (Mike D, MCA and Adrock). They released the 12&quot; EP, ''[[Rock Hard]]'', in 1985; this would be the second record released by Def Jam crediting Rubin as producer. Kate Schellenbach developed creative differences with the band soon after Rubin's arrival; friction with Rubin was a contributing factor. It is believed that Rubin objected to Schellenbach's place in the band - she did not fit the hip-hop image that Rick envisioned. Schellenbach went on to join [[Luscious Jackson]] in 1991.

In 1985, the band opened for [[John Lydon]]'s post-[[Sex Pistols]] band [[Public Image Ltd.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/beastie_boys/1875933653/in/set-72157600129157602/ |title=Fader magazine 2 sur Flickr : partage de photos ! |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as supporting [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on her North American [[The Virgin Tour]]. Later in the year, the group was on the ''Raising Hell'' tour with [[Run DMC]], [[Whodini]], [[LL Cool J]], and the [[Timex Social Club]]. With their exposure on this tour, the track &quot;Hold It Now, Hit It&quot; made ''Billboard'''s national R&amp;B and Dance charts. The track &quot;She's on It&quot; from the ''[[Krush Groove]]'' soundtrack continued in a rap/metal vein while a double A-side 12,&quot; &quot;[[Paul Revere (song)|Paul Revere]]/The New Style,&quot; was  released at the end of the year.

The band recorded ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' in 1986 and released the album at the end of the year. The album was well-received, and was favorably reviewed by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine with the now-famous headline, &quot;Three Idiots Create a Masterpiece.&quot; ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' became the best selling rap album of the 1980s and the first rap album to go #1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, where it stayed for five weeks. It also reached #2 on the Urban album charts. It was Def Jam's fastest selling debut record to date and sold over five million copies. The first single from the album, &quot;[[(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)]]&quot;, ({{audio|Fight for Your Right by the Beastie Boys.ogg|sample}}) reached #7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and the video (directed by Ric Menello) became an MTV staple.

The band took the ''Licensed to Ill'' tour around the world the following year. It was a tour clouded in controversy featuring female members of the crowd dancing in cages and a giant motorized inflatable penis similar to one used by [[The Rolling Stones]] in the 1970s. The tour was troubled by lawsuits and arrests, with the band accused of provoking the crowd. This culminated in their notorious gig at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]], England on May 30, 1987 that erupted into a riot approximately 10 minutes after the Beasties hit the stage and the arrest of [[Adam Horovitz]] by [[Merseyside Police]] on assault charges.

After the success of ''Licensed to Ill'', the Beasties parted ways with Def Jam and ended their relationship with [[Rick Rubin]] to sign with [[Capitol Records]]. ''[[Tougher Than Leather (film)|Tougher Than Leather]]'', the movie made by [[Rick Rubin]] as a [[star vehicle]] for [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]] with appearances by the Beastie Boys when they were still with the label, was subsequently released in 1988. In 1998, a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg album]] entitled ''Original Ill'' was released, featuring original [[Demo (music)|
demos]] of all the tracks from the final version of ''Licensed to Ill'', plus deleted tracks &quot;[[I'm Down]]&quot; (a [[Beatles]] cover) and &quot;The Scenario&quot; (an early example of [[gangster rap]] which was memorably featured in the 1990 [[Christian Slater]] film ''[[Pump Up the Volume (film)|Pump Up the Volume]]'')

===''Paul's Boutique'' and ''Check Your Head'' (1988–1992)===
[[File:Beastie-boys.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The Beastie Boys at Club Citta Kawasaki, Japan &lt;br /&gt;''Check Your Head tour'' Photo: Masao Nakagami, September 16, 1992&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beastiemuseum.com/mag/issue11/tourinfo.html]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The group re-entered the studio in 1988, emerging with a more artistically mature second album, ''[[Paul's Boutique]]''. Produced by the [[Dust Brothers]] and Matt Dike, this extremely [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy opus is still considered one of the strongest works by the Beastie Boys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clayton Purdom |url=http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/4311/beastieboys-paulsboutique-2009 |title=Beastie Boys: Paul's Boutique (20th Anniversary Edition) (Capitol; 1988) &amp;#124; Record Reviews @ |publisher=Cokemachineglow.com |date=February 24, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it #156 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted Nov 1, 2003 12:00&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599020/156_pauls_boutique |title=156) Paul’s Boutique |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=November 1, 2003 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered a landmark in hip hop recordings due to its large array of samples and intricate use of multi-layering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/paul-s-boutique |title=Paul's Boutique: Information and Much More from Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com&lt;! |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released in 1989 by [[Capitol Records]], after the falling out between the group and [[Def Jam]]. It failed to match the sales of ''Licensed to Ill,'' reaching #14 on the Billboard 200 and #10 on the Billboard R&amp;B charts. The lead single, &quot;[[Hey Ladies]]&quot;, reached #36 on the Billboard 100 and #10 on the R&amp;B charts. ''Rolling Stone'' would describe the album as &quot;the ''[[Pet Sounds]]''/''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' of hip hop.&quot; ''Paul's Boutique'' would eventually sell a million albums, despite the initially weak commercial reception. The band digitally remastered and released the album through their own [http://paulsboutique.beastieboys.com/rd/wiki1 website].

The follow-up album, ''[[Check Your Head]]'', was recorded in the band's own &quot;G-Son&quot; studio in [[Atwater Village, California]] and released on its [[Grand Royal]] record label. The band was influenced to play instruments on this album by Dutch group [[Urban Dance Squad]]; with Mike D on drums, Yauch on bass, Horovitz on guitar and Mark Ramos Nishita (&quot;[[Money Mark|Keyboard Money Mark]]&quot;) on keyboards. [[Mario Caldato, Jr.]], who had helped in the production of ''Paul's Boutique'', engineered the record and became a longtime collaborator. ''Check Your Head'' was released in 1992 and went double platinum in the U.S., reaching a peak of #10 on the Billboard 200. The single &quot;So What'cha Want&quot; reached #93 on the Billboard 100 and made both the urban and modern rock charts while the album's first single &quot;[[Pass the Mic]]&quot; became a hit in dance clubs. The album also introduced a more experimental direction, with [[funk]] and [[jazz]] inspired songs including &quot;Lighten Up&quot; and &quot;[[Something's Got to Give (song)|Something's Got to Give.]]&quot; The band returned to their hardcore punk roots for the song &quot;[[Time for Livin']]&quot;, a [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]] [[cover song|cover]].

Beastie Boys signed an eclectic roster of artists to their [[Grand Royal]] label, including [[Luscious Jackson]], [[Sean Lennon]] and promising Australian artist [[Ben Lee]]. The group owned Grand Royal Records until 2001 when it was then sold for financial reasons. Grand Royal's first independent release was Luscious Jackson's album ''[[In Search of Manny]]'' in 1993. Also, in 1993, the band contributed the track &quot;It's The New Style&quot; (with [[DJ Hurricane]]) to the AIDS-Benefit Album [[No Alternative]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

The Beastie Boys also published ''Grand Royal Magazine'', with the first edition in 1993 featuring a cover story on [[Bruce Lee]], artwork by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], and interviews with [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]] MC [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]. The 1995 issue of the magazine contained a memorable piece on the [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]]. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites this as the first published use of the term, along with the lyrics from the Beasties' 1994 song &quot;Mullet Head.&quot; That is why one never heard the term in the 1980s, even though that decade has retroactively been hailed as the mullet's peak in popularity. The OED says that the term was &quot;apparently coined, and certainly popularized, by U.S. hip-hop group the Beastie Boys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andover.edu/library/courseguides/ay2005/SS/Etymology/mulletoed.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grand Royal Magazine'' is also responsible for giving British band [[Sneaker Pimps]] their name.

===''Ill Communication'' (1993–1996)===
''[[Ill Communication]]'', released in 1994, saw the Beastie Boys' return to the top of the charts when the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 &amp; peaked at #2 on the R&amp;B/ hip hop album chart. The single &quot;[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]&quot; ({{audio|Sabotage by the Beastie Boys.ogg|sample}}) became a hit on the [[modern rock]] charts and the music video, directed by [[Spike Jonze]], received extensive play on MTV. &quot;[[Get It Together (Beastie Boys song)|Get It Together]]&quot; reached Top 10 of the Billboard dance charts and also became an urban hit while &quot;Sure Shot&quot; was a dance hit. ''[[Some Old Bullshit]]'', featuring the band's early independent material, made #50 on the Billboard independent charts.

Beastie Boys headlined at [[Lollapalooza]]—an American travelling music festival—in 1994, together with [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. In addition, the band performed three concerts (in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington D.C.) to raise money for the [[Milarepa Fund]] and dedicated the [[royalties]] from &quot;Shambala&quot; and &quot;[[Bodhisattva Vow (song)|Bodhisattva Vow]]&quot; from the ''Ill Communication'' album to the cause. The Milarepa Fund aims to raise awareness of [[Tibet]]an [[human rights]] issues and the exile of [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]]. In 1996, Yauch organized the [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]], a two-day festival at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco that attracted 100,000 people.

In 1995, the popularity of Beastie Boys was underlined when tickets for an arena tour went on sale in the U.S. and sold out within a few minutes. One dollar from each ticket sold went to local charities. The Beastie Boys toured South America and [[Southeast Asia]] for the first time. The band also released [[Aglio e Olio (Album)|''Aglio e Olio'']], a collection of eight songs lasting just 11 minutes harking back to their punk roots, in 1995. ''The In Sound From Way Out!'', a collection of previously released [[jazz]]/[[funk]] instrumentals, was released on Grand Royal in 1996 with the title and artwork a homage to an album by electronic pop music pioneers [[Perrey and Kingsley]].

===''Hello Nasty'' (1997–2001)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2007}}
Beastie Boys returned to New York City in 1997 to produce and record the album ''[[Hello Nasty]]''. The album displayed a substantial shift in musical feel, with the addition of [[Mix Master Mike]], who added to the Beasties' sound with his kinetic DJ style. Released July 14, 1998, ''Hello Nasty'' earned first week sales of 698,527 in the U.S. and went straight to #1 in the U.S., the UK, Germany, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. The album achieved #2 rank in the charts in Canada and Japan, and reached Top Ten chart positions in Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, France and Israel.


Beastie Boys won two [[Grammy Awards of 1999|Grammy Awards in 1999]], receiving the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] for ''Hello Nasty'' as well as the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for &quot;[[Intergalactic (song)|Intergalactic]]&quot; This was the first and, as of 2008, only time that a band had won awards in both rap and alternative categories.

Also at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]] they won the highly coveted Video Vanguard Award for their contribution to music videos. The following year at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]] they also won the award for Best Hip Hop Video for their hit song &quot;Intergalactic.&quot; Beastie Boys used both appearances at the Video Music Awards to make politically-charged speeches of considerable length to the sizable MTV audiences. At the 1998 ceremony, Yauch addressed the issue of Muslim people being stereotyped as terrorists and that most people of the Muslim faith are not terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1998/ |title=MTV Video Music Awards &amp;#124; 1998 &amp;#124; Highlights, Winners, Performers and Photos from the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards |publisher=MTV.com |date=September 10, 1998 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These comments were made in the wake of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|U.S. Embassy bombings]] that had occurred in both [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] only a month earlier. At the 1999 ceremony in the wake of the horror stories that were coming out of [[Woodstock 99]], Adam Horovitz addressed the fact that there had been so many cases of sexual assaults and rapes at the festival and the need for bands and festivals to pay much more attention to the security details at their concerts.

Beastie Boys started an arena tour in 1998. Through [[Ian C. Rogers]], the band made live downloads of their performances available for their fans but were temporarily thwarted when Capitol Records removed them from its website. The Beastie Boys was one of the first bands who made mp3 downloads available on their website; they got a high level of response and public awareness as a result including a published article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' on the band's efforts.

The 1999 Tibetan Freedom Concerts featured shows in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]], Sydney, Tokyo, and [[Amsterdam]]. On September 28, 1999, Beastie Boys joined [[Elvis Costello]] to play &quot;[[Radio Radio]]&quot; on the 25th anniversary season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

Beastie Boys released ''[[The Sounds of Science]]'', a two-CD anthology of their works in 1999. This album reached #19 on the Billboard 200, #18 in Canada, #6 on the Internet sales charts, and #14 on the R&amp;B/Hip Hop charts. The one new song, the single &quot;Alive&quot;, reached #11 on the Billboard's Modern Rock chart.

In the years following the release of ''Hello Nasty'' the group launched their official website which underwent several transformations eventually culminating in one of the most popular recording artist related websites on the internet.

In 2000, Beastie Boys had planned to co-headline the &quot;[[Rhyme and Reason Tour]]&quot; with [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Busta Rhymes]], but the tour was canceled when drummer Mike D suffered a serious injury due to a bicycle accident. The official diagnosis was fifth-degree [[Separated shoulder|acromioclavicular joint dislocation]]; he needed surgery and extensive rehabilitation. By the time he recovered, Rage Against the Machine had disbanded, although they would reunite seven years later.

Under the name &quot;Country Mike,&quot; Mike D recorded an album, ''[[Country Mike's Greatest Hits]]'', and gave it to friends and family for Christmas in 2000. Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz's side project [[BS 2000]] released ''[[Simply Mortified]]'' in 2001.

''[[Hello Nasty]]'' was reissued on September 22, 2009.

===''To the 5 Boroughs'' (2002–2006)===
The band increased its level of political activism after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001]], organizing and headlining the New Yorkers Against Violence Concert in October 2001. Funds from the concert went towards the [[New York Women's Foundation Disaster Relief Fund]] and the [[New York Association for New Americans]] (NYANA).

In 2002, Adam Yauch started building a new studio facility, ''Oscilloscope Laboratories'', in downtown [[Manhattan, New York]] and the band started work on a new album there. The band released a [[protest song]], &quot;In A World Gone Mad&quot;, against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]] as a free download on several websites, including the Milarepa website, the MTV website, [[MoveOn.org]], and [[Win Without War]]. It became the most downloaded track during April 2003. The 19th and 20th Tibetan Freedom Concerts were held in Tokyo and Taipei, Beastie Boys' first Taiwan appearance. Beastie Boys also headlined the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].

Their single, &quot;Ch-Check It Out,&quot; debuted on ''[[The O.C.]]'' in &quot;The Vegas&quot; episode from Season 1 which aired April 28, 2004.

''[[To the 5 Boroughs]]'' was released worldwide on June 15, 2004. It was the first album the Beastie Boys produced themselves and reached #1 on the Billboard album charts, #2 in the UK and Australia, and #3 in Germany. The first single from the album, &quot;[[Ch-Check It Out]]&quot;, reached #1 in Canada and the [[Modern Rock Tracks|US Modern Rock Tracks]], #2 on the world internet download charts, and #3 on a composite world modern rock chart.

The album was the cause of some controversy with allegations that it installed [[spyware]] when inserted into the CD drive of a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene |first=Thomas C |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/23/beastie_boy_cd_virus |title=Beastie Boys CD Virus |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=June 23, 2004 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has denied this allegation, defending that there is no copy protection software on the albums sold in the U.S. and UK. While there is [[Macrovision CDS-200]] copy protection software installed on European copies of the album, this is standard practice for all European releases on [[EMI]]/Capitol Records released in Europe, and it does not install spyware or any form of permanent software.

The band stated in mid-2006 that they were writing material for their next album and would be producing it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Daniell |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2006/08/01/1713379-ca.html |title=CANOE&amp;nbsp;— JAM!

[[File:Beastieboys-sonar07.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The Beastie Boys (left to right) [[Ad-Rock]], [[Mike D]], and [[MCA (musician)|MCA]] performing in [[Barcelona, Spain]] in September 2007.]]
Speaking to British music weekly ''[[NME]]'' (April 26, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/beastie-boys/27933 |title=World exclusive&amp;nbsp;— Beastie Boys name new album &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; NME.COM |publisher=Nme.Com&lt;! |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond revealed that a new album was to be called ''[[The Mix-Up]]''. Despite initial confusion regarding whether the album would have lyrics as opposed to being purely instrumental, the Mic-To-Mic blog reported that [[Capitol Records]] had confirmed it would be strictly instrumental and erroneously reported a release date scheduled for July 10, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mic-to-mic.blogspot.com/2007/04/beastie-boys-mix-up-due-july-10.html |title=Mic to Mic: Beastie Boys &quot;The Mix-Up&quot; due July June&amp;nbsp;10, 26 |publisher=Mic-to-mic.blogspot.com |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The album was eventually released June 26, as originally reported). On May 1, 2007, this was further cemented by an e-mail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastieboys.com/news.php?NewsID=78 |title=Official Beastie Boys Web Site |publisher=BeastieBoys.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; sent to those on the Beastie Boys' mailing list&amp;nbsp;— explicitly stating that the album would be all instrumental:

{{quote|OK, here's our blurb about our new album – it spits hot fire! – hot shit! it's official... it's named ''[[The Mix-Up]]''. g'wan. all instrumental record. &quot;see i knew they were gonna do that!&quot; that's a quote from you. check the track listing and cover below. you love us. don't you?}}

The band subsequently confirmed this in public, playing several tracks from the album at the 2007 [[Virgin Festival]] at [[Pimlico Race Course]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

To support the release, a string of live dates was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastieboys.com/news.php?NewsID=72 |title=Official Beastie Boys Web Site |publisher=BeastieBoys.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on festivals as opposed to a traditional tour, including the likes of [[Sónar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonar.es/portal/eng/home.cfm |title=Sónar. Home |publisher=Sonar.es |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Spain), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (Denmark), [[Hurricane Festival|Hurricane]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurricane Festival]]&lt;/ref&gt;/[[Southside]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Southside Festival]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Germany), [[Bestival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestival.net/ |title=Bestival 2007 |publisher=Bestival.net |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Isle Of Wight]]), [[Electric Picnic]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Electric Picnic]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Ireland) and [[Open'er Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opener.pl/index2_en.html o p e n ' e r f e s t i v a l&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (Poland). Beastie Boys performed at the [[Live Earth concert, London|UK leg]] of [[Live Earth]] July 7, 2007 at [[Wembley Stadium]], London with [[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]], [[So What'cha Want]], [[Intergalactic (song)|Intergalactic]], and [[Sure Shot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liveearth.msn.com/artists/beastieboys |title=Live Earth on MSN: The Concerts For A Climate In Crisis |publisher=Liveearth.msn.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They worked with [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]], a non-profit environmental organization, on their 2007 summer tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbrock.org/site/ |title=R E V E R B |publisher=Reverbrock.org |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beastie Boys were featured on the cover of [[Beyond Race magazine]] for the publication's summer 2007 issue.

They won a Grammy for ''The Mix-Up'' in the &quot;[[Best Pop Instrumental Album]]&quot; category at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2008.

===''Hot Sauce Committee'' (2009–present)===
In February 2009, Yauch revealed their forthcoming new album has taken the band's sound in a &quot;bizarre&quot; new direction, saying &quot;It's a combination of playing and sampling stuff as we're playing, and also sampling pretty obscure records.&quot; The tentative title for the record was ''Tadlock's Glasses'', of which Yauch explained the inspiration behind the title:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We had a bus driver years ago who used to drive Elvis' back up singers. His name was Tadlock and Elvis gave him a pair of glasses which he was very proud of. So for some reason that title – ''Tadlock's Glasses'' – has just been bouncing around.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2009 The Beastie Boys appeared at [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] and performed the new single from the album titled &quot;Too Many Rappers&quot; alongside rapper [[Nas]] who appears on the track. The group would have toured the UK later in the year in support of the new record.&lt;ref name=beastie&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7906287.stm| title =Beasties promise 'strange' record  | work =http://news.bbc.co.uk| publisher = | accessdate =February 23, 2009  | date=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, it was announced during an interview on ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' that the name of their new album would be ''[[Hot Sauce Committee Part Two|Hot Sauce Committee]]'' and was set for release on September 15&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hulu.com/watch/74545/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-mon-may-25-2009 ]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the tracklisting of the album announced through their mailing list on June 23).

Speaking to [[Drowned in Sound]] the Beastie Boys revealed that Part 2 is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anonymous |first=Adam |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137232-boys-will-be-boys--beastie-boys-talk-hot-sauce-committee-pt-1 |title=Boys will be boys: Beastie Boys talk Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 1 / In Depth // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike D]] also hinted it may be released via unusual means:

{{quote|Pt. 2 is pretty much done. Basically we were making ...Pt 1, had too many songs, so we recorded some more songs. Which sounds bizarre but it actually worked out, because it made it clear to us which songs were going to be on ...Pt 1. Then we had this whole other album of songs: ...Pt 2. ...Pt 1's going to be your regular CD in the stores and to download, but ...Pt 2 is going to be released in...we're still figuring it out, but a different way. More of a 2009 style. You could get in the shower one day and, boom, all of a sudden you're showered with MP3s. Or we might send people a seven-inch every few weeks, so you have a whole box set.&lt;ref name=beastie&gt;{{cite web | url =http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137232-boys-will-be-boys--beastie-boys-talk-hot-sauce-committee-pt-1| title =Beastie Boys talk Hot Sauce Committee Part 1  | work =http://drownedinsound.com| publisher = | accessdate =June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

On July 20, Yauch announced on the Beastie Boys' official YouTube channel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20 juli 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7CH3M7cECI |title=Yauch Announcement |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the fan mailing list the cancellation of several tour dates and the postponement of the new album&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/92849/beastie_boys|title=Beastie Boys' MCA diagnosed with cancer&amp;nbsp;— tour/new album pushed back|accessdate=July 22, 2009|date=July 21, 2009|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the discovery of a cancerous tumor in his [[parotid gland]] and a lymph node. The group also had to cancel their co-headlining gig at the [[Osheaga Festival]] in [[Montreal]] as well as a headlining spot at 2009's [[Lollapalooza]].

In late October 2010, the Beastie Boys sent out two emails regarding the status of Hot Sauce Committee Pts. 1 and 2 to their online mailing list. An email dated October 18 read: &quot;Although we regret to inform you that Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 will continue to be delayed indefinitely, Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 will be released on time as originally planned in spring of 2011.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Alex [http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=147&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=50399], &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, October 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, a second email was sent out, reading as follows:

{{quote|In what can only be described as a bizarre coincidence, following an exhaustive re-sequence marathon, Beastie Boys have verified that their new Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 will be composed of the same 16 tracks originally slated for inclusion on Hot Sauce Committee Part 1. The record (part 2 that is) will be released as planned in spring 2011 on Capitol. The tracks originally recorded for Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 (which now are actually back on Part 1) have now apparently been bumped to make room for the former Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 material. Wait, what?

&quot;I know it's weird and confusing, but at least we can say unequivocally that Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 is coming out on time, which is more than I can say about Part 1, and really is all that matters in the end.&quot; says Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch. &quot;We just kept working and working on various sequences for part 2, and after a year and half of spending days on end in the sequencing room trying out every possible combination, it finally became clear that this was the only way to make it work. Strange but true, the final sequence for Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 works best with all its songs replaced by the 16 tracks we originally had lined up in pretty much the same order we had them in for Hot Sauce Committee Part 1. So we've come full circle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

The official release dates were April 27, 2011 for [[Japan]]; April 29 in the [[UK]] and [[Europe]], and May 3, 2011 in the [[US]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2011/02/25/22593021.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The first single for the album is &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; was made available for download on April 11, 2011 as well as a limited edition 7&quot; vinyl single for [[Record Store Day]] five days later with a Passion Pit remix of the track as a b-side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilikemusic.com/music_news/Beastie_Boys_Make_Some_Noise_Clip-12808 |title=Beastie Boys - Make Some Noise Clip |date=March 30, 2011 |publisher=ILikeMusic.com |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was leaked online on April 6 and subsequently made available via their blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.beastieboys.com/post/4394591238/make-some-noise-this-wasnt-really-part-of-the  |title=Make some noise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22nd, the Beastie Boys emailed out the cryptic message ''&quot;This Sat, 10:35 a.m. EST - Just listen, listen, listen to the beat box&quot;''. A day later, they live streamed their album online via beatbox inside Madison Square Garden.

==Influences and legacy==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
Beastie Boys have had four albums reach the top of the ''Billboard'' album charts (''Licensed to Ill'', ''Ill Communication'', ''Hello Nasty'' and ''To The 5 Boroughs'') since 1986. In the November 2004 issue, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named &quot;Sabotage&quot; the 475th song on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time| work = Rolling Stone| publisher = Rolling Stone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In their April 2005 issue, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked them #77 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 100 Greatest Artists of All Time| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher = Rolling Stone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2007, it was announced that Beastie Boys were one of the nine nominees for the 2008 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Inductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurerockhall.com/2008_Nominees.php |title=the 2008 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees |publisher=Future Rock Hall |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial concert in [[Columbus, Georgia]] in 1987 led to the passage of a lewdness ordinance in that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastieboys.com/bbs/archive/index.php/t-63552.html |title=Anti-lewdness ordinance started in Columbus, GA after Beastie Boys show 19 years ago [Archive&amp;#93; – Beastie Boys Message Board |publisher=Beastieboys.com |date=February 19, 2006 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sal Governale]], a comedian on the staff of ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', indicated on air on July 25, 2007, that he was the president of the Beastie Boys fan club in the 1980s on the [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] computer network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs |title=The best of the week nov.&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;– dec. 4 – The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling lawsuit==
In 2003, Beastie Boys were involved in the landmark [[sampling (music)|sampling]] decision, ''Newton v. Diamond''. In that case, a federal judge ruled that the band was not liable for sampling [[James Newton]]'s &quot;Choir&quot; in their track, &quot;Pass the Mic.&quot; The sample used is the six-second flute stab. In short, the Beasties cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song &quot;Choir.&quot; In the decision, the judge found that &quot;when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.   &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://samplinglaw.blogspot.com/2006/11/newton-v-diamond-2003.html Sampling Law (Annex): Newton v.

The '''British Isles''' are a [[archipelago|group of islands]] off the northwest coast of [[continental Europe]] that include the islands of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] and over six thousand smaller isles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;&quot;British Isles,&quot; ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two [[sovereign state]]s located on the islands: the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] (commonly known as the United Kingdom) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (also described as the Republic of Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;The diplomatic and constitutional name of the Irish state is simply ''Ireland''. For disambiguation purposes, ''Republic of Ireland'' is often used although technically not the name of the state but, according to the ''[[Republic of Ireland Act]] 1948'', the state &quot;may be described&quot; as so.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Isles also include three [[Crown Dependencies|dependencies of the British Crown]]: the [[Isle of Man]] and, by tradition, the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]] and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]], although the latter are not physically a part of the [[archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;British Isles: a geographical term for the islands comprising Great Britain and Ireland with all their offshore islands including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of [[Scotland]] and Ireland and are 2,700 [[Mya (unit)|million years old]]. During the [[Silurian]] period the north-western regions [[plate tectonics|collided]] with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass. The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. [[Ben Nevis]] rises to an [[summit (topography)|elevation]] of only {{convert|1344|m}} and [[Lough Neagh]], which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers only {{convert|381|km2|mi2}}. The climate is [[Temperateness|temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|marine]], with mild winters and warm wet summers. The [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by [[temperate rainforest]], although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover.  The region was re-inhabited after the [[last glacial period]] of [[Quaternary glaciation]], by 12,000 BC in Great Britain and 8000 BC in Ireland. At that time, Great Britain was a [[Doggerland|peninsula of the European continent]] from which Ireland had become separated to form an island.

[[Scoti]] (Ireland), [[Pictish]] (northern Britain) and [[Britons (historical)|Brythons]] (southern Britain) tribes inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brythonic-controlled Britain was [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquered by the Roman Empire]] from AD 43. The first [[Anglo-Saxons]] arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominating the bulk of what is now England.&lt;ref&gt;British Have Changed Little Since Ice Age, Gene Study SaysJames Owen for National Geographic News, July 19, 2005 [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0719_050719_britishgene.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viking]] invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change – particularly in England.  The subsequent [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], while control in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]], soon restricted only to [[The Pale]]. The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the [[British Empire]] and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century.  Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919–1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as [[Northern Ireland]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Britain (name)|British Isles naming dispute|Terminology of the British Isles}}

The earliest known references to the islands as a group appeared in the writings of sea-farers from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colony of [[Massalia#Prehistory and classical antiquity|Massalia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[#refFoster2001|Foster]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The original records have been lost; however, later writings that quoted from the [[Massaliote Periplus]] (6th century BC) and [[Pytheas]]'s ''On the Ocean'' ([[circa]] 325–320 BC)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHarley1987|Harley]], p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;/ref&gt; have survived. In the 1st century BC, [[Diodorus]] used the Latin&lt;!-- these look like Greek --&gt; form, Πρεττανια (''Prettania'') from Πρεττανικη (''Prettanike''),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#refAllen2007|Allen]], p.&amp;nbsp;172-174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] used Βρεττανία (''Brettania''), and [[Marcian of Heraclea]], in his ''Periplus maris exteri'', used αἱ Πρεττανικαὶ νῆσοι (''the Prettanic Isles'') to refer to the islands. Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native [[Celtic languages|Celtic-language]] names for the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDavies2000|Davies]], p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the inhabits of the islands of  ''Pretanike'' were called the Πρεττανοι (''[[Priteni]]'' or ''Pretani'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSnyder2003|Snyder]], p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from the &quot;P&quot; of ''Pretannia'' to the &quot;B&quot; of ''[[Britannia]]'' by the Romans occurred during the time of [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSnyder2003|Snyder]], p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical writer, Ptolemy, referred to the larger island as ''Great Britain'' (''Megale Britannia'') and to Ireland as ''Little Britain'' (''Mikra Brettania'') in his work, ''[[Almagest]]'' (147–148 AD). In his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' (c. 150 AD), he gave these islands the names ''[[Albion]]'', ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]]'', and ''Mona'' (the Isle of Man), suggesting these may have been native names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing ''Almagest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freeman  |first=Philip |title=Ireland and the classical world |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2001 |location=Austin, Texas |page=65 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA65 |isbn=0-292-72518-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''Albion'' appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest of Great Britain]], after which ''Britain'' became the more common-place name for the island called Great Britain. ''Great Britain'' would return to use a millennium later, in the Middle Ages. At that time, it was used to distinguish the island of Britain from the peninsula of [[Brittany]], in northern-western France that had been settled by [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], which was confusingly similar to the medieval writers. ''Great Britain'' and ''Britain'' later became synonymous with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The earliest known use of the phrase ''Brytish Iles'' in the English language is dated 1577 in a work by [[John Dee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;John Dee 1577. p. 65&quot;&gt;John Dee, 1577. 1577 J.

[[Image:British-Isles-NW-European-shelf.png|thumb|right|alt=An image showing the geological shelf of the British Isles.|The British Isles in relation to the north-west [[Geography of Europe|European]] [[continental shelf]].]]

The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of [[tectonics|tectonic]] mountain building. These [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] form a complex geology which records a huge and varied span of earth history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Goudie| first=Andrew S.| coauthors=D. Brunsden| title=The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas| year=1994| publisher=Clarendon Press| location=Oxford| page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note was the [[Caledonian Orogeny]] during the [[Ordovician]] Period, c. 488–444 [[Annum|Ma]] and early [[Silurian]] period, when the [[craton]] [[Baltica]] collided with the [[terrane]] [[Avalonia]] to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed roughly the north western half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the [[Variscan orogeny]] in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods, forming the hills of [[Munster]], south-west England, and south Wales. Over the last 500&amp;nbsp;million years the land which forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30°S, crossing the [[equator]] around 370&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Goudie, ''The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas''--&gt;Ibid., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the [[Quaternary Period]], the most recent being the [[Devensian]]. As this ended, the central [[Irish Sea]] was de-glaciated and the [[English Channel]] flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form. Whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea.

The islands' geology is highly complex, though there are large numbers of [[limestone]] and [[chalk]] rocks that formed in the [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] periods. The west coasts of Ireland and northern Great Britain that directly face the Atlantic Ocean are generally characterised by long [[peninsulas]], and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are &quot;smoother&quot;.

There are about [[List of the British Isles by area|136 permanently inhabited islands]] in the group, the largest two being Great Britain and Ireland. Great Britain is to the east and covers 216,777&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (83,698&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;miles), over half of the total landmass of the group. Ireland is to the west and covers 84,406&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (32,589&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;miles). The largest of the other islands are to be found in the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north, [[Anglesey]] and the Isle of Man between Great Britain and Ireland, and the [[Channel Islands]] near the coast of France.

The islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low lying: the lowest point in the islands is [[Holme, Cambridgeshire]] at {{Convert|-2.75|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = BBC News | authorlink = BBC News | title = UK's lowest spot is getting lower|location = England|page = 1|publisher=BBC|date = Friday, 29 November 2002|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2529365.stm|accessdate = 4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Highlands]] in the northern part of Great Britain are mountainous, with [[Ben Nevis]] being the highest point on the islands at {{convert|1343|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Encyclopaedia Britannica online:Ben Nevis | publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica | year = 2010 | url = http://search.eb.com.ipac.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/eb/article-9078533 | accessdate = 5&amp;nbsp;July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mountainous areas include Wales and parts of Ireland, however only seven peaks in these areas reach above {{convert|1000|m|0|abbr=on}}. Lakes on the islands are generally not large, although [[Lough Neagh]] in Northern Ireland is an exception, covering {{Convert|381|km2|mi2}}. The largest freshwater body in Great Britain is [[Loch Lomond]] at {{convert|71.1|km2|0}}. There are a number of major rivers within the British Isles. The river [[River Severn|Severn]] at {{convert|354|km|0|abbr=on}} is the longest in Great Britain and the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] at {{convert|386|km|0|abbr=on}} is the longest in Ireland.
The isles have a [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[marine climate]]. The [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] (&quot;Gulf Stream&quot;) which flows from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the islands' latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mayes| first=Julian| coauthors=Dennis Wheeler| title=Regional Climates of the British Isles| year=1997| publisher=Routledge| location=London| page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winters are cool and wet, with summers mild and also wet. Most Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]] pass to the north of the islands, combined with the general [[Westerlies|westerly circulation]] and interactions with the landmass, this imposes an east-west variation in climate.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Mayes, ''Regional Climates of the British Isles''--&gt;Ibid., pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands enjoy a mild climate and varied [[soils]], giving rise to a diverse pattern of [[vegetation]]. Animal and plant life in the archipelago is similar to that of the northwestern [[European continent]]. However, there are few numbers of [[species]] with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland, for example, is made up of species that migrated from the elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. However, the only window during which this could occur was between the end of [[Pleistocene|the last Ice Age]] (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).

Originally [[forests]] covered all parts of the islands but today only account for about 9% of the land area of Great Britain and 5% of Ireland. These forests were cleared extensively over the past millennium to make way for crop and pasture land. Most forest land in Ireland are maintained by state [[Afforestation|forestation programmes]]. Almost all land outside of urban areas is [[Arable land|farmland]]. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England.  [[Oak]], [[elm]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[beech]] are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, [[pine]] and [[birch]] are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of [[grasses]] and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and [[marsh]]es host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].

Larger animals, such as [[wolf]], bear and [[reindeer]] are today extinct. However, some species such as [[red deer]] are protected. Other small mammals, such as foxes, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently on the islands and another 200 migrate to them. Common types are the [[chaffinch]], [[Common Blackbird|blackbird]], [[sparrow]] and [[starling]], all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[red grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes of the islands, in particular [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[perch]] and [[Esox|pike]]. [[Squalidae|Dogfish]], [[cod]], [[sole (fish)|sole]], [[pollock]] and [[Bass (fish)|bass]] are among the sea fish as well as [[mussels]], crab and [[oysters]] on the coastline. There are more than 21,000 species of insects found on the islands.

Neither Great Britain nor Ireland are inhabited by many [[reptiles]] or [[amphibians]]. Only three [[snakes]] are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | date = | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate = 17 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with [[weasels]], [[European Polecat|polecat]]s, [[wildcats]], most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], the [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and [[common toad]]s also being absent in Ireland. This patterns in true also for birds and insects. However, notable reversals of this theme include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of [[wood lice]], which are native to Ireland but not found on Great Britain.

Domestic animals native to the islands include the [[Connemara pony]], [[Shetland pony]], [[Irish wolfhound]] and several types of cattle and sheep.

==Demographics==
{{See also|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Demography of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Bi-density.png|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km² of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]]. London and Dublin, with respective population densities of 4,761 and 1,288 are shaded blue.]]

The demographics of the British Isles today are characterised by a generally high density of population in England, which accounts for almost 80% of the total population of the islands. In elsewhere on Great Britain and on Ireland, high density of population is limited to areas around, or close to, a few large cities. The largest urban area by far is the [[London metropolitan area]] with 12–14&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants. Other major populations centres include [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] (2.5&amp;nbsp;million), [[West Midlands conurbation]] (2.3&amp;nbsp;million), [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] (2.1&amp;nbsp;million) in England, [[Greater Glasgow]] (1.7&amp;nbsp;million) in Scotland and  [[Greater Dublin Area]] (1.6&amp;nbsp;million) in Ireland.

The population of England rose rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries whereas the populations of Scotland and Wales have shown little increase during the 20th century, with the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951. Ireland for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area (about one third of the total population). However, since the [[Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine, which caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an [[Irish diaspora]] that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.

The linguistic heritage of the British Isles is rich,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Languages of the British Isles Past and Present|isbn=0-233-96666-8|author=WB Lockwood|publisher=Ladysmith|location=British Columbia|year=1975|quote=An introduction to the rich linguistic heritage of Great Britain and Ireland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with twelve [[languages]] from six groups across four branches of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Language family|family]].

[[Image:British Isles Euler diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|Euler diagram of states and government in the British Isles]]

There are two [[sovereign states]] in the isles: Ireland and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called ''the Republic of Ireland'', governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming [[Northern Ireland]]. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply ''the United Kingdom'', which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, the [[Bailiwick of Jersey|Jersey]] and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown Dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.je&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Counties of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and [[Northern Ireland]] in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have &quot;[[Devolution|devolved]]&quot; governments meaning that they have their own parliaments/assemblies and are self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For [[judicial]] purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.

All of the states in the isles are [[parliamentary democracies]] with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[Member of Parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups are required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state for all parts of the isles except for the Republic of Ireland, where the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].

Ireland and the United Kingdom are part of the European Union (EU). The Crown Dependencies are not a part of the European Union but have certain limited privileges and obligations that were negotiated as a part of the UK's accession to the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.je&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union - Isle of Man Government - Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland area  part of the [[Schengen area]], that allow passport-free travel between EU members states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area had existed across the region. In 1997, this area required formal recognition during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union and is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].

Reciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens to full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the other states. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than that required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement arguing that, &quot;the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond], Ministry of Justice: London&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both and the Governments of [[Government of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and the [[Government of Ireland]] also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland.

These arrangements were made following the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]]. Another body established under that agreement, the [[British-Irish Council]], is made up of the major political entities governing the islands. The [[British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body]] ({{lang-ga|Comhlacht Idir-Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na hÉireann}}) predates the British-Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislature. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).

The British-Irish Council does not have executive powers but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British-Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[Communiqué of the British-Irish Council], February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Leading on from developments in the British-Irish Council, the chair of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary, [[Niall Blaney]], has suggested that the body should shadow the British-Irish Council's work.&lt;ref&gt;Martina Purdy, 28 February 2008 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7268911.stm Unionists urged to drop boycott], BBC: London&lt;/ref&gt;

Many civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole. For example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{cite}} The [[RNLI]], the life boats service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering both the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk], The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
{{Main|History of the British Isles}}
At the end of the last [[Pleistocene|ice age]], what are now the British Isles were joined to [[Continental Europe|the European mainland]] as a mass of land extending north west from the modern-day northern coastline of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Ice covered almost all of what is now Ireland and Great Britain with the exception of most of modern-day [[Munster]] and much of what we now call England. Between 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from the mainland, creating also the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.

At the time of the [[Roman Empire]], about two thousand years ago, various tribes were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as [[Scoti|Scots]], the northern part of Great Britain by a people known as [[Picts]] and the southern half by [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]. [[Anglo-Saxons]] arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Scots and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been [[Christianised]], traditionally by the Romano-Brition, [[Saint Patrick]]. As Europe, including Britain descended turmoil following in the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entering a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]], first to Great Britain and then to the continent, founding [[monasteries]] and [[universities]] and were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of the same nature.

[[Viking]] invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, eventually become feudal possession of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the [[Channel Islands]] to this day.  A century later the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Dermot MacMurrough|a provincial king]] and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died the title of [[King of England]] and [[Lord of Ireland]] became entwined in one person.

By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England as from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as &quot;the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]&quot;, thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.

Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new [[Ascendancy]] class which over the next hundred years would obliterated the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new class was Protestant and British the common people were, largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The &quot;[[Glorious Revolution]]&quot; of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.

The Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North American that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one thirds of the globe. Poverty in Ireland remained desperate however and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working class. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second-half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919–1922), with six counties that form [[Northern Ireland]] remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.

The United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |title=Ireland |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in Great Britain. A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Man Booker Prize]] is awarded to authors from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.

Many globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the ''British Isles'', including [[History of golf|golf]], [[History of association football|association football]], [[History of cricket|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and [[darts]], as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is [[association football]]. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands. The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a team made up of players from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] that undertakes tours of the [[southern hemisphere]] rugby playing nations every four years. This team was formerly known as the ''British Isles'' and the ''British Lions'', but has been called the ''British and Irish Lions'' since 2001. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. The four national rugby teams from Great Britain and Ireland play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]] as part of the [[Six Nations Championship]]. Also since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland and Wales have competed together in the [[Magners League]].

The [[Ryder Cup]] in [[golf]] was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland. From 1979 onwards this was expanded to include the whole of Europe.

[[Image:Basque as first language(corrected).JPG|thumb|240px|Family transmission of Basque language (Basque as initial language)]][[Image:Basque Country Location Map.svg|thumb|300px|Location of the Basque-language provinces within Spain and France]]
'''Basque''' ({{lang-eu|Euskara}}, {{IPA-eu|eus̺kaɾa|pron}}) is the ancestral [[language]] of the [[Basque people]], who inhabit the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region spanning an area in northeastern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]]. It is spoken by 25.7% of Basques in all territories (665,800 out of 2,589,600).&lt;ref name=&quot;IVInkesta&quot;/&gt; Of these, 614,000 live in the Spanish part of the Basque country and the remaining 51,800 live in the French part.&lt;ref name=IVInkesta/&gt;

In academic discussions of the distribution of Basque in Spain and France, it is customary to refer to [[Northern Basque Country|three ancient provinces]] in France and four Spanish provinces. Native speakers are concentrated in a contiguous area including parts of the Spanish ''[[Autonomous communities in Spain|Autonomous Communities]]'' of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] (Spanish: ''País Vasco''; Euskara: ''Euskadi'') and [[Navarre]] and in the western half of the French ''[[Department (administrative division)|Département]]'' of [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]. The Autonomous Community of País Vasco/Euskadi is an administrative entity within the binational ethnographic Basque Country incorporating the traditional Spanish provinces of [[Biscay]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and [[Álava]], which retain their existence as politico-administrative divisions.

These provinces and many areas of Navarre are heavily populated by ethnic Basques, but the Euskara language had, at least until the 1990s, all but disappeared from most of Álava, western parts of Biscay and central and southern areas of [[Navarre]]. In southwestern France, the ancient Basque-populated provinces were [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], and [[Soule]]. They and other regions were consolidated into a single ''département'' back in 1790 under the name Basses-Pyrénées, name which persisted until 1970.

A standardized form of the Basque language, called [[Standard Basque|Euskara Batua]], was developed by the [[Euskaltzaindia|Basque Language Academy]] in the late 1960s. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature...), and this is its main use nowadays. This standard Basque is taught and used as a teaching language (as an option, together with standard Spanish) at most educational levels in the Spanish part of the Basque Country, while the intensity, status and funding by state bodies to Basque language instruction varies depending on the area. In France, the Basque language school Seaska and the association for a bilingual (Basque and French) schooling Ikasbi meet a wide range of Basque language educational needs up to the Sixth Form, while often struggling to surmount financial and administrative constraints.

Apart from this standardized version, there are five main Basque dialects: [[Bizkaian]], [[Gipuzkoan]], and [[Upper Navarrese]] in Spain, and [[Navarrese-Lapurdian]] and [[Zuberoan]] (in France). Although they take their names from the mentioned historic provinces, the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries.

==Names of the language==
In Basque, the name of the language is officially ''Euskara'' (alongside various [[Basque dialects#Dialectal_divergence|dialect]] forms). There are currently three etymological theories of the name ''Euskara'' that are taken seriously by linguists and vasconists which are discussed in detail on the [[Basque people#Etymology of the word Basque|Basque people]] page.

In French the language is normally called ''basque'' or, in recent times, ''euskara''. There is a greater variety of Spanish names for the language. Today, it is most commonly referred to as ''el vasco'', ''la lengua vasca'' or ''el euskera''. Both terms, ''vasco'' and ''basque'', are inherited from Latin [[ethnonym]] ''Vascones'' which in turn goes back to the Greek term ουασκωνους (''ouaskōnous''), an ethnonym used by [[Strabo]] in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (23 CE, Book III).&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 ISBN 0-415-13116-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Vascuence'', derived from Latin ''vasconĭce'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=vascuence|title=Diccionario de la lengua española|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; has acquired negative connotations over the centuries and is not well liked amongst Basque speakers generally. Its use is documented at least as far back as the 14th century when a law passed in [[Huesca]] in 1349 stated that ''Item nuyl corridor nonsia usado que faga mercadería ninguna que compre nin venda entre ningunas personas, faulando en algaravia nin en abraych nin en basquenç: et qui lo fara pague por coto XXX sol''—essentially penalizing the use of Arabic, Hebrew or Vascuence (Basque) with a fine of 30 [[French sol|sols]].

==History and classification==
Though geographically surrounded by [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Romance language]]s, Basque is classified as a [[language isolate]]. It is the last remaining [[pre-Indo-European]] language in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask&quot;/&gt; Consequently, its prehistory may not be reconstructible by means of the [[comparative method]] except by applying it to differences between dialects within the language. Little is known of its origins but it is likely that an early form of the Basque language was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages to the area.

Latin inscriptions in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]] preserve a number of words with [[cognates]] in reconstructed [[proto-Basque]], for instance the personal names ''Nescato'' and ''Cison'' (''neskato'' and ''gizon'' mean &quot;young girl&quot; and &quot;man&quot; respectively in modern Basque). This language is generally referred to as [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and is assumed to have been spoken in the area before the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquests in the western [[Pyrenees]]. Some authors even argue that the [[Late Basquisation|language moved westward]] during the [[Late Antiquity]], after the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], into the north part of [[Hispania]] in which [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque is spoken today]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask&quot;/&gt;

Roman neglect of this area allowed Aquitanian to survive while the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] and [[Tartessian language]]s became extinct. Through the long contact with Romance languages, Basque adopted a sizable number of Romance words. Initially the source was Latin, later [[Gascon language|Gascon]] (a branch of [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) in the northeast, [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the southeast and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the southwest.

===Hypotheses on connections with other languages===

The impossibility of linking Basque with its Indo-European neighbors in Europe has inspired many scholars to search for its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many [[pseudoscientific language comparison|pseudoscientific comparisons]], the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts to connect Basque with geographically very distant language families. All hypotheses on the origin of Basque are controversial, and the suggested evidence is not generally accepted by most linguists. Some of these hypothetical connections are as follows:

* [[Iberian language|Iberian]]: another ancient language once spoken in the peninsula, shows several similarities with [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and Basque. However, there is not enough evidence to distinguish areal contacts from genetic relationship. Iberian itself remains [[unclassified language|unclassified]]. Eduardo Orduña Aznar claims to have established correspondences between Basque and Iberian numerals&lt;ref&gt;Orduña 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and noun case markers.
* the [[Ligurian substrate]] hypothesis proposed in the 19th century by d'Arbois de Joubainville, J. Pokorny, P. Kretschmer and several other linguists encompasses the Basco-Iberian hypothesis.
* [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: Linking Basque to [[Kartvelian languages]] is now widely discredited. The hypothesis was inspired by the existence of the ancient [[Caucasian Iberia|Kingdom of Iberia]] farther east in the Mediterranean. According to [[James Patrick Mallory|J.P. Mallory]], in his 1989 book ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans'', the hypothesis was also inspired by a Basque place-name ending in -''adze''.
* [[Northeast Caucasian languages]], such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]], are seen by the French linguist Michel Morvan as more likely candidates for a very distant connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/mt26s.html A Final (?) Response to the Basque Debate in Mother Tongue 1] (John D. Bengston)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dene-Caucasian]] superfamily: Based on the possible Caucasian link, some linguists, for example [[John Bengtson]] and [[Merritt Ruhlen]], have proposed including Basque in the [[Dene-Caucasian]] superfamily of languages, but this proposed superfamily includes languages from North America and Eurasia, and its existence is highly controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask&quot;/&gt;
* [[Vasconic substratum hypothesis]]: This proposal, by the German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]], claims that there is enough toponymical evidence to conclude that Basque is the only survivor of a larger family that once extended throughout most of Europe, and has also left its mark in modern [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanistik.uni-muenchen.de/germanistische_linguistik/TV/Vennemann.htm Theo Vennemann homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Euskara.png|thumb|180px|left|Percentage of fluent speakers of Basque (areas where Basque is not spoken are included within the 0-4% interval).]]

[[Image:Navarra - Mapa densidad euskera 2001.svg|thumb|right|Percentage of people fluent in Basque language in Navarre (2001).]]
The region in which Basque is spoken today has contracted over centuries and is thus smaller than what is known as the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], or ''Euskal Herria'' in Basque. Toponyms show that the Basque language used to be spoken further eastward in the Pyrenees than today. An example is the [[Aran Valley]] (now a [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-speaking part of [[Catalonia]]), for ''(h)aran'' is the Basque word for &quot;valley&quot;. However, the growing influence of [[Latin language|Latin]] began to drive Basque out from the less mountainous portions of the region.

The [[Reconquista]] temporarily counteracted this tendency when the Christian lords called on northern Iberian peoples — Basques, [[Asturia]]ns, and &quot;[[Franks]]&quot; — to colonize the new conquests. The Basque language became the main everyday language, while other languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[French language|French]], or Latin were preferred for the administration and high education.

Basque experienced a rapid decline in Alava and Navarre during the 19th century. However, the rise of [[Basque nationalism]] spurred increased interest in the language as a sign of ethnic identity, and with the establishment of autonomous governments, it has recently made a modest comeback. Basque-language schools have brought the language to areas such as [[Encartaciones]] and the [[Navarrese Ribera]], where it may have disappeared as a native language in the Middle Ages.

===Official status===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
[[Image:Navarra - Zonificacion linguistica.svg|thumb|Official status of the Basque language in Navarre]]
Historically, Latin or Romance languages have been the official languages in this region.
However, Basque was explicitly recognized in some areas. For instance, the [[fuero|local charter]] of the Basque-[[Reconquista|colonized]] [[Ojacastro]] valley (now in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Today Basque holds co-official language status in the Basque regions of Spain: the full [[Autonomous community of Spain|autonomous community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and some parts of [[Navarre]]. Basque has no official standing in the [[Northern Basque Country]] of France and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is allowed (with translation), as Basque is officially recognized on the other side of the border.

The positions of the various existing governments differ with regard to the promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre. Here the &quot;Ley del Vascuence&quot; (&quot;Law of Basque&quot;), seen as contentious by many Basques, divides Navarre into three language areas: Basque-speaking, non-Basque-speaking, and mixed. The support for the language and the linguistic rights of citizens vary depending on which of the three areas you are in.

===Demographics===
[[Image:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumbnail|260px|right|Map showing the historical retreat and expansion of Basque within the context of its linguistic neighbors between the year 1000 and 2000]]
The 2006 sociolinguistic survey of all Basque provinces showed that in 2006 of all people aged 16 and above:&lt;ref name=IVInkesta/&gt;
* in the Basque Autonomous Community, 30.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 18.3% [[Passive speakers (language)|passive speakers]] and 51.5% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in Gipuzkoa (49.1% speakers) and lowest in Álava (14.2%). These results represent an increase on previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16-24 age range (57.5%) vs 25.0% in the 65+ age range.
* in Iparralde, 22.5% were fluent Basque speakers, 8.6% passive speakers and 68.9% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in Labourd and Soule (55.5% speakers) and lowest in the [[Bayonne]]-[[Anglet]]-[[Biarritz]] conurbation (8.8%). These results represent another decrease on previous years (24.8% in 2001 and 26.4 in 1996). The highest percentage of speakers is in the 65+ age range (32.4%). The lowest percentage is found in the 25-34 age range (11.6%) but there is a slight increase in the 16-24 age range (16.1%)
* in Navarre 11.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 7.6% passive speakers and 81.3% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in the so-called Basque Zone in the North (60.1% speakers) and lowest in the non-Basque Zone in the South (1.9%). These results represent a slight increase on previous years (10.3% in 2001, 9.6% in 1996 and 9.5% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16-24 age range (19.1%) vs 9.1% in the 65+ age range.

Taken together, in 2006 out of a total population of 2,589,600 (1,850,500 in the Autonomous Community, 230,200 in the Northern Provinces and 508,900 in Navarre), there were 665,800 who spoke Basque (aged 16 and above). This amounts to 25.7% Basque bilinguals overall, 15.4% passive speakers and 58.9% non-speakers. Compared to the 1991 figures this represents an overall increase from 528,500 (out of a population of 2,371,100 in 1991) to 665,800 (in 2006).&lt;ref name=IVInkesta/&gt;

===Dialects===
{{Main|Basque dialects}}
[[Image:Euskalkiak koldo zuazo 2008.png|thumb|240px|The modern dialects of Basque according to 21st-century dialectology. {{legend|#849D4D|Western (Biscayan)}}{{legend|#CA5655|Central (Gipuzkoan)}}{{legend|#5287C8|(Upper) Navarrese}}{{legend|#D0AA5A|Navarrese-Lapurdian}}{{legend|#C9CA52|Souletin}}{{legend|#9B9D9A|other Basque areas ''ca'' 1850 (Bonaparte)}}]]
The modern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence, sometimes making cross-dialect communication difficult. This is especially true in the case of [[Bizkaian]] and [[Zuberoan]], which are regarded as the most divergent Basque dialects.

Modern Basque dialectology distinguishes five dialects:&lt;ref name=Zuazo2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Biscayan dialect|The Western dialect]]
*[[Gipuzkoan dialect|The central dialect]]
*[[Upper Navarrese dialect|Navarrese]]
*[[Navarrese-Lapurdian]]
*[[Souletin dialect|Souletin]]

These dialects are divided in 11 sub-dialects, their minor varieties being 24.

===Influence on other languages===
{{See also|List of Spanish words of Basque/Iberian origin}}
Although the influence of the neighboring [[Romance languages]] on the Basque language (especially the lexicon, but also to some degree Basque phonology and grammar) has been much more extensive, there has been some feedback from Basque into these languages as well. In particular [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], and to a lesser degree [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have been influenced. In the case of Aragonese and Gascon, this has been through [[Substratum|substrate]] interference following [[language shift]] from [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] or Basque to a Romance language, affecting all levels of the language, including place names around the Pyrenees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title=La toponymie hispanique prérromane et la survivance du basque jusqu'au bas moyen age|journal=IV Congrès International de Sciences Onomastiques|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title=Estudis de toponímia catalana, I|year=1965|publisher=Barcino|isbn=978-84-7226-080-1|pages=153–217 |authorlink=Miscel·lània de toponimia bascoide a Catalunya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title=De toponimia vasca y vasco-románica en los Bajos Pirineos|journal=Fontes linguae vasconum: Studia et documenta|year=1972|issue=12|pages=299–320|issn=0046-435X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohlfs, Gerhard (1980), Le Gascon: études de philologie pyrénéenne.

Although a number of words of alleged Basque origin in the Spanish language are circulated (e.g. ''anchoa'' 'anchovis', ''bizarro'' 'bizarre', ''cachorro'' 'puppy', etc.), most of these have more easily explicable Romance etymologies or not particularly convincing derivations from Basque.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; Ignoring cultural terms, there is one strong [[loanword]] candidate, ''ezker'', long held to be the source of the Pyrennean and [[Iberian Romance]] words for &quot;left (side)&quot; (''izquierdo'', ''esquerdo'', ''esquerre'', ''quer'', ''esquer'').&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corominas&quot;&gt;''izquierdo'' in the ''[[Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico]]'', volume III, [[Joan Corominas]], [[José A. Pascual]], [[Editorial Gredos]], 1989, Madrid, ISBN 84-249-1365-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of initial /r/ in Gascon could arguably be due to a Basque influence but this issue is under-researched.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

The other most commonly claimed substrate influences:
*the [[Old Spanish]] merger of {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/b/}}.
*the simple five vowel system.
*change of initial {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/h/}} and a later zero (e.g. ''fablar'' → ''hablar'', with Old Basque lacking {{IPA|/f/}}).

However, these alleged [[Influences_on_the_Spanish_language#Possible_Basque_influence|influences on Spanish]] have been criticized:
*Old Spanish ''b'' was almost invariably realized as a [[bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/β/}}, making a simple merger between {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/β/}} much more likely. In addition, this shift also took place widely in the Romance world in languages like [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] where it is difficult to argue for Basque [[adstratum]] or [[substratum]] influence.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;
*5-vowel systems are amongst the most common in the world and do not constitute any sort of reliable evidence of adstratum or substratum influences.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;
*There are various issues with the {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} proposal. 1) Spanish did not fully shift {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}}, instead, it has preserved {{IPA|/f/}} before {{IPA|/we/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (cf ''fuerte'', ''frente''). 2) Evidence of Arabic loanwords in Castilian points to {{IPA|/f/}} continuing to exist long after a Basque substrate might have had any effect on Castilian. 3) Basque regularly developed Latin {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/b/}}. 4) The same change also occurs in parts of Sardinia, Italy and the Romance languages of the Balkans where no Basque substrate can be reasonably argued for. Hence the position of Castilian {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} developing due to Basque influences is untenable.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

Beyond these arguments, a number of [[nomadic]] groups of Castile are also said to use or have used Basque words in their jargon, such as the [[gacería]] in [[Segovia (province)|Segovia]], the [[mingaña]], the Galician [[fala dos arxinas]]&lt;ref&gt;Varela Pose, F.J.

====Basque pidgins====
A number of Basque-based or Basque-influenced [[pidgin]]s have existed. In the 16th century, Basque sailors used a [[Basque-Icelandic pidgin]] in their contacts with Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossaria&quot;&gt;Deen 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Basque pidgin arose from contact between Basque whalers and the indigenous inhabitants in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[Strait of Belle Isle]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakker 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

{{Main|Basque grammar}}

Basque is an [[ergative-absolutive language]]. The subject of an [[intransitive verb]] is in the [[absolutive case]] (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]. The subject of the transitive verb is marked differently, with the [[ergative case]] (shown by the suffix ''-k''). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.

The [[auxiliary verb]], which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with any direct object and the indirect object present. Among European languages, this [[polypersonal agreement]] is only found in Basque, some [[languages of the Caucasus]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (all non-Indo-European). The ergative-absolutive alignment is also unique among European languages, but not rare worldwide.

Consider the phrase:

:''{{Audio|martinek1.ogg|Martinek egunkariak erosten dizkit.}}''
:{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| Martin-ek || egunkari-ak || erosten || di-zki-t
|-
| Martin-ERG || newspaper-PL || buy-GER || AUX.(s)he/it/they_OBJ - PL_OBJ - me_IO [(s)he/it_SBJ]
|}
:&quot;Martin buys the newspapers for me.&quot;

''Martin-ek'' is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending ''-k'' (with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-e-''). ''Egunkariak'' has an ''-ak'' ending which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is ''erosten dizkit'', in which ''erosten'' is a kind of gerund (&quot;buying&quot;) and the auxiliary ''dizkit'' means &quot;he/she (does) them for me&quot;. This ''dizkit'' can be split like this:

* ''di-'' is used in the present tense when the verb has a subject (ergative), a direct object (absolutive), and an indirect object, and the object is he/she/it/them.
* ''-zki-'' means the absolutive (in this case the newspapers) is plural, if it were singular there would be no infix; and
* ''-t'' or '-da-' means &quot;to me/for me&quot; (indirect object).
* in this instance there is no suffix after ''-t''. A zero suffix in this position indicates that the ergative (the subject) is third person singular (he/she/it).

The phrase &quot;you buy the newspapers for me&quot; would translate as:

:''{{Audio|Zuekegunkariak.ogg|Zuek egunkariak erosten dizkidazue}}''
:{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| Zu-ek || egunkari-ak || erosten || di-zki-da-zue
|-
| you-ERG || newspaper-PL || buy-GER || AUX.(s)he/it/they_OBJ - PL_OBJ - me_IO - you(pl.)_SBJ
|}

The auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue and means 'you pl. (do) them for me'

*''di-''   = direct object, present tense
*''-zki-'' = direct object is plural
*''-da-''  = indirect object (to me/for me) {-t becomes -da- when not final.}
*''-zue''  = subject (you pl.)

In spoken Basque, the auxiliary verb is never dropped even if it is redundant: &quot;Zuek niri egunkariak erosten dizkidazue&quot;, you pl. buying the newspapers for me. However, the pronouns are almost always dropped: &quot;egunkariak erosten dizkidazue&quot;, the newspapers buying be-them-for-me-you(plural). The pronouns are used only to show emphasis: &quot;egunkariak zuek erosten dizkidazue&quot;, it is you (pl.) who buy the newspapers for me; or &quot;egunkariak niri erosten dizkidazue&quot;, it is me for whom you buy the newspapers.

Modern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Colloquial Basque, however, only uses indicative present, indicative past, and imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a ''nor'' (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori'' (absolutive-dative) paradigm, as in the sentence ''Aititeri txapela erori zaio'' (&quot;The hat fell from grandfather['s head]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ehu.es/grammar/gram42.htm#1.4.2.2.%20%20Potential%20paradigms:%20absolut (Basque) INFLECTION §1.4.2.2. Potential paradigms: absolutive and dative.]&lt;/ref&gt; Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for passive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned, and also has a ''nor-nork'' (absolutive-ergative) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori-nork'' (absolutive-dative-ergative) paradigm. The last would entail the ''dizkidazue'' example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of ''nor-nori-nork'' in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. (This draws on a language universal: *&quot;Yesterday the boss presented the committee me&quot; sounds at least odd, if not incorrect.) The most ubiquitous auxiliary, ''izan,'' can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the main verb.

There are more persons in the singular (5) than in the [[plural]] (3) for synthetic (or filamentous) verbs because of the two familiar persons—[[T-V distinction|informal]] masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun ''hi'' is used for both of them, but where the masculine form of the verb uses a ''-k'', the feminine uses an ''-n.'' This is a property not found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for &quot;listener&quot; (the [[allocutive]]) even if the verb contains no second person constituent. If the situation is one in which the familiar masculine may be used, the form is augmented and modified accordingly; likewise for the familiar feminine.
(''Gizon bat etorri da'', &quot;a man has come&quot;; ''gizon bat etorri duk'', &quot;a man has come [you are a male close friend]&quot;, ''gizon bat etorri dun'', &quot;a man has come [you are a female close friend]&quot;, ''gizon bat etorri duzu'', &quot;a man has come [I talk to you]&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;hitano&quot;&gt;[http://www.hiru.com/es/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aspecto, tiempo y modo] in Spanish, [http://www.hiru.com/eu/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aditzen aspektua, tempusa eta modua] in Basque.&lt;/ref&gt;
Notice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Still, the restriction on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong since all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense with the familiar forms entirely. Note, however, that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it used to be the second person plural, started being used as a singular formal, and then the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.

All the other verbs in Basque are called periphrastic, behaving much like a participle would in English. These have only three forms total, called [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: perfect (various suffixes), habitual&lt;ref name=&quot;ARKing&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Alan R. |year=1994 |title=The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction |pages=393 |publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |isbn=0-874-17155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (suffix ''-t[z]en''), and future/potential (suffix. ''-ko/-go''). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix ''-tu'' in the perfect, adapted from the Latin ''-tus'' suffix. The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.

Within a verb phrase, the periphrastic comes first, followed by the auxiliary.

A Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number. These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again.  It has been estimated that, with two levels of [[recursion]], a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms.&lt;ref&gt;Agirre et al., 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic syntactic construction is [[Subject-Objects-Verb]] (unlike Spanish, French or English where [[Subject-Verb-Object]]s construction is more common). The order of the phrases within a sentence can be changed with thematic purposes, whereas the order of the words within a phrase is usually rigid. As a matter of fact, Basque phrase order is topic-focus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] is stated first, then the [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. In brief, the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. This rule is also applied in questions, for instance, ''What is this?'' can be translated as ''Zer da hau?'' or ''Hau zer da?'', but in both cases the question tag ''zer'' immediately precedes the verb ''da''. This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word ''galdegai'' (focus) is used.

In negative sentences, the order changes. Since the negative particle ''ez'' must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence follows. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: ''Aitak frantsesa ikasten du,'' &quot;Father is learning French,&quot; in the negative becomes ''Aitak ez du frantsesa ikasten,'' in which ''ikasten'' (&quot;learning&quot;) is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.

Basque has a distinction between [[laminal consonant|laminal]] and [[Apical consonant|apical]] articulation for the alveolar fricatives and affricates. In the laminal consonants the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, while in apical ones, it occurs at the tip (apex).  For example, ''zu'' &quot;you&quot; is distinguished from ''su'' &quot;fire&quot;.

The laminal alveolar fricative {{IPA-eu|s̻|}} is made with the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth; its affricate counterpart is {{IPA|[ts̻]}}. These are written with an orthographic ''z'' (''z'', ''tz''). The [[voiceless apicoalveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|/s̺/}}) is written ''s''; the tip of the tongue points toward the upper teeth. The corresponding affricate ({{IPA|/ts̺/}}) is ''ts''. In the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical ''s'' and the alveolar affricate ''tz'' are used. For example, ''etzi'' &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot; is distinguished from ''etsi'' &quot;to give up&quot;; ''atzo'' &quot;yesterday&quot; is distinguished from ''atso'' &quot;old woman&quot;.

Basque also features postalveolar sibilants ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}, written ''x'', and {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, written ''tx''), sounding like English ''sh'' and ''ch''.

There are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and [[motherese]] (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, ''tanta'' &quot;drop&quot; vs. ''ttantta'' {{IPA|/canca/}} &quot;droplet&quot;. A few common words, such as ''txakur'' {{IPA|/tʃakur/}} &quot;dog&quot;, use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: ''zakur'' &quot;big dog&quot;. Many dialects of Basque exhibit a derived palatalization effect in which coronal onset consonants are changed into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the {{IPA|/n/}} in ''egin'' &quot;to act&quot; becomes palatal in southern and western dialects when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added: {{IPA|/eɡina/}} = {{IPA|[eɡiɲa]}} &quot;the action&quot;, {{IPA|/eɡines/}} = {{IPA|[eɡiɲes]}} &quot;doing&quot;.

The sound represented by ''j'' has a variety of realizations according to the regional dialect: {{IPA|[j, ʝ, ɟ, ʒ, ʃ, x]}} (the last one is typical of the Spanish Basque Country).

The vowel system is the same as Spanish for most speakers. It consists of five pure vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}. &lt;!-- It is thought that Spanish took this system from Basque. [References?] --&gt; Speakers of the Zuberoan dialect also have a sixth, front rounded vowel (represented in writing by ''ü'' and pronounced as /y/), as well as a set of contrasting nasalized vowels, indicating a strong influence from [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

Unless they are recent loanwords (e.g., Ruanda (Rwanda), radar...), words cannot begin with the letter ''r'', and when they are borrowed from elsewhere, the initial ''r-'' is changed to ''err-'', more rarely to ''irr-'' (irratia [the radio], irrisa [the rice]. This is similar to how in Spanish, words with ''s''+ consonant (such as &quot;state&quot;) get an initial ''e'' (''estado'').

===Stress and pitch===

Basque features great dialectal variation in [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], from a weak [[pitch accent]] in the central dialects to a marked stress in some outer dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement. Stress is in general not distinctive (and for historical comparisons not very useful); there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms). E.g., ''basóà'' (&quot;the forest&quot;, absolutive case) vs. ''básoà'' (&quot;the glass&quot;, absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish ''vaso''); ''basóàk'' (&quot;the forest&quot;, ergative case) vs. ''básoàk'' (&quot;the glass&quot;, ergative case) vs. ''básoak'' (&quot;the forests&quot; or &quot;the glasses&quot;, absolutive case).

Given its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard [[orthography]] and [[Euskaltzaindia]] (the Academy of the Basque Language) only provides general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a [[Syntagmatic structure|syntagma]], and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.

This scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality which sets its sound apart from the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodical]] patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). Some ''Euskaldun berriak'' (&quot;new Basque-speakers&quot;, i.e., second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, giving rise to a pronunciation that is considered substandard; e.g., pronouncing ''nire ama'' (&quot;my mum&quot;) as ''nire áma'' (- - ´ -), instead of as ''niré amà'' (- ´ - `).

==Vocabulary==
By contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has adopted many words from [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], among others. There is a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Basque phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: ''lore'' (&quot;flower&quot;, from ''florem''), ''errota'' (&quot;mill&quot;, from ''rotam'', &quot;[mill] wheel&quot;), ''gela'' (&quot;room&quot;, from ''cellam'').

==Writing system==
{{Main|Basque alphabet}}
[[Image:Ascain Stèle discoïdale.jpg|thumb|An example of Basque lettering in a funerary stela.]]
Basque is written using the [[Latin alphabet]] including ''[[ñ]]'' and sometimes ''[[ç]]'' and ''[[ü]]''. Basque does not use ''Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy '' for words that have some tradition in this language; nevertheless, the Basque alphabet (established by [[Euskaltzaindia]]) does include them for loanwords:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/arauak/dok/Araua_0017.pdf Basque alphabet]&lt;/ref&gt;
: Aa Bb Cc (and, as a variant, Çç) Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz

The phonetically meaningful [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz'' are treated as double letters.

All letters and digraphs represent unique [[phoneme]]s. The main exception is when ''l'' or ''n'' are preceded by ''i'', that in most dialects palatalizes their sound into /[[ʎ]]/ and /[[ɲ]]/, even if these are not written. Hence, ''[[Ikurriña]]'' can also be written ''Ikurrina'' without changing the sound, while the proper name ''[[Ainhoa]]'' requires the mute ''h'' to break the palatalization of the ''n''.

''H'' is mute in most regions, but in the Northeast is pronounced in many places, the main reason for its existence in the Basque alphabet.
Its acceptance was a matter of contention during the standardization since the speakers of the most extended dialects had to learn where to place these h's, silent for them.

[[Image:Basquefontsample.png|thumb|left|The letters of the alphabet in a Basque style font.]]
In [[Sabino Arana]]'s (1865–1903) orthography, ''ll'' and ''rr'' were replaced with ''[[ĺ]]'' and ''[[ŕ]]'', respectively.

A typically Basque style of lettering is sometimes used for inscriptions.
It derives from the work of stone and wood carvers and is characterized by thick [[serif]]s.
(See Basque fonts available for download in the External Links section.)

===Number system used by millers===
[[Image:Errotarienzenbakiak.jpg|thumb|An example of the number system employed by millers.]]
Basque millers traditionally employed a separate number system of unknown origin.&lt;ref&gt;Aguirre Sorondo ''Tratado de Molinología - Los Molinos de Guipúzcoa'' Eusko Ikaskuntza 1988 ISBN 8486240662&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the symbols are either arranged along a vertical line or horizontally. On the vertical line the single digits and fractions are usually off to one side, usually at the top. When used horizontally, the smallest units are usually on the right and the largest on the left.

The system is, as is the Basque system of counting in general, [[vigesimal]]. Although the system is in theory capable of indicating numbers above 100, most recorded examples do not go above 100 in general. Interestingly, fractions are relatively common, especially 1/2.

The exact systems used vary from area to area but generally follow the same principle with 5 usually being a diagonal line or a curve off the vertical line (a '''V''' shape is used when writing a 5 horizontally). Units of ten are usually a horizontal line through the vertical. The twenties are based on a circle with intersecting lines.

This system is not in general use anymore but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.

Ulvaeus was born in [[Gothenburg]], but as a child he moved with his family to [[Västervik]]. Ulvaeus studied business and law at [[Lund University]] after doing his military service with stand-up comedian Magnus Holmström.

===Career===
Prior to gaining international recognition with ABBA, Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-[[schlager]] band [[Hootenanny Singers]], who had an enormous following in Scandinavia. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the [[Hep Stars]], and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group’s keyboard player, [[Benny Andersson]]. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: &quot;Isn't It Easy To Say&quot;, a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: &quot;A Flower In My Garden&quot;, recorded by Hep Stars, and their first 'real' hit &quot;Ljuva Sextiotal&quot;, for which [[Stig Anderson]] wrote lyrics.  The latter - a cabarét-style ironic song about the 1960s – was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for [[Eurovision|Eurovision Song Contest]], but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva [[Brita Borg]]. Another hit came in 1969 with &quot;Speleman&quot;, also recorded by Hep Stars.

While filming a nostalgic schlager special for television in March 1969, Björn met eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter [[Agnetha Fältskog]]. Benny had himself met his future spouse, 24-year-old jazz and schlager vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], only weeks before.

Björn Ulvaeus continued recording and touring with Hootenanny Singers to great acclaim while working as in-house producer at [[Polar Record Company]] (headed by future manager [[Stig Anderson]]), with Benny as his new partner. The twosome produced records by other artists and continued writing songs together. Polar artist Arne Lamberts Swedish version of &quot;A Flower In My Garden&quot; - &quot;Fröken Blåklint&quot; - was one of Björn &amp; Bennys first in-house productions. In December 1969, they recorded the new song &quot;She's My Kind Of Girl&quot;, which became their first single as a duo.  It was released in March 1970, giving them a minor hit in Sweden (and by chance a top-ten hit in Japan two years later).

The Hootenanny Singers entered [[Svensktoppen]], the Swedish radio charts, in 1970 with &quot;Omkring Tiggarn Från Luossa&quot;, a cover of an old folk-schlager song.  It remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks, a record which endured until 1990; the song was produced by Björn and Benny, and had Ulvaeus's solo vocal and Benny's piano.

After ABBA, Ulvaeus, together with Andersson, created the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]), and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (based on ABBA songs).

Together with Andersson, Ulvaeus was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award]] in the category &quot;Outstanding Music&quot; (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category &quot;Best Orchestrations&quot; (for musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

For the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after [[ABBA]] had won the contest in Brighton, Ulvaeus appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled &quot;Our Last Video&quot;. Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split. In fact, they each filmed their appearances separately.

Ulvaeus also shared with Andersson &quot;The Special International [[Ivor Novello]] Award&quot; from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', &quot;The Music Export Prize&quot; from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 &quot;The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to...&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF).

===Personal life===
On 6 July 1971, Ulvaeus married [[Agnetha Fältskog]]; the marriage resulted in two children: [[Linda Ulvaeus|Linda Elin Ulvaeus]] (born 23 February 1973), and Peter Christian Ulvaeus (born 4 December 1977). In July 1980, Björn and Agnetha divorced, although they both agreed to remain in ABBA. Ulvaeus then married music journalist Lena Kallersjö on 6 January 1981. This marriage produced another two daughters: Emma (born in 1982) and Anna (born in 1986).

Ulvaeus and Kallersjö currently live in [[Stockholm]]. From 1984 to 1990 they resided in the UK, where Ulvaeus founded an IT-business together with his brother.

He is also one of four people (also including [[Per Gessle]]) who own NoteHeads, a Swedish company which publishes the [[Scorewriter|music notation program]] [[Igor Engraver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ulvaeus is a member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]'s Swedish member organisation  [[Humanisterna]], and was awarded their annual prize, ''Hedenius-priset'', in 2006.  Ulvaeus describes himself as a &quot;freethinker,&quot; rather than an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/node/2298 ''International Humanist'' interview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ulvaeus revealed that he suffered from severe long-term memory loss and now no longer remembers many important events in his life.  He now has little memory of some of the critical events in his professional history and has resorted to images of his past and even [[hypnotism]] to try to bring back his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Tax vindication===

The Swedish Tax Board accused Björn Ulvaeus of failing to pay 90 million kronor (US$12.8 million) in back taxes for eight years ending in 2005. They claimed that he &quot;laundered&quot; his music royalty income through institutions in several foreign countries. Ulvaeus paid the taxes as a precautionary measure during the 2½-year dispute. In October 2008, the county administrative court decided the case in Ulvaeus’ favour, ruling that he never owed any of the 90 million kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/abba-star-bjorn-wins-17m-tax-case/2008/10/15/1223750070878.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=ABBA's Bjorn wins $17m tax case | date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b54103_swedens_taxman_after_abbas_ulvaeus_again.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/3672/20060428/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://di.se/Nyheter/?page=/Avdelningar/Artikel.aspx%3Fstat%3D0%26ArticleID%3D2009%255C03%255C16%255C328954%26SectionId%3DEttan%26menusection%3DStartsidan%3BHuvudnyheter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6233761.stm | work=BBC News | title=Abba star 'underpaid' Swedish tax | date=5 January 2007 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Göran Bror &quot;Benny&quot; Andersson''' (born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden on 16 December 1946) is a Swedish musician, composer, a former member of the Swedish musical group [[ABBA]] (1972–1982), and co-composer of the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'', and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]''. He is currently active with his own band [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (BAO!), and was executive producer for the film version of the musical ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]''.

== Early years ==
Andersson was born to 34-year-old construction engineer Gösta Andersson and his 26-year-old wife Laila. His sister Eva-Lis Andersson followed in 1948.

Andersson's musical background comes basically from his father and grandfather; they both enjoyed playing the [[accordion]], and at six, Benny got his own. Father Gösta and grandfather Efraim taught him Swedish [[folk music]], [[traditional music]], and the odd [[schlager]]. Benny recalls the first records he bought were &quot;[[Du Bist Musik (Caterina Valente song)|Du Bist Musik]]&quot; by Italian schlager singer [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Elvis Presley]]'s rendition of &quot;[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]&quot;; this [[smörgåsbord]] of different kinds of music was to influence and follow him through the years.

When Andersson was ten he got his own piano, and taught himself to play. He left school aged 15 and began to perform at youth clubs. This is when he met his first girlfriend Christina Grönvall, with whom he had two children: Peter (born 1963) and Helen (born 1965).

In early 1964, Benny and Christina joined a group with the odd name &quot;Elverkets Spelmanslag&quot; (&quot;The Electricity Board Folk Music Group&quot;), who by no means was a folk music ensemble: the name was a punning reference to their electric instruments. The repertoire was mainly instrumentals, and Benny recalls one of his standout numbers was &quot;[[Baby Elephant Walk]]&quot;. He also wrote his first pieces of songwriting around this time for this band.

In March 1964, &quot;Elverket Spelmanslag&quot; was up against another band in a talent contest, [[The Hep Stars]]. When Benny stepped in as the Hep Stars' keyboardist in October of that year, he knew this was what he wanted to do.

== The Hep Stars years (1964-1969) ==
The Hep Stars got their breakthrough in March 1965 with their massive hit &quot;Cadillac&quot;, eventually becoming the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson consolidated his place as the band's keyboardist and musical driving force as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits &quot;No Response&quot;, &quot;Sunny Girl&quot;, &quot;Wedding&quot;, &quot;Consolation&quot;, &quot;It's Nice To Be Back&quot; and &quot;She Will Love You&quot; amongst others.

== Before ABBA (1969-1972) ==
Andersson met [[Björn Ulvaeus]] in June 1966, and the two started writing songs together, their first being &quot;Isn't It Easy To Say&quot;, eventually recorded by The Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote several songs and submitted &quot;Hej, Clown&quot; for the 1969 [[Melodifestivalen]] - the Swedish [[Eurovision Song Festival]] finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest he met vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], and they soon became a couple. Around the same time his songwriting companion Ulvaeus met vocalist [[Agnetha Fältskog]].

The personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus' songwriting collaboration has led quite naturally to the very close co-operation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Björn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969: &quot;Ljuva Sextiotal&quot; (a hit with Brita Borg) and &quot;Speleman&quot; (a hit for The Hep Stars). As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the girls' voices convinced the songwriters to model their 'group' on the like of [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] acts [[Blue Mink]], [[Middle of the Road (band)|Middle of the Road]] and [[The Sweet]]. Thus, [[ABBA]] came to life.

== The ABBA years (1972-1982)==
{{Main|ABBA}}
The foursome's breakthrough came with winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Sweden with &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot; on 6 April 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson (together with Ulvaeus) wrote music to and produced eight studio albums with the ABBA. The group achieved great success globally and scored a chain of #1 hits.

== After ABBA: &quot;Chess&quot; , &quot;Kristina&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; ==
After ABBA broke up in 1983, Andersson continued writing music with Ulvaeus. Their first project was the [[stage musical]] ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', written with [[Tim Rice]]. The ''Chess'' concept album - with vocals by [[Elaine Paige]], [[Barbara Dickson]], [[Murray Head]] and Swedes [[Tommy Körberg]] and [[Björn Skifs]] - was released in October 1984, selling two million copies worldwide. The Paige/Dickson duet &quot;[[I Know Him So Well]]&quot; became a major #1 hit, and Murray Head's &quot;[[One Night in Bangkok]]&quot; gave Andersson/Ulvaeus a US #3 hit.

''Chess'' was staged in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in May 1986, and ran for almost three years. A [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] staging in April 1988 received disastrous reviews, and closed after just two months.

In 1985, Andersson produced and released an album with brother and sister [[Anders Glenmark|Anders]] and [[Karin Glenmark]], featuring new songs by Andersson/Ulvaeus. The duo named themselves [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], and a second album with more music by Björn and Benny was released in April 1987, containing the big hit &quot;[[Mio My Mio]]&quot;; also to be found on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', for which Andersson co-produced the music.

In 1987, Andersson released his first solo album ''Klinga Mina Klockor'' (&quot;Chime, My Bells&quot;). All the music was written by and performed by himself on accordion, backed by the ''[[Orsa Spelmän]]'' (Orsa Folk Musicians) on fiddles. A second solo album followed: ''November 1989''.

In 1990, Andersson scored a Swedish #1 hit with &quot;Lassie&quot;, sung by female cabaret group [[Ainbusk]], for whom he also wrote the [[Svensktoppen]] hits &quot;Älska Mig&quot; and &quot;Drömmarnas Golv&quot;. He decided to produce an album with [[Josefin Nilsson]] from this quartet, resulting in the 1993 English-language album ''[[Shapes (Josefin Nilsson album)|Shapes]]'', featuring ten new Andersson/Ulvaeus compositions.

In 1992, he wrote the introduction melody for the European football championship, which was organised by Sweden that year.

From the late 1980s, Andersson had worked on an idea for an epic Swedish language musical based on his affection for traditional folk music, and in October 1995, ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' premiered in Sweden. The musical was based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. The musical ran successfully for almost five years, before  closing in June 1999. An English-language version, simply titled ''Kristina'', was staged in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] for two nights in September 2009, yielding a live recording, and at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for one night in April 2010.

Andersson's next project was ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', a musical built around 24 of ABBA's songs, which has become a worldwide box-office blockbuster with versions in several languages currently being played in many countries, including the UK ([[West End theatre|West End]] premiere in April 1999), Canada ([[Royal Alexandra Theatre|Toronto]] premiere in 2000), the USA ([[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] premiere in 2001), and Sweden ([[Swedish language]] premiere in 2005).

For the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after [[ABBA]] had won the contest in Brighton, Benny appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled &quot;Our Last Video&quot;. Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split; however, Frida's appearance was filmed separately.

A film version of ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' premiered on 18 July 2008. In April/May 2007, Andersson worked on the film soundtrack, re-recording the old ABBA songs with musicians from the old ABBA recording sessions. ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia! The Movie]]'' has now become the most successful movie musical of all time and has been named the number one box office smash of 2008, and the biggest-selling DVD ever in the UK.

== Benny Anderssons Orkester ==
[[File:Benny Andersson Orkester.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Benny Andersson Orchestra at a concert in Minnesota in 2006.]]
Andersson currently performs with his own band of 16 musicians, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]];  ''&quot;'''B'''enny '''A'''nderssons '''O'''rkester&quot;'' (&quot;Benny Andersson's orchestra&quot;), utilising the vocal talents of fellow swedes [[Helen Sjöholm]] (from ''Kristina from Duvemåla'') and [[Tommy Körberg]] (of ''Chess'' fame), with lyrics to new material sometimes written by his song-writing partner and best-friend of 40 years, Björn Ulvaeus. BAO has released three albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.

BAO recently achieved a new record in Sweden on the [[Svensktoppen]] chart by staying there for 243 weeks with the song ''Du är min man'' (&quot;You Are My Man&quot;), sung by [[Helen Sjöholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&amp;Artikel=454899 ''Rekord på Svensktoppen''], [[Sveriges Radio]]. Retrieved 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New compositions ==
Andersson composes primarily for his 'band' BAO! and the vocalists Sjöholm and Körberg, but keeps his older material alive through re-visiting it, like the staging of 'Mamma Mia!' and the Swedish version of 'Chess'.
For a compilation album of the [[Glenmark]] duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], Andersson had Björn Ulvaeus write new Swedish lyrics for the re-recording of two old songs; Ulvaeus also wrote new English lyrics to older Swedish language songs for [[opera]] singer [[Anne Sofie Von Otter]] tribute album &quot;I Let The Music Speak&quot;.
Andersson has written the music to songs recorded by [[Anders Ekborg]] (&quot;Han Som Har Vunnit Allt&quot;) and [[Barbara Dickson]] (&quot;The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down&quot;).
The song &quot;Kärlekens Tid&quot;  -performed by Helen Sjöholm with BAO!-  -has also been performed in English by [[opera]] [[baritone]] [[Bryn Terfel]].
English language versions of the songs from [[Kristina från Duvemåla]] (which is in process of being translated) is also prémiered.

BAO! performed at the premiére of [[Mamma Mia!]] in [[Stockholm]] 4 July 2008, and on Swedish television on 5 August.

== Film music ==
Benny Andersson has written music to several films for screen and television; the first attempt in the early 1970s for the obscure Swedish movie ''The Seduction Of Inga'': the film flopped, but the 'Björn &amp; Benny' single &quot;She's My Kind Of Girl&quot; surprised the composers by being released in Japan and becoming a Top 10 hit (the song re-named in Japan as &quot;The Little Girl Of The Cold Wind&quot;).

In 1987, Andersson wrote music and co-produced the soundtrack with Anders Eljas for the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', based on Swedish author [[Astrid Lindgren]]s ''[[Mio, my Mio]]''. The title song became a huge hit in Sweden for [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]].

In 2000, Benny wrote the music for fellow Swede (no relation) [[Roy Andersson]]'s film ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''  (the music later re-recorded, featuring new lyrics, with BAO! with vocals by Helen Sjöholm). He also wrote the theme for Roy Andersson's next film, ''[[You, the Living]]'', from 2007.

Andersson also worked on the film adaptation of ''Mamma Mia!''.

==Awards==
Together with Ulvaeus, Andersson was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] in a category &quot;Outstanding Music&quot; (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category &quot;Best Orchestrations&quot; (for musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. Andersson/Ulvaeus also won a [[Touring Broadway Awards|Touring Broadway Award]] for the musical &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; (best score).

During his post-ABBA career Andersson won four Swedish [[Grammis]] awards, and together with Ulvaeus received the &quot;Special International&quot; [[Ivor Novello]] award from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', twice &quot;The Music Export Prize&quot; from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 &quot;The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to...&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award from the Swedish Music Publishers Association ([[SMFF]]). In 2002, Andersson was given an honorary professorship by the Swedish Government for his &quot;ability to create high-class music reaching people around the world&quot;.

In 2007, he was elected a member of [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]], and in 2008 received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[Stockholm University]] Faculty of Humanities for contributing importantly both to the preservation and the growth of the Swedish folk music tradition.

==Private life==
Andersson was engaged to Christina  Grönvall after she became pregnant by him when he was just 16 years old. In 1963 they had a son, Peter Grönvall and later a daughter, Hélene. They split in 1966 and never married. Christina kept custody of the children as Andersson was then at the peak of his Hep Stars' success. In the 1990s, Peter formed [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]], a group that enjoyed European success with the Abba-like &quot;Highland&quot; and later as Sweden's entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996]].

Andersson was engaged to [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] of ABBA for about nine years. They married in October 1978 but divorced in 1981. He married Swedish TV presenter Mona Nörklit in November 1981, and had a son, Ludvig (born January 1982).  Ludvig has since followed in his father's footsteps in forming his own band, Ella Rouge.

[[Image:Bluetooth.svg|thumb|300px|Bluetooth logo]]
'''Bluetooth''' is a proprietary [[open standard|open]] [[wireless]] technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short wavelength radio transmissions) from fixed and mobile devices, creating [[personal area network]]s (PANs) with high levels of security. Created by telecoms vendor [[Ericsson]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bluetooth traveler|publisher=www.hoovers.com|date=|url=http://www.hoovers.com/business-information/--pageid__13751--/global-hoov-index.xhtml|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to [[RS-232]] data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization.

Bluetooth is managed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]], which has more than 14,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Newton, Harold.  (2007).  ''Newton’s telecom dictionary.''  New York: Flatiron Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIG oversees the development of the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/About/bluetooth_sig.htm |title=Bluetooth.org |publisher=Bluetooth.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be marketed as a Bluetooth device, it must be [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group#Qualification|qualified]] to standards defined by the SIG. A network of patents are required to implement the technology and are only licensed to those qualifying devices; thus the protocol, whilst open, may be regarded as proprietary.

== Name and logo ==

The word Bluetooth is an [[anglicisation|anglicised]] version of the Scandinavian ''Blåtand''/''Blåtann'', the epithet of the tenth-century king [[Harald I of Denmark]] and parts of [[Norway]] who united dissonant Danish tribes into a single kingdom.  The implication is that Bluetooth does the same with communications protocols, uniting them into one universal standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;sysopt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sysopt.com/features/network/article.php/3532506 |title=Bluetooth Technology and Implications
|publisher=SysOpt.com |last=Monson |first=Heidi |date=1999-12-14 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BTooth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/SIG/ |title=About the Bluetooth SIG |publisher=Bluetooth SIG |date= |accessdate=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EETimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.eu/scandinavia/206902019?cid=RSSfeed_eetimesEU_scandinavia |title=How Bluetooth got its name |first=Jim |last=Kardach |publisher= |date=2008-05-03 |accessdate=2009-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bluetooth logo is a [[bind rune]] merging the [[Younger Futhark]] [[runic alphabet|runes]] [[Image:H-rune.gif|10px]]&amp;nbsp;([[Haglaz|Hagall]]) (ᚼ) and [[Image:Runic letter berkanan.svg|6px]]&amp;nbsp;([[Berkanan|Bjarkan]]) (ᛒ), [[Harald I of Denmark|Harald]]'s initials.

== Implementation ==
Bluetooth uses a radio technology called [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]], which chops up the data being sent and transmits chunks of it on up to 79 bands (1&amp;nbsp;MHz each; centered from 2402 to 2480&amp;nbsp;MHz) in the range 2,400-2,483.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (allowing for guard bands). This range is in the globally unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical ([[ISM band|ISM]]) 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz  short-range [[radio frequency]] band.

Originally [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying]] (GFSK) modulation was the only modulation scheme available; subsequently, since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, π/4-[[DQPSK]] and 8DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices.  Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an instantaneous [[data rate units|data rate]] of 1 [[Data rate units|Mbit/s]] is possible.  The term Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) is used to describe π/4-DPSK and 8DPSK schemes, each giving 2 and 3 Mbit/s respectively.  The combination of these (BR and EDR) modes in Bluetooth radio technology is classified as a &quot;BR/EDR radio&quot;.

Bluetooth is a [[Packet based|packet-based protocol]] with a [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave structure]]. One master may communicate with up to 7 slaves in a [[piconet]]; all devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5 µs intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625 µs; two slots make up a slot pair of 1250 µs. In the simple case of single-slot packets the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots; the slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long but in all cases the master transmit will begin in even slots and the slave transmit in odd slots.

Bluetooth provides a secure way to connect and exchange information between devices such as [[fax]]es, [[mobile phone]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[computer printer|printers]], [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers, [[digital camera]]s, and [[video game console]]s.

=== Communication and connection ===

A master Bluetooth device can communicate with up to seven devices in a [[piconet]]. (An ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology) The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master at any time.

At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode). The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion.

The Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a [[scatternet]], in which certain devices serve as bridges, simultaneously playing the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.

Many USB Bluetooth [[adapter (computing)|adapters]] or &quot;dongles&quot; are available, some of which also include an [[IrDA]] adapter. Older (pre-2003) Bluetooth dongles, however, have limited capabilities, offering only the Bluetooth Enumerator and a less-powerful Bluetooth Radio incarnation. Such devices can link computers with Bluetooth with a distance of 100 meters, but they do not offer as many services as modern adapters do.

== Uses ==

Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short range (power-class-dependent, but effective ranges vary in practice; see table below) based on low-cost [[transceiver]] [[integrated circuit|microchips]] in each device.&lt;ref&gt;

Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in visual line of sight of each other, however a ''quasi optical'' wireless path must be viable.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

|}

The effective range varies due to propagation conditions, material coverage, production sample variations, antenna configurations and battery conditions. In most cases the effective range of class 2 devices is extended if they connect to a class 1 transceiver, compared to a pure class 2 network. This is accomplished by the higher sensitivity and transmission power of Class 1 devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amperordirect.com/pc/r-electronic-resource/z-reference-bluetooth-class1-myth.html |title=Class 1 Bluetooth Dongle Test |publisher=Amperordirect.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Bluetooth Core Specification does mandate minimums for range, the range of the technology is application specific and is not limited.  Manufacturers may tune their implementations to the range needed to support individual use cases.

=== Bluetooth profiles ===

{{Main|Bluetooth profile}}
To use Bluetooth wireless technology, a device has to be able to interpret certain Bluetooth profiles, which are definitions of possible applications and specify general behaviors that Bluetooth enabled devices use to communicate with other Bluetooth devices. These profiles include settings to parameterize and to control the communication from start. Adherence to profiles saves the time for transmitting the parameters anew before the bi-directional link becomes effective. There are a wide range of Bluetooth profiles that describe many different types of applications or use cases for devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Technology/Works/Pages/Profiles_Overview.aspx |title=Profiles Overview |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Personal security application on mobile phones for prevention of theft or loss of items.  The protected item has a Bluetooth marker (e.g. a tag) that is in constant communication with the phone. If the connection is broken (the marker is out of range of the phone) then an alarm is raised. This can also be used as a man overboard alarm. A product using this technology has been available since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ohgizmo.com/2009/03/30/tenbu-nio-is-kind-of-like-a-car-alarm-for-your-cellphone/ Tenbu's nio is kind of like a car alarm for your cellphone]&quot;, ''OhGizmo.com'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 in networking ===

Bluetooth and [[Wi-Fi]] have many applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files.

[[Wi-Fi]] is intended for resident equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as [[WLAN]], the wireless local area networks. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for cabling for general [[local area network]] access in work areas.

Bluetooth was intended for non-resident equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as the wireless [[personal area network]] (WPAN). Bluetooth is a replacement for cabling in a variety of personally carried applications in any setting and can also support fixed location applications such as smart energy functionality in the home (thermostats, etc.).

Wi-Fi is a wireless version of a traditional Ethernet network, and requires configuration to set up shared resources, transmit files, and to set up audio links (for example, headsets and hands-free devices). Wi-Fi uses the same radio frequencies as Bluetooth, but with higher power, resulting in a faster connection and better range from the base station. The nearest equivalents in Bluetooth are the [[Bluetooth profile#Dial-up Networking Profile (DUN)|DUN]] profile, which allows devices to act as modem interfaces, and the PAN profile, which allows for ad-hoc networking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Bluetooth exists in many products, such as the [[iPod Touch]], [[Lego Mindstorms NXT]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PSP Go]], telephones, the Nintendo [[Wii]], and some high definition [[Headset (equipment)|headset]]s, [[modem]]s, and watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/Pages/Watch.aspx |title=Watch |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones (i.e., with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with hand-held computers (transferring files).

Bluetooth protocols simplify the discovery and setup of services between devices.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Bluetooth devices can advertise all of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Specification%20Documents/AssignedNumbersServiceDiscovery.pdf |title=Specification Documents |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes using services easier because more of the security, network address and permission configuration can be automated than with many other network types.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

A [[personal computer]] that does not have embedded Bluetooth can be used with a Bluetooth adapter that will enable the PC to communicate with other Bluetooth devices (such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]] and [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]]). While some [[desktop computer]]s and most recent [[laptop]]s come with a built-in Bluetooth radio, others will require an external one in the form of a [[dongle]].

Unlike its predecessor, [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], which requires a separate adapter for each device, Bluetooth allows multiple devices to communicate with a computer over a single adapter.

=== Operating system support ===

{{details|Bluetooth stack}}

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has supported Bluetooth since [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X v10.2]] which was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;

For [[Microsoft]] platforms, [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] and SP3
releases have native support for Bluetooth 1.1, 2.0 and 2.0+EDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/c/5/9c5b2167-8017-4bae-9fde-d599bac8184a/Bth_FAQ.docx |title=Bluetooth Wireless Technology FAQ - 2010 |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Previous versions required users to install their Bluetooth adapter's own drivers, which were not directly supported by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;

Microsoft's own Bluetooth dongles (packaged with their Bluetooth computer devices) have no external drivers and thus require at least Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows Vista RTM/SP1 with the Feature Pack for Wireless or Windows Vista SP2 support Bluetooth 2.1+EDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot;/&gt; Windows 7 supports Bluetooth 2.1+EDR and Extended Inquiry Response (EIR).&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot;/&gt;

The Windows XP and Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stacks support the following Bluetooth profiles natively: PAN, SPP, DUN, HID, HCRP. The Windows XP stack can be replaced by a third party stack which may support more profiles or newer versions of Bluetooth. The Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stack supports vendor-supplied additional profiles without requiring the Microsoft stack to be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot;/&gt;

[[Linux]] has two popular [[Bluetooth stack]]s, [[BlueZ]] and Affix. The BlueZ stack is included with most Linux kernels and was originally developed by [[Qualcomm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluez.org/ |title=Official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack |publisher=BlueZ |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Affix stack was developed by [[Nokia]].
[[FreeBSD]] features Bluetooth support since its 5.0 release.
[[NetBSD]] features Bluetooth support since its 4.0 release.  Its Bluetooth stack has been ported to [[OpenBSD]] as well.

== Mobile phone requirements ==

A Bluetooth-enabled [[mobile phone]] is able to pair with many devices. To ensure the broadest support of feature functionality together with legacy device support, the [[Open Mobile Terminal Platform]] (OMTP) forum has published a recommendations paper, entitled &quot;Bluetooth Local Connectivity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omtp.org/Publications/Display.aspx?Id=8f152a02-4120-4933-a1e5-74c7ad472bc8 OMTP.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications and features ==
=== History ===

The Bluetooth specification was developed as a cable replacement in 1994 by [[Jaap Haartsen]] and Sven Mattisson, who were working for [[Ericsson]] in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;

The specification is based on [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] technology.

The specifications were formalized by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] ([[Special Interest Group|SIG]]). The SIG was formally announced on May 20, 1998. Today it has a membership of over 14,000 companies worldwide. It was established by [[Ericsson]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Nokia]], and later joined by many other companies.

=== Bluetooth v4.0 ===

The Bluetooth SIG completed the Bluetooth Core Specification version 4.0, which includes ''Classic Bluetooth'', ''Bluetooth high speed'' and ''[[Bluetooth low energy]]'' protocols. Bluetooth high speed is based on Wi-Fi, and Classic Bluetooth consists of legacy Bluetooth protocols. This version has been adopted as of June 30, 2010.

Cost-reduced single-mode chips, which will enable highly integrated and compact devices, will feature a lightweight Link Layer providing ultra-low power idle mode operation, simple device discovery, and reliable point-to-multipoint data transfer with advanced power-save and secure encrypted connections at the lowest possible cost. The Link Layer in these controllers will enable Internet connected sensors to schedule Bluetooth low energy traffic between Bluetooth transmissions.

Currently (2011-03) the definition of respective application profiles still are not fulfilled work-items of the standardisation bodies.

==== Bluetooth low energy ====

{{Main|Bluetooth low energy}}

Bluetooth low energy is a subset to Bluetooth V4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack for rapid build-up of simple links. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to V4.0 it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. Chips designs allow for two types of implementation, dual-mode, single-
