{{Main|Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program}}
[[India]] has an active ABM development effort using locally developed and integrated radars, and local missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/aero/story.php?id=2524130  Interview: Vijay Kumar Saraswat Chief Controller of Research and Development, India's DRDO]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, India successfully conducted the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program#Prithvi Air Defense Exercise|PADE (Prithvi Air Defence Exercise)]] in which an Anti-ballistic missile, called the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program#Prithvi Air Defence (PAD)|Prithvi Air Defense (PAD)]] an ''Exoatmospheric'' (outside the atmosphere) interceptor system intercepted a Prithvi-II ballistic missile. The PAD missile has the secondary stage of the Prithvi missile and can reach altitude of {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}}. During the test the target missile was intercepted at an {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mod.nic.in/samachar/dec15-06/h1.htm Prithvi Mission Milestone in Missile Defence].&lt;/ref&gt; India became the fourth nation in the world to acquire such a capability and the third nation to acquire it using in house research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Outlook India. [http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=432771 India develops new anti-missile system].

On March 6, 2009 India successfully tested an interceptor missile that destroyed an incoming missile. A Dhanush missile was launced from a ship about {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. It rose to a height of {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}} and as it began its downward trajectory, the interceptor was launched and successfully achieved a kill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeenews.com/nation/2009-03-07/512897news.html India successfully tests indigenous interceptor missle]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2010 India successfully tested an interceptor missile, bringing down an incoming target ballistic missile (a modified Prithvi) with 2,000&amp;nbsp;km range, at an altitude of 15&amp;nbsp;km over the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article535042.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Interceptor missile hits the bull's eye | date=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On march 6, 2011 India successfully tested an indigenously built interceptor missile, bringing down an incoming target ballistic missile from Wheeler Island off the Orissa coast.The interceptor, developed under the Ballistic Missile Defence System, destroyed the target, a variant of Prithvi-II, mimicking an enemy missile, fired from launch complex-III of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur on-Sea in Balasore district, about 70&amp;nbsp;km from Wheeler Island across the sea, at an altitude of 16&amp;nbsp;km over the Bay of Bengal. The interceptor was fired five minutes after the target was fired.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/news/india-successfully-tests-interceptor-missile-defence-system-news-national-ldgqukccfcg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On may 15,2011 it was reported that India has started working on a network of air-defence systems which would be able to shoot down any enemy missile at a distance of 5,000 kms, before it can enter the Indian air space.According to [[DRDO]] chief,V K Saraswat,missiles are being designed and developed in a manner that would enable them to shoot down any incoming missile at a distance of 5,000 kms..&quot;It is well on schedule and we are already on initial design and testing stage,&quot; Saraswat said.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-developing-interceptor-missile-with-5000-km-range/articleshow/8338225.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development in France===
{{Main|Aster (missile family)}}
On 18 October 2010, France announced a successful tactical ABM test of the [[MBDA Aster|Aster 30]] missile.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATBM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/wp/20101126_samp_t.html |title=SAMP/T Successful on First European Missile Defense Intercept Test |author= |date=26 November 2010 |work= |publisher=Defense Update |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development in Japan ===
[[Image:SM3 from JDS Kongo.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Japan]]ese [[guided missile destroyer]] [[JDS Kongō (DDG-173)|JDS ''Kongō'' (DDG-173)]] firing a [[Standard Missile 3]] anti-ballistic missile.]]
Since 1998, when North Korea launched a [[Taepodong-1]] missile over northern Japan, the Japanese have been jointly developing a new Surface-to-air interceptor known as the Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) with the US. So far tests have been successful, and there are planned 11 locations that the PAC-3 will be installed. A military spokesman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7188698.stm | work=BBC News | title=Japan plans Tokyo missile shield | date=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that tests had been done on two sites, one of them a business park in central Tokyo, and Ichigaya — a site not far from the Imperial Palace.
Along with the PAC-3, Japan has installed a US-developed ship-based anti-ballistic missile system, which was tested successfully on December 18, 2007. The missile was launched from a Japanese warship, in partnership with the US Missile Defense Agency and destroyed a mock target launched from the coast.

=== Development in Republic of China (Taiwan)===
[[Republic of China]], commonly known as [[Taiwan]], is also engaged in the development of an anti-ballistic missile system, based on its indigenously developed Tien Kung-II (Sky Bow) SAM system. Although reports suggest a promising system, the ROC government continues to be interested strongly in the American [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] (THAAD) program.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==History of ABMs==
===1940s and 1950s===
[[Image:NIKE Zeus.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of an [[US Army]] [[Nike Zeus]] missile]]
The idea of destroying rockets before they can hit their target dates from the first use of modern missiles in warfare, the German [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] and [[V-2]] program of [[World War II]]. British fighters attempted to destroy V-1 &quot;buzz bombs&quot; in flight prior to impact, with some success, although concentrated barrages of heavy anti-aircraft artillery had greater success. The V-2, the first true ballistic missile, was impossible to destroy using aircraft or artillery. Instead, the Allies launched [[Operation Crossbow]] to find and destroy V-2s before launch. The operation was largely ineffective, and the V2s were eventually dealt with when the launch sites were overrun by the rapid advance of the Allied armies through Belgium and the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. But defenses against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until 1957, when the Soviet Union demonstrated its advances in intercontinental ballistic missile technology with the launch of [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]], the Earth's first artificial satellite.

In 1958, a topic of research by the U.S. was the test explosions of several low yield [[nuclear weapon]]s at very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic ocean, launched from ships. The devices used were the 1.7 kt boosted fission W25 warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Weapon Archive.org. [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Argus.html Argus].&lt;/ref&gt; 
When such an explosion takes place a burst of [[X-ray]]s are released that strike the Earth's atmosphere, causing secondary showers of charged particles over an area hundreds of miles across. The movement of these charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field causes a powerful [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] which induces very large currents in any conductive material. The purpose was to determine how much the EMP would interfere with radar tracking and other communications and the level of destruction of electronic circuitry aboard missiles and satellites. 
The project's results are not known, although similar so-called 'effects tests' were a regular feature of underground tests at the Nevada Test Site until 1992. These 'effects tests' are used to determine how resistant specific warheads, reentry vehicles (RVs) and other components are to exoatmospheric nuclear explosions.

===Canada===
Other countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at [[DRE Valcartier|CARDE]] in [[Canada]], which researched the main problems of ABM systems. This included developing several advanced [[infrared]] detectors for terminal guidance, a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was [[Gerald Bull]]'s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a [[sabot]] round, which would later be the basis of [[Project HARP]].

===The first operational ABM system - Moscow===
The first real and successful ABM [[hit-to-kill]] test was conducted by the Soviet [[Soviet Anti-Air Defense|PVO]] forces on March 1, 1961. An experimental [[V-1000]] missile (part of the &quot;A&quot; ABM programme) launched from the [[Sary-Shagan]] test range, destroyed a dummy warhead released by a [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] [[ballistic missile]] launched from the [[Kapustin Yar]] cosmodrome. The dummy warhead was destroyed by the impact of 18 thousand [[tungsten-carbide]] spherical [[impactors]] 140 seconds after launch, at an altitude of {{convert|25|km|ft|abbr=on}}. 
The V-1000 missile system was nonetheless considered not reliable enough and abandoned in favor of nuclear-armed ABMs.

The first operational ICBM ABM system was the Soviet [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]], designed to protect [[Moscow]]. It was initially a single-layer exoatmospheric (outside the atmosphere) design, using using [[Galosh (missile)|Galosh interceptors]] (SH-01, also known as ABM-1). It became operational in 1971 and was deployed at four sites around [[Moscow]]. 

A-35 was upgraded during the 1980s to a two-layer system, the [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]]. The Gorgon (SH-11/ABM-4) long-range missile was designed to handle intercepts outside the atmosphere, and the [[53T6|Gazelle (SH-08/ABM-3)]] short-range missile endoatmospheric intercepts that eluded Gorgon. The ABM-3 alone was considered to be technologically equivalent to the United States Safeguard system of 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[GlobalSecurity.org]]. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/abm3.htm -135 anti-ballistic missile system].&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Nike-X of 1960s and plans of Sentinel===

The Soviet initial experiments were closely followed by United States [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]], a modification of then-existing anti-aircraft missiles. Nike Zeus proved unworkable, and so work proceeded with [[Project Nike|Nike X]].

Nike X was a system of two missiles, radars and their associated control systems. The main missile was [[LIM-49 Spartan]]—a Nike Zeus upgraded for longer range and a much larger 5 megatonne warhead intended to destroy enemy's warheads with a burst of x-rays outside the atmosphere. A second shorter-range missile called [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan. Sprint was a very fast missile (some sources claimed it accelerated to 8,000&amp;nbsp;mph (13&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km/h) within 4 seconds of flight—an average acceleration of ''90 [[g]]'') and had a smaller W66 [[Neutron bomb|enhanced radiation]] warhead in the 1-3 kiloton range for in-atmosphere interceptions. 

The new Spartan missile changed the deployment plans. Previously, the Nike systems were to have been clustered near cities as a last-ditch defense, but the Spartan allowed for interceptions at a range of hundreds of miles. The experimental success of Nike X persuaded the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration to propose a thin ABM defense, that could provide almost complete coverage of the United States. In a September 1967 speech, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] referred to it as Sentinel. McNamara, a private ABM opponent because of cost and feasibility (see [[cost-exchange ratio]]), claimed that Sentinel would be directed not against the Soviet Union's missiles (since the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had more than enough missiles to overwhelm any American defense), but rather against the potential nuclear threat of the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

In the meantime a public debate over the merit of ABMs began. Difficulties that had already made an ABM system questionable for defending against an all-out attack. One problem was the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]] (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.

When this proved infeasible for economic reasons, a much smaller deployment using the same systems was proposed, namely Safeguard (described later).

===The problem of defense against MIRVs===
[[Image:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight shot from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]
ABM systems were developed initially to counter single warheads launched from large [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough; since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, the price of the ICBM launching a large warhead should always be greater than the much smaller interceptor missile needed to destroy it. In an arms race the defense would always win.

Conditions changed dramatically in 1970 with the introduction of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]] (MIRV) warheads. Suddenly each launcher was throwing not one warhead, but several. The defense would still require a rocket for every warhead, as they would be re-entering over a wide space and could not be attacked by several warheads from a single antimissile rocket. Suddenly the defense was more expensive than offense; it was much less expensive to add more warheads, or even decoys, than it was to build the interceptor needed to shoot them down.

In summary, the MIRV made ABM economically ineffective, and practically non-workable.

===The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972===
{{main|Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty}}
Technical, economic and political problems described resulted in the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM treaty]] of 1972, which restricted the deployment of strategic (not tactical) anti-ballistic missiles.

By the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision, each country was allowed to deploy a mere 100 ABMs to protect a single, small area. The Soviets retained their Moscow defences. The U.S. designated their ICBM sites at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where Safeguard was already under advanced development.

===Brief use of Safeguard in 1975/1976===
The U.S. [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]] system, which utilized the nuclear-tipped [[LIM-49A Spartan]] and [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missiles, in the short operational period of 1975/1976, was a second counter-ICBMs system in the world. Safeguard protected only the main fields of US ICBMs from attack, theoretically ensuring that an attack could be responded to with a US launch, enforcing the [[mutually assured destruction]] principle.

===SDI experiments in the 1980s===
{{main|Strategic Defense Initiative}}
The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (often referred to as &quot;Star Wars&quot;), along with research into various energy-beam weaponry, brought new interest in the area of ABM technologies. 

SDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations, space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray [[laser]]s were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

Lasers originally developed for the SDI plan are currently in use for astronomical observations. Used to ionize gas in the upper atmosphere, they provide telescope operators with a target to calibrate their instruments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Tactical ABMs deployed in 1990s===
The [[Israel]]i [[Arrow (missile)|Arrow missile]] system was tested initially during 1990, before the [[first Gulf War]]. The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the 1990s.

The [[Patriot missile|Patriot]] antiaircraft missile was the first deployed tactical ABM system, although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi [[Scud]] missiles. Post-war analyses show that the Patriot was much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system's inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the Scud missiles broke up during reentry.

&lt;!--[http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/nmd/index.html FAS] also has a time line for ABM/NMB/TBMD starting in [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missile Defense Milestones]--&gt;
Testing ABM technology continued during the 1990s with mixed success. After the Gulf War, improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems. A new Patriot, [[PAC-3]], was developed and tested—a complete redesign of the PAC-2 deployed during the war, including a totally new missile. 
The improved guidance, radar and missile performance improves the probability of kill over the earlier PAC-2. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Patriot PAC-3s had a nearly 100% success rate against Iraqi TBMs fired. However since no longer range Iraqi Scud missiles were used, PAC-3 effectiveness against those was untested. Patriot was involved in three [[friendly fire]] incidents: two incidents of Patriot shootings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft shooting at a Patriot battery.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board Task Force. [http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-01-Patriot_Report_Summary.pdf Patriot system performance - report summary]. (PDF) January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of the Hawk missile was tested during the early to mid-1990s and by the end of 1998 the majority of US Marine Corps [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] systems were modified to support basic theater anti-ballistic missile capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;FAS. [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/hawk.htm Hawk].&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIM-23 Hawk]] missile is not operational in the U.S. service since 2002, but is used by many other countries.

[[Image:Navy Theater Ballistic Missile Defense.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Developed in the late 1990s, the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile attaches to a modified [[RIM-156 Standard|SM-2 Block IV missile]] used by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]]]
Soon after the Gulf war, the [[Aegis combat system]] was expanded to include ABM capabilities. The [[RIM-156 Standard|Standard missile]] system was also enhanced and tested for ballistic missile interception. During the late 1990s SM-2 block IVA missiles were tested in a theater ballistic missile defense function.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/sm2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[RIM-161 Standard missile 3|Standard Missile 3 (SM-3)]] systems have also been tested for an ABM role. In 2008 an SM-3 missile launched from a [[Ticonderoga-class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class cruiser]], the [[USS Lake Erie (CG-70)|USS Lake Erie]], successfully intercepted a non-functioning satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=DoD Succeeds In Intercepting Non-Functioning Satellite|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11704|date=February 20, 2008|release=No. 0139-08|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Navy Succeeds In Intercepting Non-Functioning Satellite|url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=35114|publisher=U.S. Navy|date=February 20, 2008|release=NNS080220-19|accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 2000 a demonstration system for the US Army [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] was deployed at [[White Sands Missile Range]]. Tests were conducted on a regular basis and resulted in early failures, but successful intercepts occurred during 1999.

===Brilliant Pebbles concept===
Approved for acquisition by the Pentagon during 1991 but never realized, [[Brilliant Pebbles]] was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic system that was meant to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites. 
It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.

The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense.

===Transformation of SDI into MDA, development of NMD/GMD===
While the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, during the early 1990s, President [[George H. W. Bush]] called for a more limited version using rocket-launched interceptors based on the ground at a single site. Such system was developed since 1992, is expected to become operational in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/gmd.html|publisher=MDA|accessdate=8 February 2011|quote=&quot;A total of 30 interceptors are planned for deployment by the end of 2010. &quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and capable of intercepting small number of incoming ICBMs. First called the National Missile Defense (NMD), since 2002 it was renamed [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD). It was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the [[Middle East]]. The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, by ground-based missiles in other locations, or by the [[Boeing YAL-1|Boeing Airborne Laser]]. 

During 1998, Defense secretary [[William Cohen]] proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on intercontinental ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.&lt;ref&gt;PBS. [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]. [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/jan-june99/nmd_1-28a.html A VIABLE DEFENSE?]. January 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of organization, during 1993 SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). In 2002 it was renamed to [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

===US withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002===
On June 13, 2002, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and subsequently recommenced developing missile defense systems that would have formerly been prohibited by the bilateral treaty. This action was done for the ostensible reason of needing to defend against the possibility of a missile attack conducted by a [[rogue state]]. 

The next day, [[Russian Federation]] promptly dropped the [[START II]] agreement, intended to completely ban [[MIRV]]S.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|unit of area measure}}
The '''acre''' is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[area]] in a number of different systems, including the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units#Units of area|U.S. customary]] systems. The most commonly used acres today are the international acre and, in the United States, the survey acre.  The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land.

One acre comprises 4,840 [[square yard]]s, 43,560 [[Square foot|square feet]]&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology [http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf (n.d.) General Tables of Units of Measurement]&lt;/ref&gt; or about {{convert|4050|m2|ha|abbr=none|lk=on|sigfig=3}} (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based on. Originally, an acre was understood as a [[selion]] of land sized at one [[furlong]] (660&amp;nbsp;ft) long and one [[Chain (length)|chain]] (66&amp;nbsp;ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land an [[ox]] could plough in one day.  A [[Square (geometry)|square]] enclosing one acre is approximately {{convert|208|ft|9|in|m|abbr=none}} on a side.  As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any perimeter enclosing 43,560&amp;nbsp;square feet is an acre in size.

The acre is often used to express areas of land. In the [[metric system]], the [[hectare]] is commonly used for the same purpose. An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare.

One acre is 90.75 percent of a {{convert|100|yd|m|2|abbr=none|lk=in}} long by {{convert|53.33|yd|m|abbr=none|lk=in}} wide [[American football field]] (without the [[end zones]]). The full field, including the end zones, covers approximately {{convert|1.32|acres|2|abbr=on}}. It is also approximately 56.68 percent of a {{convert|105|m|ft|2|abbr=none|lk=in}} long by {{convert|68|m|ft|2|abbr=none|lk=in}} wide [[Association football pitch|Association football (soccer) pitch]]. It may also be remembered as 44,000 square feet, less 1%; or as the product of 66 x 660.
[[File:Acre over US and Associationl football field.svg|frame|The area of one acre (red) overlaid on an [[American football]] field (green) and [[Association football]] (soccer) pitch (blue).]]

==International acre==
In 1958, the [[United States]] and countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] defined the length of the international [[yard]] to be 0.9144 [[metre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Standards. (1959). [http://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound].&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4,046.8564224 [[square metre]]s. Since the difference between the U.S. and International acre is only approximately 0.016 square metres (24.8 square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed.

==United States survey acre==
The United States survey acre is approximately 4,046.872 609 874 252 [[square metres]]; its exact value ({{frac|4046|13,525,426|15,499,969}} m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre = 39.37&amp;nbsp;inches exactly, as established by the [[Mendenhall Order]].

==Equivalence to other units of area==
1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:
* 4,046.8564224 [[square metres]]
* 0.40468564224 [[hectare]] (A square with 100 m sides has an area of 1 hectare.)

1 United States survey acre is equal to:
* 4,046.87261 [[square metres]]
* 0.404687261 [[hectare]]

1&amp;nbsp;acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:
* 66 feet × 660 feet (43,560 [[square foot|square feet]])
* 1 chain × 10 chains (1 chain = 66 feet = 22 yards = 4 rods = 100 [[link (unit)|links]])
* 1&amp;nbsp;acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet (a square)
* 4,840 [[square yards]]
* 160 [[Perch (unit)|perches]]. A perch is equal to a square [[Rod (length)|rod]] (1 square rod is 0.00625&amp;nbsp;acre)
* 10 square [[Chain (length)|chains]]
* 4 [[Rood (measurement)|roods]]
* A chain by a furlong (chain 22 yards, furlong 220 yards)
*  1/640 (0.0015625) [[square mile]] (1 square mile is equal to 640&amp;nbsp;acres)

== Historical origin ==
{{Anthropic_Farm_Units}}
The word &quot;acre&quot; is derived from [[Old English]] ''æcer'' originally meaning &quot;open field&quot;, [[cognate]] to west coast Norwegian ''ækre'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''åker'', [[German language|German]] ''acker'', [[Latin]] ''ager'', and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''αγρός'' (''agros'').

The acre was approximately the amount of land tillable by one man behind an [[ox]] in one [[day]]. This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one [[chain (length)|chain]] and one [[furlong]]. A long narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word &quot;furlong&quot; itself derives from the fact that it is ''one [[Plough|furrow]] long''.

Before the enactment of the [[metric system]], many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221 square metres, whereas in [[Germany]] as many variants of &quot;acre&quot; existed as there were German states.

Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England by acts of:
* [[Edward I of England|Edward I]],
* [[Edward III of England|Edward III]],
* [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]],
* [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and
* [[Queen Victoria]] – the British [[Weights and Measures Act]] of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.

Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, [[rood]]s, and [[Perch (unit)|perches]]), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.

==Customary acre==
The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in [[carucate]]s, [[virgate]]s, [[Oxgang|bovates]], nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.

==Other acres==

* '''[[Acre (Scots)|Scottish acre]]''', one of a number of [[obsolete Scottish units of measurement]]
* '''[[Acre (Irish)|Irish acre]]''' = 7,840 square yards
* '''[[Acre (Cheshire)|Cheshire acre]]''' =  10,240 square yards&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Robert. (1886). [http://www.archive.org/details/glossaryofwordsu16holluoft ''A glossary of words used in the County of Chester.''] London: Trübner for the English Dialect Society. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman acre]]''' = 1,260 square metres
* [[God's Acre]] – a synonym for a churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lochindaal.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mb/cgi-bin/styles.cgi/queryDict.html?define=God's%20acre The Collaborative International Dictionary of English.] {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adenosine-5'-triphosphate''' ('''ATP''') is a multifunctional [[nucleotide]] used in [[cell (biology)|cells]] as a [[coenzyme]].

ATP is used as a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] in [[signal transduction]] pathways by [[kinase]]s that [[phosphorylation|phosphorylate]] [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s, as well as by [[adenylate cyclase]], which uses ATP to produce the [[second messenger]] molecule [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic AMP]].

The structure of this molecule consists of a [[purine]] base ([[adenine]]) attached to the 1' carbon atom of a [[pentose]] sugar ([[ribose]]). Three phosphate groups are attached at the 5' carbon atom of the pentose sugar. It is the addition and removal of these phosphate groups that inter-convert ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and AMP. When ATP is used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar is first converted to [[deoxyribose]] by [[ribonucleotide reductase]].

ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lohmann K |title=Über die Pyrophosphatfraktion im Muskel |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=17 |issue=31 |pages=624–5 |month=August |year=1929 |doi=10.1007/BF01506215 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j14381j057n22004/?p=b723410ce93b455583229f1fc3a56f9c&amp;pi=5 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its correct structure was not determined until some years later.

==Physical and chemical properties==
ATP consists of [[adenosine]] — composed of an [[adenine]] ring and a [[ribose]] sugar — and three [[phosphate]] groups (triphosphate). The phosphoryl groups, starting with the group closest to the ribose, are referred to as the alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) phosphates. Consequently, as a nucleotide, it (and its relatives ADP and AMP) is basically a [[monomer]] of [[RNA]]. ATP is highly soluble in water and is quite stable in solutions between pH&amp;nbsp;6.8–7.4, but is rapidly [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] at extreme pH. Consequently, ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Stecher P.G., ed. | year=1968 | title=The Merck Index: an encyclopedia of chemicals and drugs 8th edition |publisher= Merck and Co. Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ATP is an unstable molecule in [[Buffer solution|unbuffered]] water, in which it hydrolyses to [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and phosphate. This is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP are less than the strength of the [[hydrogen bond]]s (hydration bonds), between its products (ADP + phosphate), and water. Thus, if ATP and ADP are in [[chemical equilibrium]] in water, almost all of the ATP will eventually be converted to ADP. A system that is far from equilibrium contains [[Gibbs free energy]], and is capable of doing [[work (thermodynamics)|work]]. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations a thousandfold higher than the concentration of ADP. This displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of ATP in the cell releases a large amount of free energy.&lt;ref name=Nicholls&gt;{{cite book |author=Ferguson, S. J.; Nicholls, David; Ferguson, Stuart |title=Bioenergetics 3 |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego |year=2002 |isbn=0-12-518121-3 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Two [[high-energy phosphate]] bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds) (those that connect adjacent phosphates) in an ATP molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stryer p376&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = JM Berg, JL Tymoczko, L.

Any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy, if the cell maintained their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction.&lt;ref name=Nicholls/&gt; However, as is the case with most polymeric biomolecules, the breakdown of RNA, DNA, and ATP into simpler monomers is driven by both energy-release and entropy-increase considerations, in both standard concentrations, and also those concentrations encountered within the cell.

The standard amount of energy released from hydrolysis of ATP can be calculated from the changes in energy under non-natural (standard) conditions, then correcting to biological concentrations. The net change in heat energy ([[enthalpy]]) at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] of the decomposition of ATP into hydrated ADP and hydrated inorganic phosphate is −20.5&amp;nbsp;[[joule per mole|kJ/mol]], with a change in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of 3.4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gajewski E, Steckler D, Goldberg R | title = Thermodynamics of the hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate to adenosine 5'-diphosphate | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/261/27/12733.pdf |format=PDF| journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 261 | issue = 27 | pages = 12733–7 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3528161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) or pyrophosphate (PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) unit from ATP at [[standard state]] of 1&amp;nbsp;M are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biochemistry |last=Berg |first=Jeremy M. |coauthors=Tymoczko, John L., &amp; Stryer, Lubert |year=2007 |edition=6th |publisher=W.

These values can be used to calculate the change in energy under physiological conditions and the cellular ATP/ADP ratio. However, a more representative value (which takes AMP into consideration) called the [[Energy charge]] is increasingly being employed. The values given for the [[Gibbs free energy]] for this reaction are dependent on a number of factors, including overall ionic strength and the presence of [[alkaline earth metal]] ions such as Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Under typical cellular conditions, ΔG is approximately −57&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol (−14&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stryer, Lubert | title=Biochemistry |edition=5th | location=New York | publisher=W.H.

===Ionization in biological systems===
ATP has multiple ionizable groups with different [[acid dissociation constant]]s. In neutral solution, ATP is ionized and exists mostly as ATP&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, with a small proportion of ATP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Storer&gt;{{cite journal | author = Storer A, Cornish-Bowden A | title = Concentration of MgATP2− and other ions in solution.

==Biosynthesis==
The ATP [[concentration]] inside the cell is typically 1–10 [[molarity|mM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Beis I., and Newsholme E.

&lt;/ref&gt; ATP can be produced by [[redox]] reactions using simple and complex [[sugars]] ([[carbohydrates]]) or [[lipids]] as an energy source. For ATP to be synthesized from complex fuels, they first need to be broken down into their basic components. Carbohydrates are [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] into simple sugars, such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Fats ([[triglyceride]]s) are metabolised to give [[fatty acids]] and [[glycerol]].

The overall process of oxidizing glucose to [[carbon dioxide]] is known as [[cellular respiration]] and can produce about 30 molecules of ATP from a single molecule of glucose.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rich PR |title=The molecular machinery of Keilin's respiratory chain |journal=Biochem.

The majority of this ATP production by a non-[[photosynthetic]] aerobic eukaryote takes place in the [[mitochondria]], which can make up nearly 25% of the total volume of a typical cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Lodish, H, Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J. | title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=5th |publisher=WH Freeman |location=New York |isbn = 9780716743668 | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycolysis===
{{Main|glycolysis}}

In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to [[pyruvate]] via the glycolytic pathway. In most organisms, this process occurs in the [[cytosol]], but in some protozoa such as the [[kinetoplastid]]s, this is carried out in a specialized [[organelle]] called the [[glycosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parsons M | title = Glycosomes: parasites and the divergence of peroxisomal purpose | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 717–24 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15255886 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04203.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycolysis generates a net two molecules of ATP through [[substrate-level phosphorylation|substrate phosphorylation]] catalyzed by two enzymes: [[Phosphoglycerate kinase|PGK]] and [[pyruvate kinase]]. Two molecules of [[NADH]] are also produced, which can be oxidized via the [[electron transport chain]] and result in the generation of additional ATP by [[ATP synthase]]. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the [[Krebs Cycle]].&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book | author=Voet D, Voet JG. | year=2004 | title=Biochemistry |volume=1 |edition=3rd | publisher= Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ. | isbn = 978-0-471-19350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glucose===
{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}

In the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to Acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs Cycle). Every &quot;turn&quot; of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of [[carbon dioxide]], one molecule of the ATP equivalent [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], three molecules of the reduced [[coenzyme]] [[NADH]], and one molecule of the reduced coenzyme [[Flavin group|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Both of these latter molecules are recycled to their oxidized states (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[FAD]], respectively) via the [[electron transport chain]], which generates additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of an NADH molecule results in the synthesis of between 2-3 ATP molecules, and the oxidation of one FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields between 1-2 ATP molecules.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt; The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is needed to recycle the reduced NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to their oxidized states. In the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and FAD.&lt;ref name=Lodish/&gt;

The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[glycerol-phosphate shuttle]]) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A [[transaminase]] converts the oxaloacetate to [[aspartate]] for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=Lodish/&gt;&lt;!--will put the antiporter/full cycle in the shuttle article--&gt;

In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of [[proton]]s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This creates a [[proton motive force]] that is the net effect of a [[pH]] gradient and an [[electric potential]] gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient — that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix — provides the driving force for ATP synthesis by [[ATP synthase]]. This [[enzyme]] contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during ATP synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abrahams J, Leslie A, Lutter R, Walker J | title = Structure at 2.8 A resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria | journal = Nature | volume = 370 | issue = 6491 | pages = 621–8 | year = 1994 |pmid=8065448 | doi = 10.1038/370621a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an [[antiporter]], the [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP translocase, which is an [[integral membrane protein]] used to exchange newly-synthesized ATP in the matrix for [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] in the intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=Brandolin&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahout-Gonzalez C, Nury H, Trézéguet V, Lauquin G, Pebay-Peyroula E, Brandolin G | title = Molecular, functional, and pathological aspects of the mitochondrial [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP carrier | journal = Physiology (Bethesda) | volume = 21 | pages = 242–9 | year = 2006| pmid = 16868313 | doi=10.1152/physiol.00005.2006 | url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/21/4/242 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.

===Beta oxidation===
{{Main|beta-oxidation}}

Fatty acids can also be broken down to [[acetyl-CoA]] by [[beta-oxidation]]. Each round of this cycle reduces the length of the acyl chain by two carbon atoms and produces one NADH and one FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, which are used to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Because NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are energy-rich molecules, dozens of ATP molecules can be generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain. The high energy yield of this process and the compact storage of fat explain why it is the most dense source of dietary [[calorie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ronnett G, Kim E, Landree L, Tu Y | title = Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–35 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15878185 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.04.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anaerobic respiration===
{{Main|anaerobic respiration}}

Anaerobic respiration or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] entails the generation of energy via the process of [[oxidation]] in the absence of [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as an [[electron acceptor]]. In most eukaryotes, glucose is used as both an energy store and an electron donor. The equation for the oxidation of glucose to [[lactic acid]] is:

In prokaryotes, multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration. These include [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]] or carbon dioxide. These processes lead to the ecologically-important processes of [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction and [[acetogenesis]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zumft W | title = Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification | url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/4/533?view=long&amp;pmid=9409151 | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 533–616 | date=1 December 1997| pmid = 9409151 | pmc = 232623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Drake H, Daniel S, Küsel K, Matthies C, Kuhner C, Braus-Stromeyer S | title = Acetogenic bacteria: what are the in situ consequences of their diverse metabolic versatilities? | journal = Biofactors | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–24 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9233536 | doi = 10.1002/biof.5520060103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases===
ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called &quot;replenishment&quot; reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase family,

===ATP production during photosynthesis===
In plants, ATP is synthesized in [[thylakoid membrane]] of the [[chloroplast]] during the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of [[photosynthesis]] in a process called photophosphorylation. Here, light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane. This produces a proton-motive force and this drives the ATP synthase, exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen J | title = Photosynthesis of ATP-electrons, proton pumps, rotors, and poise | journal = Cell | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12176312 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00870-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the [[Calvin cycle]], which produces [[triose]] sugars.

===ATP recycling===
The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mole]]. The majority of ATP is not usually synthesised ''de novo'', but is generated from [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] remains fairly constant.

The energy used by human cells requires the [[hydrolysis]] of 100 to 150&amp;nbsp;moles of ATP daily which is around 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;kg. Typically, a human will use up their body weight of ATP over the course of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Di Carlo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Di Carlo, S. E. and Coliins, H. L. | date= June 1, 2001 | journal= Advan. Physiol. Edu. | volume = 25 | pages= 70–1 | title= Submitting illuminations for review | url= http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/25/2/70 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 1000 to 1500 times during a single day (100 / 0.1 = 1000). ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis.

==Regulation of biosynthesis==
ATP production in an aerobic eukaryotic cell is tightly regulated by [[allosteric]] mechanisms, by [[feedback]] effects, and by the substrate concentration dependence of individual enzymes within the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions.

In glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the biologically active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two possible conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP - the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt; A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose 1,6 and 2,6 biphosphate.&lt;ref name=Voet/&gt;

The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP. [[Citrate]] - the molecule that gives its name to the cycle - is a feedback inhibitor of [[citrate synthase]] and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.&lt;ref name=Voet/&gt;

In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is regulated by the availability of its substrate—the reduced form of [[cytochrome c]]. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}NADH + cyt~c_{ox} + ADP + P_{i} \iff \frac{1}{2}NAD^{+} + cyt~c_{red} + ATP
&lt;/math&gt;
which directly implies this equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{cyt~c_{red}}{cyt~c_{ox}} = \left(\frac{[NADH]}{[NAD]^{+}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{[ADP] [P {i}]}{[ATP]}\right)K_{eq}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or a low ratio of [ADP] [P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity.&lt;ref name=Voet/&gt; An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=Brandolin/&gt;

==Functions in cells==
===Metabolism, synthesis, and active transport===
ATP is consumed in the cell by energy-requiring (endothermic) processes and can be generated by energy-releasing (exothermic) processes. In this way ATP transfers energy between spatially-separate [[metabolism|metabolic reactions]]. ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions. This includes the synthesis of macromolecules, including [[DNA replication|DNA]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|RNA]] (see below), and [[Translation (genetics)|proteins]]. ATP also plays a critical role in the [[active transport|transport]] of macromolecules across cell membranes, e.g. [[exocytosis]] and [[endocytosis]].

===Roles in cell structure and locomotion===
ATP is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the [[cytoskeleton]]. In a related process, ATP is required for the [[Sliding filament mechanism|shortening of actin and myosin filament crossbridges]] required for [[muscle contraction]]. This latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] and [[Respiratory system|respiration]].

===Cell signalling===
====Extracellular signalling====
ATP is also a [[signalling molecule]]. ATP, ADP, or adenosine are recognised by [[purinergic receptors]]. Purinoreceptors might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues (Abbracchio M.P. et al., 2008).

In humans, this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Activity-dependent release of ATP from synapses, axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as P2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fields, R.D. and Burnstock G. | year=2006 | title= Purinergic signalling in neuron-glia interactions | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume= 7 | pages=423–36 | pmid=16715052 |pmc=2062484 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1928 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[P2Y receptors|P2Y]]'' receptors are ''metabotropic'', i.e. [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] and modulate mainly intracellular calcium and sometimes cyclic AMP levels. Though named between P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P2Y&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;, only nine members of the P2Y family have been cloned, and some are only related through weak homology and several (P2Y&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, P2Y&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, P2Y&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, P2Y&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) do not function as receptors that raise cytosolic calcium. The ''[[P2X receptors|P2X]] ionotropic'' receptor subgroup comprises seven members (P2X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) which are ligand-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable ion channels that open when bound to an extracellular purine nucleotide. In contrast to P2 receptors (agonist order ATP &gt; [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] &gt; AMP &gt; ADO), purinergic [[nucleotide]]s like ATP are not strong agonists of P1 receptors which are strongly activated by [[adenosine]] and other [[nucleoside]]s (ADO &gt; AMP &gt; [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] &gt; ATP). P1 receptors have A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 subtypes (&quot;A&quot; as a remnant of old nomenclature of ''adenosine receptor''), all of which are G protein-coupled receptors, A1 and A3 being coupled to Gi, and A2a and A2b being coupled to Gs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Fredholm, BB, Abbracchio, MP, Burnstock, G, Daly, JW, Harden, TK, Jacobson, KA, Leff, P, Williams, M | title=Nomenclature and classification of purinoceptors | journal= Pharmacol Rev | date=  June 1, 1994 | volume=46 | pages= 143–156 | pmid= 7938164 | url= http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/46/2/143| issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--This is an awful lot of detail on the receptors without a lot of information on the function of the receptors and their importance--&gt;
All adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or  synergistic to the actions of ATP. In the CNS, adenosine has multiple functions, such as modulation of neural development, neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems (Abbracchio M.P. et al., 2008).

====Intracellular signalling====
ATP is critical in [[signal transduction]] processes. It is used by [[kinase]]s as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions. Kinase activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction. [[Phosphorylation]] of a protein by a kinase can activate this cascade such as the [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] cascade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mishra N, Tuteja R, Tuteja N | title = Signaling through MAP kinase networks in plants | journal = Arch Biochem Biophys | volume = 452 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–68 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16806044 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2006.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP is also used by [[adenylate cyclase]] and is transformed to the [[second messenger]] molecule cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kamenetsky M, Middelhaufe S, Bank E, Levin L, Buck J, Steegborn C | title = Molecular details of cAMP generation in mammalian cells: a tale of two systems | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 362 | issue = 4 | pages = 623–39 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16934836 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.07.045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hanoune J, Defer N | title = Regulation and role of adenylyl cyclase isoforms | journal = Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol | volume = 41 | pages = 145–74 | year = 2001| pmid = 11264454 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.41.1.145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA and RNA synthesis===
In all known organisms, the deoxyribonucleotides that make up [[DNA]] are synthesized by the action of [[ribonucleotide reductase]] (RNR) enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides.&lt;ref name=Stubbe&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stubbe J | title = Ribonucleotide reductases: amazing and confusing | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/265/10/5329 | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 265 | issue = 10 | pages = 5329–32 | date=5 April 1990| pmid = 2180924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes reduce the sugar residue from [[ribose]] to [[deoxyribose]] by removing oxygen from the 2' [[hydroxyl]] group; the substrates are ribonucleoside diphosphates and the products deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (the latter are denoted dADP, dCDP, dGDP, and dUDP respectively.) All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common [[sulfhydryl]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] mechanism reliant on reactive [[cysteine]] residues that oxidize to form [[disulfide bond]]s in the course of the reaction.&lt;ref name=Stubbe/&gt; RNR enzymes are recycled by reaction with [[thioredoxin]] or [[glutaredoxin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt;

The regulation of RNR and related enzymes maintains a balance of dNTPs relative to each other and relative to NTPs in the cell. Very low dNTP concentration inhibits [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]] and [[DNA repair]] and is lethal to the cell, while an abnormal ratio of dNTPs is [[mutagen]]ic due to the increased likelihood of the [[DNA polymerase]] incorporating the wrong dNTP during DNA synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt; Regulation of or differential specificity of RNR has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dNTP pools under cellular stress such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimploy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chimploy K, Tassotto M, Mathews C | title = Ribonucleotide reductase, a possible agent in deoxyribonucleotide pool asymmetries induced by hypoxia | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/275/50/39267
 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M006233200 | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 275 | issue = 50 | pages = 39267–71 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11006282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the synthesis of the [[nucleic acid]] [[RNA]], ATP is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by [[RNA polymerase]]s. The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate (two phosphate groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce CM, Steitz TA |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=177 |issue=22 |pages=6321–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405 |pmc=177480}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis, except that ATP is reduced to the [[deoxyribonucleotide]] dATP, before incorporation into DNA.

==Binding to proteins==
[[Image:Rossmann-fold-1g5q.png|thumb|300px|An example of the Rossmann fold, a [[structural domain]] of a [[decarboxylase]] enzyme from the bacterium ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' (PDB ID 1G5Q) with a bound [[flavin mononucleotide]] cofactor.]]
Some proteins that bind ATP do so in a characteristic [[tertiary structure|protein fold]] known as the [[Rossmann fold]], which is a general [[nucleotide]]-binding [[structural domain]] that can also bind the [[coenzyme]] [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rao S, Rossmann M | title = Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 241–56 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4737475 | doi=10.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common ATP-binding proteins, known as [[kinases]], share a small number of common folds; the [[protein kinase]]s, the largest kinase superfamily, all share common structural features specialized for ATP binding and phosphate transfer.&lt;ref name=Scheeff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scheeff E, Bourne P | title = Structural evolution of the protein kinase-like superfamily  |pmc=1261164
 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049 | journal = PLoS Comput Biol | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = e49 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16244704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP in complexes with proteins generally requires the presence of a [[divalent]] [[cation]], almost always [[magnesium]], which binds to the ATP phosphate groups. The presence of magnesium greatly decreases the [[dissociation constant]] of ATP from its protein binding partner without affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the ATP has bound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saylor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saylor P, Wang C, Hirai T, Adams J | title = A second magnesium ion is critical for ATP binding in the kinase domain of the oncoprotein v-Fps | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 36 | pages = 12624–30 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9730835 | doi = 10.1021/bi9812672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lin X, Ayrapetov M, Sun G | title = Characterization of the interactions between the active site of a protein tyrosine kinase and a divalent metal activator |pmc=1316873 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2091-6-25 | journal = BMC Biochem | volume = 6 | pages = 25 | year = 2005| pmid = 16305747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ATP analogues==
Biochemistry laboratories often use ''[[in vitro]]'' studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. [[Enzyme inhibitor]]s of ATP-dependent enzymes such as [[kinase]]s are needed to examine the [[binding site]]s and [[transition state]]s involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine a [[protein structure]] in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.
Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5'-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a [[sulfur]] atom; this molecule is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound [[vanadate]] ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.&lt;ref name=Resetar&gt;{{cite journal | author=Resetar AM, Chalovich JM. | year=1995 | title= Adenosine 5'-(gamma-thiotriphosphate): an ATP analog that should be used with caution in muscle contraction studies | volume=34 | issue=49 | pages=16039–45 | pmid=8519760 | doi = 10.1021/bi00049a018 | journal= Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Daugthers of Ægir and Rán.jpg|thumb|250px|Ægir and his daughters brew ale in a large pot.]]
'''Ægir''' ([[Old Norse]] &quot;sea&quot;&lt;ref name=LINDOW47&gt;Lindow (2001:47).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[jötunn|sea giant]], god of the [[ocean]] and king of the sea creatures in [[Norse mythology]]. He is also known for hosting elaborate parties for the [[Æsir|gods]].

Ægir's servants are [[Fimafeng]] (killed by [[Loki]]) and [[Eldir]].

== Description ==
While many versions of myths portray Ægir as a giant, it is curious that many do not. In some texts, he is referred to as something older than the giants, and his origins are not really explained.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Attestations ==
Both ''[[Fundinn Noregr]]'' and [[Snorri Sturluson]] in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant '''Hlér''', who lives on the isle of [[Hlesey|Hlésey]], and this is borne out by kennings.&lt;ref name=SIMEK151&gt;Simek (1993:151).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DEVRIES1251&gt;de Vries (1956:251).&lt;/ref&gt; Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the [[Prose Edda]].

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by [[Thor]] and [[Týr]]. The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant [[Hymir]] is told in ''[[Hymiskviða]]''.

The prose introduction to ''Lokasenna'' and Snorri's list of kennings state that Ægir is also known as [[Gymir]], who is [[Gerðr]]'s father, but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation of [[kenning]]s in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=SIMEK126&gt;Simek (1993:126).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
[[File:Ægir, ruler of the ocean.jpg|228px|right|]]
According to ''Fundinn Noregr'', Ægir is a son of the giant [[Fornjót]]r and brother of [[Logi]] (&quot;fire&quot;) and [[Kári]] (&quot;wind&quot;).&lt;ref name=LINDOW48&gt;Lindow (2001:48).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ægir's wife is [[Rán]] the sea goddess. She is by Ægir mother of [[Daughters of Ægir|nine billow maidens]], whose names are:
*Bára (or Dröfn, ''wave'')
*Blóðughadda (''the one with blood-red hair – the color of the waves after a naval battle'')
*Bylgja (''to billow'', or ''big wave'')
*Dúfa (''the pitching wave'')
*Hefring (''the surging wave'')
*Himinglæva (''the wave that reflects the light of the sky'')
*Hrönn (''the grasping wave'')
*Kólga (''the chilling wave'')
*Unnr (or Uðr, ''wave'')

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antibacterial''' is a compound or substance that kills or slows down the growth of [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:antibacterial&quot;/&gt;
The term is often used [[synonym]]ously with the term ''antibiotic(s)''; today, however, with increased knowledge of the causative agents of various infectious diseases, ''antibiotic(s)'' has come to denote a broader range of [[antimicrobial]] compounds, including [[anti-fungal]] and other compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:antibiotic&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;antibiotic&quot; was coined by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1942 to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is [[wikt:antagonism|antagonistic]] to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman1947&quot;/&gt; This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but are not produced by microorganisms (such as [[gastric juices]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]). It also excluded [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial compounds such as the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]. Many antibacterial compounds are relatively [[small molecule]]s with a [[molecular weight]] of less than 2000 [[atomic mass unit]]s.

With advances in [[medicinal chemistry]], most of today's antibacterials chemically are [[semisynthetic]] modifications of various natural compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=von Nussbaum F. ''et al.'' |title=Medicinal Chemistry of Antibacterial Natural Products  – Exodus or Revival?|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |volume=45 |issue=31 |pages=5072–5129 |year=2006 |pmid= 16881035 |doi=10.1002/anie.200600350}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include, for example, the [[beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]] antibacterials, which include the [[penicillin]]s (produced by fungi in the genus '[[Penicillium]]'), the [[cephalosporin]]s, and the [[carbapenem]]s. Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the [[aminoglycoside]]s, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the [[sulfonamides]], the [[quinolone]]s, and the [[oxazolidinone]]s—are produced solely by chemical synthesis. Accordingly, many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical/[[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] origin into natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic. Another classification system is based on biological activity; in this classification antibacterials are divided into two broad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms: [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] agents kill bacteria, and [[bacteriostatic agent]]s slow down or stall bacterial growth.

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of antibiotics}}

[[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|170px|[[Penicillin]], the first natural antibiotic discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928.]]
Before the early twentieth century, treatments for infections were based primarily on [[folk medicine|medicinal folklore]]. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Considerations for Determining if a Natural Product Is an Effective Wound-Healing Agent&quot;/&gt; Many ancient cultures, including the [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|ancient Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greeks]] used specially selected [[mold]] and plant materials and extracts to treat [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early history of wound treatment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moulds in ancient and more recent medicine&quot;/&gt; More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between micro-organisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. [[Louis Pasteur]] observed that, &quot;if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston2008&quot;/&gt;

The term ''antibiosis'', meaning &quot;against life,&quot; was introduced by the French bacteriologist [[Vuillemin]] as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Early descriptions of antibiosis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Foster W, Raoult A |title=Early descriptions of antibiosis |journal=J R Coll Gen Pract |volume=24 |issue=149 |pages=889–94 |year=1974 |month=December |pmid=4618289 |pmc=2157443 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and [[Robert Koch]] observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Landsberg |title=Prelude to the discovery of [[penicillin]] |journal=Isis |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=225–227. |year=1949|doi=10.1086/349043}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by [[Selman Waksman]], an American microbiologist in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman1947&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;

Antagonistic activities by fungi against bacteria were first described in England by [[John Tyndall]] in 1875.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston2008&quot;/&gt; Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt; Ehrlich noted that certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, while others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial [[Salvarsan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbird2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch2008&quot;/&gt; In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] observed antibiosis against bacteria by a fungus of the genus 'Penicillium'. Fleming postulated that the effect was mediated by an antibacterial compound named penicillin and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, but he did not pursue its further development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming1929&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykes2001&quot;/&gt; [[Prontosil]], the first commercially available antibacterial antibiotic, was developed by a research team led by [[Gerhard Domagk]] in 1932 (who received the 1939 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] for his efforts) at the [[Bayer]] Laboratories of the [[IG Farben]] conglomerate in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch2008&quot;/&gt; Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against [[Gram-positive]] [[Coccus|cocci]] but not against [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]]. The discovery and development of this first [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] drug opened the era of antibacterial antibiotics. In 1939, Rene Dubos reported discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, [[gramicidin]] from B. brevis. It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics in use during World War II to prove highly effective in treating wounds and ulcers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epps2006&quot;/&gt;

Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying penicillin. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Use of Micro-organisms for therapeutic purposes&quot;/&gt; For their discovery and development of penicillin as a therapeutic drug,  [[Ernst Chain]], [[Howard Florey]], and Alexander Fleming shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.&lt;ref name=Epps2006/&gt;

Antibiotics diffuse out from antibiotic-containing disks and inhibit growth of ''S. aureus'', resulting in a zone of inhibition]]

The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include [[Immune system|host defense mechanisms]], the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt; A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary-phase and nondividing Staphylococcus aureus cells&quot;/&gt; These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pelczar, M.J., Chan, E.C.S. and Krieg, N.R. (1999) “Host-Parasite Interaction; Nonspecific Host Resistance”, In: Microbiology Concepts and Applications, 6th ed., McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, U.S.A. pp. 478-479.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhee2004&quot;/&gt; ''in vitro'' characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)of antimicrobial substances&quot;/&gt;
To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotic therapy for severe bacterial infections: correlation between the inhibitory quotient and outcome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medind.nic.in/ibi/t02/i6/ibit02i6p390.pdf (accessed 13th Nov 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes==
{{Main|List of antibiotics}}
[[File:Antibiotics action.png|right|thumb|150px|Molecular targets of antibiotics on the bacteria cell]]

Like antibiotics, antibacterials are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most antibacterial antibiotics target bacterial functions or growth processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt; Antibiotics that target the bacterial cell wall (such as penicillins and cephalosporins), or cell membrane (for example, polymixins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (such as quinolones and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities. Those that target protein synthesis, such as the aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines, are usually bacteriostatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;The importance of bactericidal drugs: future directions in infectious disease&quot;/&gt; Further categorization is based on their target specificity. &quot;Narrow-spectrum&quot; antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, three new classes of antibiotics have been brought into clinical use. These new antibacterials are cyclic lipopeptides (including [[daptomycin]]), glycylcyclines (e.g., [[tigecycline]]), and oxazolidinones (including [[linezolid]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cunha BA. Antibiotic Essentials 2009. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, ISBN 978-0-7637-7219-2 p. 180, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
{{Main|Production of antibiotics}}

Since the first pioneering efforts of [[Howard Florey, Baron Florey|Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain|Chain]] in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to [[medicine]] has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]], usually in strongly aerobic conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Administration===
Oral antibacterials are orally ingested, whereas [[intravenous]] administration may be used in more serious cases, such as deep-seated [[systemic infection]]s. Antibiotics may also sometimes be administered [[topical]]ly, as with [[eye drop]]s or [[ointment]]s.

=== Side effects ===
Antibacterials are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use and are usually considered safe and most are well-tolerated. However, some antibacterials have been associated with a range of adverse effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;
Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt; Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions including [[photodermatitis]] and anaphylaxis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Common side-effects include [[diarrhea]], resulting from disruption of the species composition in the [[intestinal flora]], resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan Health System: [http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_aadiarrh_crs.htm Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea], November 26, 2006 {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibacterials can also affect the [[vaginal flora]], and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' in the vulvo-vaginal area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pirotta and Garland&quot;/&gt; Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of [[tendon]] damage from administration of a [[Quinolones|quinolone]] antibiotic with a systemic [[corticosteroid]].

==Drug-drug interactions==
===[[Contraceptive pill]]s===
The majority of studies indicate that antibiotics do not interfere with contraceptive pills,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt; such as clinical studies that suggest that the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10384856&quot;/&gt; In cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial [[rifampicin]], these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt;  Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3155374&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2256523&quot;/&gt; Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures are applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt;

===Alcohol===
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibacterials may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibacterial therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmj&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;antibiotics-and-alcohol&quot;/&gt;
:&quot;It is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medication. However, it is unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics. However, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol should be avoided completely, because of serious side-effects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot; /&gt;
Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibacterial administered. Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication, the belief that alcohol and antibacterials should never be mixed is widespread.

Antibacterials such as [[metronidazole]], [[tinidazole]], [[cephamandole]], [[latamoxef]], [[cefoperazone]], [[cefmenoxime]], and [[furazolidone]], cause a [[disulfiram]]-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot;/&gt;

Other effects of alcohol on antibacterial activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibacterial compound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotics FAQ&quot;/&gt; In addition, serum levels of doxycycline and [[erythromycin]] succinate{{Clarify|Why do these serum levels matter?|date=February 2010}} two bacteriostatic antibacterials (see above) may be reduced by alcohol consumption resulting in reduced efficacy  and diminished pharmacotherapeutic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Stockley, IH (2002), Stockley's Drug Interactions. 6th ed. London: Pharmaceutical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance ==
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}

[[File:MRSA7820.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scanning electron micrograph|SEM]] depicting [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] bacteria.]]

The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibacterial drug therapy. The antibacterial treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibacterials. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balancing the drug-resistance equation&quot;/&gt; For example, antibacterial selection within whole bacterial populations for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance&quot;/&gt; Survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt; Resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]].  Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Field Guide To Bacteria, The World Of Bacteria&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Betsey Dexter|title=A Field Guide To Bacteria|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801488542|pages=Chapter 9, Pathogens|url=http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002VA8L4Y&amp;qid=1305345229&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Antibacterials like penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, because of increased resistance of many bacterial strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews.com&quot;/&gt; Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost thereby reducing [[biological fitness|fitness]] of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: any practical conclusions?&quot;/&gt;

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alekshun2007&quot;/&gt; For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial [[genome]]. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alekshun2007&quot;/&gt; Antibacterial-producing  bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide-producing organisms&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Multidrug Resistance in Bacteria&quot;/&gt; The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by [[Horizontal gene transfer|horizontal genetic exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt; For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via [[plasmids]] that carry these resistance genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt; Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt; Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt;

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as &quot;superbugs&quot;, now contribute to the emergence of diseases which were for a while well-controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing [[tuberculosis]] (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]&quot;. ''World Health Organization (WHO).''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[NDM-1]] is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of [[beta-lactam]] antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Are you ready for a world without antibiotics?&quot;/&gt; United Kingdom [[Health Protection Agency]] has stated that &quot;most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Protection Report&quot;/&gt;

=== Misuse ===
[[File:CDC Get Smart poster healthy adult.png|thumb|This poster from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &quot;Get Smart&quot; campaign, intended for use in doctor's offices and other healthcare facilities, warns that antibiotics do not work for viral illnesses such as the common cold.]]
{{quote|The first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marino&quot;/&gt;|Paul L. Marino|''The ICU Book''}}
Inappropriate antibacterial treatment and [[overuse of antibiotic]]s have contributed to the emergence of antibacterial-resistant bacteria. [[Self-prescribing|Self prescription]] of antibacterials and their use as growth promoters in agriculture are additional examples of misuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; Many antibacterials are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibacterial therapy or are likely to resolve without treatment, or incorrect or sub-optimal antibacterials are prescribed for certain bacterial infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; The overuse of antibacterials, like penicillin and erythromycin, have been associated with emerging antibacterial resistance since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkey2008&quot;/&gt; Widespread usage of antibacterial drugs in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkey2008&quot;/&gt;

Common forms of antibacterial misuse include excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibacterials on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibacterial, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibacterial treatment, for example, is the prescription of antibacterials to treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]]. One study on [[respiratory tract infection]]s found &quot;physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17467120&quot;/&gt; Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17509729&quot;/&gt;

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the U.S. Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance, and is coordinated by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), as well as other US agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pharmguide&quot;/&gt; An NGO campaign group is ''Keep Antibiotics Working''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keep Antibiotics Working&quot;/&gt; In France, an &quot;Antibiotics are not automatic&quot; government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibacterial prescriptions, especially in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sabuncu E, David J, Bernède-Bauduin C ''et al.'' |editor1-last= Klugman |editor1-first= Keith P. |title= Significant reduction of antibiotic use in the community after a nationwide campaign in France, 2002–2007 |year=2009 |journal= PLoS Med |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e1000084 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |pmid= 19492093 |pmc= 2683932|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uJyYYA93 |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In agriculture, antibacterials are often used to promote weight gain in livestock animals. More than 70% of the antibacterials used in U.S. are given to livestock animals in the absence of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Mellon, M ''et al.'' (2001) ''Hogging It!: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock'', 1st ed. Cambridge, MA: [[Union of Concerned Scientists]].&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has been associated with the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains of bacteria including ''Salmonella'' spp., ''Campylobacter'' spp., ''Escherichia coli'', and ''Enterococcus'' spp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_EMC_ZOO_97.4.pdf (accessed Nov 12, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHO_EMC_ZDI_98.12_(p1-p130).pdf (accessed Nov 12, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of antibacterial resistance has prompted restrictions on antibacterial use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibacterials as growth-promotional agents since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/T80294.htm (accessed Nov 12, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all non-therapeutic uses. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibacterials, partly attributable to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibacterials, and to the time required for research to test causal links between antibacterial use and resistance. Two federal bills (S.742&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill1&quot;/&gt; and H.R. 2562&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill2&quot;/&gt;) aimed at phasing out non-therapeutic use of antibacterials in US food animals were proposed but have not passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill2&quot;/&gt; These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses’ Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpm.org/2003051H.pdf (accessed Nov 12, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
The increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of alternative strategies to treat bacterial diseases.

===Resistance-modifying agents===
One strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials. For example, some resistance-modifying agents may inhibit multi-drug resistance mechanisms, such as [[drug efflux]] from the cell, thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to a antibacterial. Targets include:
* The [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux inhibitor]] Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2005.04.012 | author = Marquez B | year = 2005 | title = Bacterial efflux systems and efflux pumps inhibitors | url = | journal = Biochimie | volume = 87 | issue = 12| pages = 1137–1147 | pmid = 15951096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]].

===[[Phage therapy]]===
Phage therapy is the use of viruses (called [[Bacteriophage|phages]]) that infect bacteria for the treatment of bacterial infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bacteriophages&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattey2008&quot;/&gt; Phages are common in bacterial populations and control the growth of bacteria in many environments, including in the intestine, the ocean, and the soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacteriophage Ecology: Population Growth, Evolution and Impact of Bacterial Viruses&quot;/&gt;  Phage therapy was in use in the 1920s and 1930s in the US, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe. However, success rates of this therapy have not been firmly established, because only a limited number of [[clinical trials]] testing the efficacy of phage therapy have been conducted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattey2008&quot;/&gt; These studies were performed mainly in the former Soviet Union, at the [[George Eliava Institute|Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology &amp; Virology]], [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kutateladze2008&quot;/&gt; The development of antibacterial-resistant bacteria has sparked renewed interest in phage therapy in Western medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merril2003&quot;/&gt; Several companies (e.g., [[Intralytix]], Novolytics, and Gangagen), universities, and foundations across the world now focus on phage therapies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merril2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abuladze2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thiel2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parfitt2005&quot;/&gt; One concern with this therapeutic strategy is the use of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] viruses, which limits certain aspects of phage therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattey2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dispersing biofilms with engineered enzymatic bacteriophage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Retargeting R-type pyocins to generate novel bactericidal protein complexes&quot;/&gt;

===[[Bacteriocin]]s===
Bacteriocins are [[peptide]]s, that can be more readily engineered than small molecules,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15777256&quot;/&gt; and are possible alternatives to conventional antibacterial compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colicins and microcins: the next generation antimicrobials&quot;/&gt;  Different classes of bacteriocins have different potential as therapeutic agents. Small-molecule bacteriocins ([[microcin]]s and [[lantibiotic]]s) are similar to the classic antibiotics; [[colicin]]-like bacteriocins possess a narrow spectrum, and require molecular diagnostics prior to therapy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Limitations of large-molecule antibacterials include reduced transport across membranes and within the human body. For this reason, they are usually applied topically or gastrointestinally.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17168847&quot;/&gt;

===[[Chelation]]===
Chelation of micronutrients that are essential for bacterial growth to restrict pathogen spread ''in vivo'' might supplement some antibacterials. For example, limiting the [[iron]] availability in the human body restricts bacterial proliferation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Effects of iron chelators and iron overload on ''Salmonella'' infection&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7768775&quot;/&gt;  Many bacteria, however, possess mechanisms (such as [[siderophores]]) for scavenging iron within [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] in the human body, and experimental developments of iron chelators therefore aim to reduce iron availability specifically to bacterial pathogens.&lt;ref name=&quot;The effect of synthetic iron chelators on bacterial growth in human serum&quot;/&gt;

===[[Vaccines]]===
[[Vaccine]]s rely on [[immune]] modulation or augmentation.  Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competency of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of [[macrophages]], the production of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[inflammation]], and other classic immune reactions. Anti-bacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been largely replaced by less reactogenic cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.&lt;ref name=MillerAAMillerPF&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, AA; Miller, PF (editor) | year=2011 | title=Emerging Trends in Antibacterial Discovery: Answering the Call to Arms | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Biotherapy]]===
Biotherapy may employ organisms, such as protozoa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Phagotrophic protozoa: A new weapon against pathogens?&quot;/&gt; to consume the bacterial pathogens. Another such approach is [[maggot therapy]].

===[[Probiotics]]===
Probiotics consist of a live culture of bacteria, which may become established as [[Competitive exclusion principle|competing symbionts]], and inhibit or interfere with colonization by microbial pathogens.&lt;ref name=&quot; LjunghWadstrom&quot;/&gt;

===Host defense peptides===
An additional therapeutic agent is the enhancement of the multifunctional properties of natural anti-infectives, such as cationic host defense (antimicrobial) peptides (HDPs).&lt;ref name=MillerAAMillerPF /&gt;

'''Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger'''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-en|ˈʃwɔrtsənɛɡər}}, {{IPA-de|ˈaɐnɔlt ˈalɔʏs ˈʃvaɐtsənˌʔɛɡɐ|lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American former professional bodybuilder, actor, model, businessman and [[Politics of the United States|politician]] who served as the [[List of Governors of California|38th Governor of California]] (2003–2011).

Schwarzenegger began weight training at 15 years of age. He was awarded the title of [[World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships|Mr. Universe]] at age 20 and went on to win the [[Mr. Olympia]] contest seven times. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in the sport of bodybuilding and he has written several books and numerous articles on the sport.  Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] action film icon. He was nicknamed the &quot;Austrian Oak&quot; and the &quot;[[Styria]]n Oak&quot; in his bodybuilding days, &quot;Arnie&quot; during his acting career and more recently the &quot;Governator&quot; (a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of &quot;Governor&quot; and &quot;[[Terminator (character)|Terminator]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography for Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/bio |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]] to replace then-Governor [[Gray Davis]]. Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of Davis's term. Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7, 2006, in [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|California's 2006 gubernatorial election]], to serve a full term as governor, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Phil Angelides]], who was [[California State Treasurer]] at the time. Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501386.html |title=Schwarzenegger Sworn in for Second Term |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 23, 2008 |last=Kurtzman|first=Laura | work=The Washington Post | date=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger has been married to [[Maria Shriver]] for over 25 years and the couple has four children together. In 2011 it was revealed that he had fathered a son fourteen years earlier with an employee, Mildred Baena, leading to Shriver's separation from him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-mistress-revealed WORLD EXCLUSIVE: Mother Of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Love Child Revealed! | Radar Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Schwarzenegger was born in [[Thal, Austria]], a small village bordering the [[Styria]]n capital [[Graz]], and was christened Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Time of His Life |url=http://schwarzenegger.com |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were the local [[police chief]], [[Gustav Schwarzenegger]] (1907–1972), and Aurelia (née Jadrny; 1922–1998). His father served in [[World War II]] with the [[German Army]] as a [[Hauptfeldwebel]] of the [[Feldgendarmerie]] and was discharged in 1943 after contracting [[malaria]]. They were married on October 20, 1945&amp;nbsp;– Gustav was 38, and Aurelia was a 23-year-old widow with a son named Meinhard. According to Schwarzenegger, both of his parents were very strict: &quot;Back then in Austria it was a very different world, if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] every Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |title=True Myths of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-58234-465-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric|last=Herman|title=Ah-nold in cross hairs Rivals blast Calif. front-runner|date=August 11, 2003|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2003/08/11/2003-08-11__ah-nold_in_cross_hairs__riv.html|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=September 14, 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav had a preference for his stepson Meinhard, over his son, Arnold.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Xan |last=Brooks |title=The Governator |date=August 8, 2003 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/aug/08/usa.politicsandthearts |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 19, 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favoritism was &quot;strong and blatant,&quot; which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his child.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leigh |first=Wendy |title=Arnold: An Unauthorized Biography |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-7207-1997-0 |publisher=Pelham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger has said his father had &quot;no patience for listening or understanding your problems... there was a wall; a real wall.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: Mr. Olympia&amp;nbsp;– 1970–1975, 1980 |publisher=BodyBuild.com |url=http://www.bodybuildbid.com/articles/mrolympia/arnold-schwarzenegger.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of atrocities despite Gustav's membership in the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt; Ironically, Schwarzenneger's father's background received wide press attention during the 2003 [[California recall]] campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2003-08-24-arnold-father_x.htm|title=Records: Arnold's father was member of Nazi storm troops|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the absence, ever, of press reporting of Schwarzenneger's opponent's family history during, or since the gubernatorial recall election in 2003, that the then Governor, [[Gray Davis]]'s grandfather, [[William Rhodes Davis]], was described in the press after WWII to have been a Nazi [[Abwehr]] agent&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=ix4yAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=abwehr+agent+c-80&amp;dq=abwehr+agent+c-80&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mwfVTePeGqrk0gGF-Zy2DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA&lt;/ref&gt; accused of funding republican presidential candidate, Wendell Wilkie in the 1940 U.S. presidential election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=HERB+PARMELET+SAM+PRYOR&amp;btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=PARMET+%22Willkie%27s+friend+to+use+his+private+airplane+to*%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=1531c49d9c39fc37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samuelpryor.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, Schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his &quot;cheerful, good-humored and exuberant&quot; character.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt;

As a boy, Schwarzenegger played many sports, heavily influenced by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; He picked up his first [[barbell]] in 1960, when his [[Association football|football]] coach took his team to a local gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; At the age of 14, he chose [[bodybuilding]] over football (soccer) as a career.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-074214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=August 31, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: &quot;I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; However, his official website biography claims: &quot;At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Everything |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech in 2001, he said, ''&quot;My own plan formed when I was 14 years old.

In 1971, his brother Meinhard died in a car accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; Meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly.

Schwarzenegger would pay for Patrick's education and help him to immigrate to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt; Gustav died the following year from a stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; In ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image more cold and machine-like in order to fan controversy for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''Pumping Iron&amp;nbsp;– 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=October 6, 2003 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/02/bfarni02.xml&amp;page=1 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=April 18, 2008 | location=London | first=Oliver | last=Poole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt;

I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'you can't do this,' I said, 'this is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'}}

===Early adulthood===
Schwarzenegger served in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian Army]] in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; He went [[AWOL]] during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: &quot;Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.&quot; He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous.

&quot;The [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title was my ticket to America&amp;nbsp;– the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;per&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the [[NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner [[Chester Yorton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt;

Charles &quot;Wag&quot; Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in [[Forest Gate]], London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the [[East End of London]] helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Wag Bennett bodybuilder who helped Arnold Schwarzenegger | date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis Arnold Schwarzenegger: Made in Britain], [[British Film Institute]].

===Move to the U.S.===
[[File:Reagan+Schwarzenegger1984.jpg|thumb|upright|Schwarzenegger with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984.]]

{{See also|Bodybuilding competitions featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger}}
Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine ''MuscleMag International'' has a monthly two-page article on him, and refers to him as &quot;The King&quot;.

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding contests, as well as some [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] contests, including five Mr. Universe (4&amp;nbsp;– [[NABBA]] [England], 1&amp;nbsp;– [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [USA]) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out even today. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 [[Arnold Classic]] he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc&amp;feature=related YouTube - 2011 Ask Arnold Training Seminar- Arnold Schwarzenegger Talks Bodybuilding Advice - Part 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strongman===
In 1967, Schwarzenegger competed in and won the [[Munich]] stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&amp;nbsp;kg/560&amp;nbsp;lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests.

===Mr. Olympia===
{{Image|Arnold Schwarzenegger and Karyn Marshall.JPG|thumb|left|Schwarzenegger presented awards at the USA Weightlifting Hall of Fame in 2011 in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. In photo: 1987 world champion American [[Karyn Marshall]].}}
Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming [[Mr. Olympia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he holds to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt;

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt;

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: &quot;Why not compete?&quot; Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

===Steroid use===
Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that &quot;steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when [[Weight cutting|cutting up]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conan the Politician |publisher=ESPN |url=http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Farrey |first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has called the drugs &quot;tissue building.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold Steroids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold &amp; Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his [[#Accidents and medical issues|later heart problems]]. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Wins German Lawsuit |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |work=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=UPI |date=December 1, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie settles $50m libel case |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |date=December 22, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's ''[[Hercules in New York]]''. Credited under the name &quot;Arnold Strong,&quot; his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; His second film appearance was as a deaf mute hit-man for the mob in director [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor|Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. &quot;It was very difficult for me in the beginning&amp;nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the [[bodybuilding]] film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977),&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |accessdate=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''. In 1980 he starred in a [[biopic]] of the 1950s actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]].

[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.jpeg|thumb|Arnold Schwarzenegger's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame]]
Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;/&gt; This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video &quot;[[Rio Carnival|Carnival in Rio]]&quot;.

In 1984, he made the first of three appearances as the eponymous character and what some would say was the signature role in his acting career in director [[James Cameron]]'s science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanleam&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leamer |first=Laurence |title=Fantastic: The life of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2005 |publisher=St Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-33338-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following ''The Terminator'', Schwarzenegger made ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'' in 1985, which &quot;sank without a trace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;/&gt;

During the 1980s, audiences had a large appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and [[Sylvester Stallone]] becoming international stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his droll, often self-deprecating sense of humor (including sometimes famously bad puns), separating his roles from more serious action hero fare. His alternative-universe comedy/thriller ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' featured a poster of the movie ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which, in the fictional alternate universe, had [[Sylvester Stallone]] as its star.

Following his arrival as a Hollywood superstar, he made a number of successful films: ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 movie)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988). In ''[[Predator (movie)|Predator]]'' (1987), another successful film, Schwarzenegger led a cast which included future [[Minnesota]] [[List of Governors of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Jesse Ventura]] (Ventura also appeared in ''[[The Running Man (film)|The Running Man]]'' and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' with Schwarzenegger) and future candidate for [[governor of Kentucky]] [[Sonny Landham]].

[[File:Chth arnold schwarzenegger.jpg|left|thumb|Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]]]
''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], was a change of pace, and also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&amp;nbsp;million and 15% of the gross, and was a widely praised, science fiction script directed by Paul Verhoeven, based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story, &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot;. ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) reunited him with director [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed him in ''Twins''. The movie also featured actress [[Pamela Reed]].

Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into [[Film director|directing]], first with a 1990 episode of the TV series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled &quot;[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]]&quot;, and then with the 1992 [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut]]''. He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial high-water mark was his return as the title character in 1991's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the &quot;International Star of the Decade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[parody|spoof]] ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', with the box office suffering accordingly. His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994) was a highly popular spy film, and saw Schwarzenegger, reunited with James Cameron, appearing opposite [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].

[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2003.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arnold Schwarzenegger at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival]]
Shortly thereafter came the comedy ''[[Junior (film)|Junior]]'' (1994), the last of his three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring [[Danny DeVito]] and also for the second time featuring [[Pamela Reed]]. This film brought Schwarzenegger his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996) with Arnold playing the main character, Howard Langston, and the [[comic book]]-based ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), where he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', Schwarzenegger's film career and box office prominence went into decline.

Several film projects were announced with Schwarzenegger attached to star, including the remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', a new film version of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'', and a World War II film scripted by [[Quentin Tarantino]] that would have seen Schwarzenegger play an Austrian for the fourth time (after ''Stay Hungry'', ''Junior'' and ''Kindergarten Cop'').

Instead, he returned after a hiatus with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|''End of Days'']]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002) all of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which went on to earn over $150&amp;nbsp;million domestically.

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82&amp;nbsp;ft) tall ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=September 27, 2002 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His film appearances after becoming Governor of California include a 3-second cameo appearance in ''[[The Rundown]]'' (a.k.a., ''Welcome to the Jungle'') with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], and the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 movie)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', where he appeared onscreen with action star [[Jackie Chan]] for the first time. In 2005 he appeared as himself in the film ''[[The Kid &amp; I]]''. Schwarzenegger voiced [[Baron von Steuben]] in Episode 24 (&quot;[[Valley Forge]]&quot;) of ''[[Liberty's Kids]]''.

Schwarzenegger had been rumored to be appearing in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' as the original T-800 model, alongside [[Roland Kickinger]]. Schwarzenegger denied his involvement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php |title=Arnold downplays a Terminator Salvation cameo |publisher=SCI FI Wire |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later revealed that although he would appear briefly he would not be shooting new footage, and his image would be inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first Terminator movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger (Virtually) Back in Terminator Salvation|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg|title=McG Talks Terminator Salvation|publisher=reelzchannel.com|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's most recent appearance was in Sylvester Stallone's ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', where he made a [[cameo appearance]] alongside Stallone and [[Bruce Willis]].

===Return to acting===
In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama ''With Wings as Eagles'', written by [[Randall Wallace]], based on a true story. Of the scripts, Arnold said, &quot;Currently I'm reading three scripts. One topic/script, which I considered a long time ago before governor, is delighting me particularly. In it I would play an older [German] soldier, who gets the order at the ending of the war to kill a bunch of kids. But he doesn't do it and get them to safety at the risk of his life and it has all kind of adventure. This script is based on a true story!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/Welt/Schwarzenegger_Ich_lese_gerade_drei_Drehbuecher-Krone-Interview-Story-240860 |title=Schwarzenegger: &quot;Ich lese gerade drei Drehbücher&quot; - &quot;Krone&quot;-Interview - Welt |publisher=krone.at |date=2011-01-16 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1741.html |title=TheArnoldFans.com |publisher=TheArnoldFans.com |date=2011-01-16 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2011, Schwarzenegger officially announced that he is returning to acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=628473&amp;GT1=28101 |title=Schwarzenegger says he's returning to acting |publisher=[[MSN]] |date=February 11, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the [[Arnold Classic]], Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being courted for more than fifteen films, including sequels to ''[[The Terminator]]'' and remakes of ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[The Running Man (film)|The Running Man]]'', and that he was &quot;packaging&quot; a comic book character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1767.html |title=TheArnoldFans.com |publisher=TheArnoldFans.com |date=2011-03-06 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was later revealed to be [[the Governator]], star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with [[Stan Lee]], who will produce the series. Schwarzenegger will also voice the Governator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/03/30/arnold-schwarzenegger-the-governator-exclusive|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as 'The Governator'|author=Benjamin Svetkey|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/31/the-governator-arnold-schwarzenegger_n_842921.html|title='The Governator': Arnold Schwarzenegger Developing New Cartoon, Comic Book|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12918406|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger to make superhero show|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-teams-up-with-stan-lee-on-cartoon-series-the-governator.html|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger teams with Stan Lee on 'The Governator'|author=Melissa Maerz|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 5, 2011, it was reported that Schwarzenegger had signed on to the [[drama film]] ''[[Cry Macho]]'' and that filming should start in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-closes-next-film-worldwide-rights-will-sell-at-cannes-fest|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Closes Next Film: Worldwide Rights Will Sell At Cannes Fest|author=Nikki Finke|publisher=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-picks-drama-cry-185435|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Picks Drama 'Cry Macho' for Big-Screen Return (Cannes)|author=Gregg Kilday|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all movie projects currently in development were being halted. &quot;Governor Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20496056,00.html?xid=rss-fullcontent|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Halts All Acting Projects – Including Terminator|author=Sara Hammel|publisher=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
{{Main|Political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger}}
[[File:Arnold-Cheney.jpg|thumb|right|Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] meets with Schwarzenegger for the first time at the [[White House]].]]

===Early politics===
Schwarzenegger has been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well-known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning community. At the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained why he was a Republican:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN  |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]-[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.

But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, &quot;What party is he?&quot; My friend said, &quot;He's a Republican.&quot; I said, &quot;Then I am a Republican.&quot; And I have been a Republican ever since.}}

In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in ''[[Stop the Madness]]'', an anti-drug music video sponsored by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 Presidential election]], accompanying then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] at a campaign rally.&lt;ref name = &quot;Noonan&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Noonan| first = Peggy| authorlink =Peggy Noonan | title = What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era| publisher=Random House| date = October 14, 2003| location = New York| page = 384 | isbn = 978-0-8129-6989-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him &quot;[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Republican&quot;. He later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor [[Pete Wilson]]. Yet, political analysts have identified Schwarzenegger as a liberal, as he has become more left-leaning since his election.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usliberals.about.com/b/2006/01/14/arnold-schwarzenegger-californias-newest-democrat.htm |title=''Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's Newest Democrat'' |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=White |first=Deborah |date=January 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a [[Red Cross]] ambassador (a mostly ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio [[public service announcement]]s to donate blood. A small amount of interest was garnered by his wearing of a white t-shirt with the Red Cross on it, while posing with a flexed arm; the image made it into several celebrity magazines.

In an interview with ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, &quot;I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold cast as Governor? |date=October 4, 1999 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=90 |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523203946/http%3A//www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp%3Fid%3D90 |archivedate = May 23, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for [[governor of California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;/&gt; Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I'm in show business&amp;nbsp;– I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;/&gt;

===Governor of California===
Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall]] election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; As a candidate in the recall election, Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the &quot;Governator&quot; (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and &quot;The Running Man&quot; (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election &quot;Total Recall&quot; (yet another Schwarzenegger starrer). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstDebate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Grey|first=Barry|title=First debate in California recall election: Snapshot of a political system in crisis|date=November 6, 2003 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml|work=wsws.org|accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Schwarzenegger Bush.jpg|thumb|200px|left|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship]]

On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]], and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million votes. Under the regulations of the [[California Constitution]], no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the first foreign-born governor of California since Irish-born Governor [[John G. Downey]] in 1862.

As soon as Schwarzenegger was elected governor, [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]] said he would start a drive to recall the governor. Schwarzenegger was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up [[gridlock]]. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch &quot;[[Hans and Franz]]&quot; from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians &quot;[[girlie men]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFGirlieMen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=July 18, 2004 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 18, 2008 | first=Peter | last=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger speech.jpg|thumb|200px|left|upright|Schwarzenegger in December 2008]]

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a [[California special election, 2005|special election]] he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that &quot;no one could win if the opposition raised 160&amp;nbsp;million dollars to defeat you&quot;.

Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat [[Phil Angelides]], the [[California State Treasurer]], in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 elections]], held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Election&amp;nbsp;– Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archivedate=2007-02-19 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many commentators have seen Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] breakfast, San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] said that, &quot;[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left&quot;.

It was rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the [[United States Senate]] in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. This turned out to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201476.html|title=Schwarzenegger Remakes Himself as Environmentalist |work=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 13, 2008|first=John |last=Pomfret | date=December 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/03/22/MNJH16KC5G.DTL| title = Predictions for Schwarzenegger's Next Big Role

Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and [[bodybuilding]] as building blocks to escape a depressing home.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt; Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, &quot;I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential&amp;nbsp;–I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, &quot;I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and [[Sargent Shriver]] became my heroes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt; Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger. He cannot run for president as he is not a [[natural born citizen of the United States]]. In ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007), he is portrayed as the President, and in the [[Sylvester Stallone]] movie, ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993, ten years before his first run for political office), it is revealed that a constitutional amendment passed which allowed Schwarzenegger to run for President.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Because of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taxformsre&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Soraya |title=News: Schwarzenegger releases tax returns |publisher=OCRegister.com |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1102616.php |date=April 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated after he left office that being governor cost him as much as $200 million in potential movie deals, but that &quot;it was more than worth it.&quot; {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary]] of the [[2008 U.S. Presidential election]] was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Senator [[John McCain]], Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the Presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, &quot;It's Rudy's fault!&quot; (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Baltimore Sun|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html|title=Arnold opens 'flood' of McCain endorsements|accessdate=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.

In its April 2010 report, [[Progressivism|Progressive]] ethics watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] named Schwarzenegger one of 11 &quot;worst governors&quot; in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Vogel  | first = Ed | author-link =| title = Gibbons named on list of worst governors  | newspaper = ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''  | pages =  | date = 2010-04-21  | url = http://www.lvrj.com/news/gibbons-named-on-list-of-worst-governors-91723774.html  | archiveurl =  | archivedate =  | accessdate = 2010-05-05  | postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last =  | first =   |author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =   |author2-link =  | title = Scandals Land Gibbons On 'Worst Governors' List  | newspaper = [[KVVU-TV]] (Fox 5, Las Vegas)  | pages =  | date = 2010-04-21  | url = http://www.fox5vegas.com/news/23220458/detail.html  | archiveurl =  | archivedate =  | accessdate = 2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first=  |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |title= Crew's Worst Governors |work=  |publisher= [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] |date=  |url= http://www.citizensforethics.org/worstgovernors#Gibbons |doi=  |accessdate = 2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing [[California Proposition 66 (2004)|Proposition 66]], a proposed amendment of the Californian [[Three Strikes Law]], in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence.

===Environmental record===
On September 27, 2006 Schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html | accessdate = May 15, 2008 | work=The Washington Post | title=Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill | first=Samantha | last=Young | date=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan is set to be in effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html | accessdate = May 15, 2008 | work=Fox News | title=Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight | first=Karen | last=Matthews | date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his [[Hummer H1|Hummers]] to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/04/02/8403410/index.htm &quot;The Governator's green agenda&quot;] ''Fortune Magazine''.

==Business career==
Schwarzenegger has also had a highly successful business career.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt; Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a &quot;prolific goal setter&quot; and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car&amp;nbsp;– and succeed in doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt; By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from a series of successful business ventures and investments. In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Millionaire Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Real Life Action Hero |publisher=Millionaire Magazine |url=http://www.millionaire.com/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Morgan |first=Kaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Working&quot; Out |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp?sec=life&amp;subsec=didyouknow |accessdate=April 18, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523204758/http%3A//www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp%3Fsec%3Dlife%26subsec%3Ddidyouknow |archivedate = May 23, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Millionaire Magazine&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger rolled profits from the mail order business and his bodybuilding competition winnings into his first real estate venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000.

===Planet Hollywood===
{{See also|Planet Hollywood}}
Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the [[Planet Hollywood]] chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the [[Hard Rock Cafe]]) along with [[Bruce Willis]], [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Demi Moore]]. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold leaves planet |date=January 25, 2000 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=71 |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on &quot;new US global business ventures&quot; and his movie career.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetar&quot;/&gt;

===Net worth===
Schwarzenegger's net worth has been conservatively estimated at $100–$200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;100million&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Lance |title=Schwarzenegger worth $100&amp;nbsp;million, experts say |date=August 17, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/08/17/TAXES.TMP |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, he invested his [[bodybuilding]] and movie earnings in an array of [[stocks]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]], privately controlled companies and real estate holdings worldwide, so a more accurate estimation of his net worth is difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the USA and Europe. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38&amp;nbsp;million of his own money on a private Gulfstream Jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleming |first=Charles |title=[[High concept: Don Simpson and the Hollywood Culture of Excess]] |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=1999|isbn=978-0-7475-4262-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, &quot;Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50&amp;nbsp;million, but I was just as happy when I had $48&amp;nbsp;million.&quot;&lt;ref name=governG2/&gt; He has also stated, &quot;I've made many millions as a businessman many times over.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;per&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
His official height of 6'2&quot; (1.88&amp;nbsp;m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5&quot; (1.87&amp;nbsp;m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeightArnold&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Height, Schwarzenegger's |publisher=celebheights.com |url=http://www.celebheights.com/s/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-177.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Measured |publisher=ArnoldHeight |url=http://www.arnoldheight.com/article5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1988 both the ''Daily Mail'' and ''Time Out'' magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, N: &quot;True Myths: The life and times of Arnold Schwarzenegger,&quot; page 157. Bloomsbury, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, before running for Governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the ''[[Chicago Reader]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poor Recall |work=Chicago Reader |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/hottype/2003/030919_1.html |date=September 23, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Miner |first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, ''&quot;[s]ettle this once and for all and find out how tall he is&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Incoming governor's mantra: 'Action' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/10/23/MNG2C2HG8R1.DTL |date=October 23, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Salladay |first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor.

In 2005, [[Peter Pilz]], from the [[Austrian Green Party]], demanded that parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: ''A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DamageAustria&quot;/&gt; Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.

Schwarzenegger's home town of [[Graz]] had its soccer stadium named ''The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium'' in his honor. It is the home of both [[Grazer AK]] and [[Sturm Graz]]. Following the [[Stanley Williams]] execution and after street protests in his hometown, several local politicians began a campaign to remove Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium. Schwarzenegger responded, saying that
''&quot;to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the Liebenau Stadium&quot;'', and set a tight deadline of just a couple of days to remove his name. Graz officials removed Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Graz removes Schwarzenegger name |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4560182.stm |date=December 26, 2005 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now officially titled [[UPC-Arena]].

The Sun Valley Resort has a short ski trail called ''Arnold's Run'', named after Schwarzenegger (It was named after him in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtexpress.com/2001/01-12-05/01-12-05arnoldsrun.htm|title=And ... here's Arnold's Run|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trail is categorized as a black diamond, or most difficult, for its terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger to undergo surgery |publisher=The Insider |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1226_Arnold_Schwarzenegger_to_undergo_surgery |date=December 25, 2006 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He bought the first Hummer manufactured for civilian use in 1992, a model so large, {{convert|6300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide, that it is classified as a large truck and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to it. During the Gubernatorial Recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Wickell |first=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in [[Thal, Austria|Thal]] celebrated Schwarzenegger's 60th birthday by throwing a party. Officials proclaimed A Day for Arnold on July 30, 2007.

On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger was the 18th runner on the 106th day of the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay.  His leg was along the [[Stanley Park]] Seawall, and he exchanged a &quot;torch kiss&quot; with the next runner, [[Sebastian Coe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://olympics.thestar.com/2010/article/764519--how-vancouver-almost-lost-the-2010-olympics|title=How Vancouver almost lost the 2010 Olympics&amp;nbsp;—Vancouver 2010 Olympics|publisher=Olympics.thestar.com|date=February 12, 2010|accessdate=March 8, 2010|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early love life===
In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher he lived with until 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;arniememoir&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie's ex-girlfriend pens memoir |date=September 9, 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3092740.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his [[memoir]] in 1977: &quot;Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;arniememoir&quot;/&gt; Baker has described Schwarzenegger as &quot;[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic&quot; but claims towards the end of the relationship he became &quot;insufferable&amp;nbsp;– classically conceited&amp;nbsp;– the world revolved around him&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor's old flame says he's a great guy |date=September 15, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/15/MN272943.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 19, 2007 | first=Lance | last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled ''Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Elsworth |title=Arnie puts his weight behind ex-lover's tell-all memoir |date=September 14, 2006 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1528857/Arnie-puts-his-weight-behind-ex-lover%27s-tell-all-memoir.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=April 18, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;/&gt; Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;/&gt; The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;– their first date was watching the [[Apollo 11|first Apollo Moon landing]] on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt; They shared an [[apartment]] in [[Santa Monica]] for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt; Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had &quot;little understanding of polite society&quot; and she found him a turn-off, she says, &quot;He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be&amp;nbsp;–he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger met his next love, Sue Moray, a [[Beverly Hills]] hairdresser's assistant, on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: &quot;We were faithful when we were both in LA ... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger met [[Maria Shriver]] at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977, and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual and personal misconduct===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger sexual harassment protestors750.jpg|thumb|[[Code Pink]] protesting against Schwarzenegger]]
During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger, dubbed &quot;Gropegate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;grope1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex scandal draws Arnie apology |date=March 10, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3159122.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the ''Los Angeles Times'' recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;behaving badly&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger sorry for behaving 'badly' toward women |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html |date=October 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.&lt;ref name=&quot;grope1&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger admitted that he has &quot;behaved badly sometimes&quot; and apologized, but also stated that &quot;a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true&quot;. This came after an interview in adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' from 1977 surfaced, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger's Sex Talk |publisher=The Smoking Gun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldinter1.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film ''[[Pumping Iron]].''

===Accidents and injuries===
Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right [[femur]] while skiing in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]] with his family on December 23, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press|title=Calif.

He was released from the [[St. John's Health Center]] on December 30, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schwarzenegger cleared to resume duties after surgery |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 26, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger did not delay his second oath of office on January 5, 2007, although he was still on crutches at the time.

Schwarzenegger has twice crashed motorcycles on public highways, injuring himself in the process. On January 8, 2006, while riding his [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, the governor sustained a minor injury to his lip, forcing him to get 15 stitches. &quot;No citations were issued&quot;, said Officer Jason Lee, a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10811025/|title=No Charges Against Schwarzenegger|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, on December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;MotorAccident&quot;&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press|title=Schwarzenegger, son get in motorcycle accident |work=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-09-schwarzenegger-accident_x.htm |date=January 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Navarro|first=Mireya|title=Schwarzenegger Finally Gets a License|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/us/07arnold.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger was born with a [[bicuspid aortic valve]], an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surgery Leaves Star Undimmed |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEWS+LITE+:+SURGERY+LEAVES+STAR+UNDIMMED-a083864140 |work=The Free Library |publisher=Farlex |date=April 18, 1997 |accessdate=July 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Surgery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Starnes| first = Dr. Vaughn A.|title =Renowned Cardiac Surgeon Proclaims Medical &quot;Facts&quot; In Article &quot;Represent No Facts At All&quot;|date = March 8, 2001|url = http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_18.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=uptotheminute| doi = |accessdate = March 3, 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523203941/http%3A//www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_18.asp%3Fsec%3Dnews%26subsec%3Duptotheminute |archivedate = May 23, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElectHeart&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger Has Elective Heart Surgery |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D9113FF93BA25757C0A961958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fS%2fSchwarzenegger%2c%20Arnold |date=April 18, 1997 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at [[Van Nuys Airport]] on June 19, 2009 after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by the governor's press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Santa Cruz| coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Governor's plane makes emergency landing in Van Nuys | date=June 19, 2009| work=LA Times|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/06/governors-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-van-nuys.html|work=The Los Angeles Times| pages = | accessdate = June 20, 2009|language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Actium en.svg|thumb|300px|A map showing Actium.]]

'''Actium''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἄκτιον) was the ancient name of a [[promontory]] of western Greece in northwestern [[Acarnania]], at the mouth of the Sinus Ambracius ([[Gulf of Arta]]) opposite [[Nicopolis]], built by [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] on the north side of the strait.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/occc-encyclopedia/actium&lt;/ref&gt;

On the promontory was an ancient temple of [[Apollo|Apollo Actius]], which was enlarged by Augustus, who, to memorialize the [[Battle of Actium]], instituted or renewed the quinquennial games known as [[Actia]] or [[Ludi]] Actiaci. Actiaca Aera was a computation of time from the battle. There was on the promontory a small town, or rather village, also called Actium.

==History==
[[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Actium]]]]
Actium belonged originally to the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]ian [[colonists]] of Anactorium, who probably founded the [[worship]] of Apollo Actius and the Actia games; in the 3rd century BC it fell to the [[Acarnanians]], who subsequently held their synods there. Actium is chiefly famous as the site of [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian's]] decisive victory over [[Mark Antony]] (September 2, 31 BC). This battle ended a long series of ineffectual operations. It was the Naval [[Battle of Actium]]. The final conflict was provoked by Antony, who is said to have been persuaded by his lover, the queen [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt|of Egypt]], to retire to her land and give battle to mask his retreat; but lack of provisions and the growing demoralization of his [[army]] would eventually account for this decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehistory.osu.edu/world/articles/ArticleView.cfm?AID=16&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient Roman festival, [[Actia]], was named after Actium, in Nicopolis, the new city (today [[Preveza]], Greece). Since 2002, Actium is linked with [[Preveza]] on the north shore of the [[Ambracian Gulf]] by the [[Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel]], or [[Aktio-Preveza Immersed Tunnel]] (traffic labels). Also during Summer of 2009 archaeologists discovered in Actium the ruins of the Temple of Apollo (in Greek Ναός του Ακτίου Απόλλωνος) and founted two statues heads, one of Apollo, one of Artemis (Diana).&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Harry Gouvas:History of Preveza Prefecture, 2009, ISBN 978-960-87328-2-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos, friends since school days, had been business partners in various endeavors including a hamburger stand, air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949 they were introduced by Neil Maaskant (Van Andel's second cousin) to the ''Nutrilite Products'' Corporation. [[Nutrilite]] was a California-based direct sales company founded by Dr. [[Carl Rhenborg]], developer of the first [[multivitamin]] marketed in the United States. In August 1949, after a night-long talk, DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for Nutrilite food supplements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Conn|first= Charles Paul|title= The Possible Dream: A Candid Look At Amway|authorlink=Charles Paul Conn|publisher= [[Revell]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0800708571}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. Shortly thereafter, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their ''sponsor'', they traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar. The meeting was at a downtown hotel, with over a hundred people in attendance. After seeing promotional filmstrips and listening to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business opportunity with enthusiasm. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop their new business further.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed '''Ja-Ri Corporation''' (abbreviated from their respective first names) for importing wooden goods from South American countries; after their trip to the Nutrilite seminar, they dropped{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!---Sold?---&gt; this business and Ja-Ri became their Nutrilite distributorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Van Andel|first= Jay|title= An Enterprising Life|authorlink=Jay Van Andel|publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-88730-997-6|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite also offered commission on the sales of products by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system today known as [[multi-level marketing]] or [[network marketing]]. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of over 5,000 distributors. However, following concerns about the stability of Nutrilite, in April 1959 they and some of their top distributors formed ''The American Way Association'' to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Robinson|first= James W.|title= Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It Means to You|publisher= [[Prima Publishing]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0761510885|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first product was called ''Frisk'', a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Concentrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

===International expansion===
Amway expanded overseas to Australia in 1971, to Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to Russia in 2005, and to Vietnam in 2008.

===Quixtar===
In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named [[Alticor]], and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) [[Internet]]-focused company named [[Quixtar]], [[Access Business Group]], and ''Pyxis Innovations''. Pyxis, later replaced by [[Fulton Innovation]], pursued research and development and [[Access Business Group]] handled manufacturing and logistics, for Amway, Quixtar, and third party clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007706130458 Amway marque to be revived; Quixtar label scrapped]&lt;/ref&gt;

After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. The main difference was that all distributors, now called ''Independent Business Owners'' (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the internet, rather than from their upline &quot;direct distributor&quot;, and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world, and the home of the [[Orlando Magic]] was named the [[Amway Arena]] in 2005. The Orlando Magic is owned by Amway founder [[Richard DeVos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=N.B.A. Orlando Team Sold |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED8163AF933A1575AC0A967958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1991-09-20 |accessdate=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Quixtar published ''The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan'', in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for &quot;Active&quot; IBOs was $115.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf Quixtar.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18 to 24 month period in favor of a unified Amway brand worldwide. That name is Amway Global.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Global markets==
In 2008 two thirds of Amway's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia and India markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 Amway Parent hits 50th year running recording 15% sales growth]&lt;/ref&gt; Amway India sales grew 40% to 1128 [[crore]] (US$230million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingupdate.com/news/amway-india-records-turnover-rs1128-crore-2008-4990.html Amway India records turnover of Rs.1128 crore in 2008]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amway China===
Amway grew quickly in China from its market launch in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal [[pyramid schemes]] led to riots, the Chinese Government enacted a ban on all [[direct selling]] companies, including Amway.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chinese officials ban direct marketing&quot;, April 22, 1998 ''[[Associated Press]]'', The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiations, some companies like Amway, [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]], and [[Mary Kay]] continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Once-barred Amway becomes booming business in China&quot;, Leslie Chang, March 12, 2003,  ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. At the time they had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2 billion in annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/business/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/business-3/116693763565130.xml&amp;coll=7 &quot;Amway, Mary Kay get long-awaited direct-selling licenses in China&quot;] Rob Kirkbride, December 24, 2006, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked #88 by Forbes magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesWomen&quot;&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/11/biz_powerwomen08_Eva-Cheng_34MT.html Forbes' The 100 Most Powerful Women; #88 Eva Cheng]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of ¥17 billion (US$2.5billion).&lt;ref name=LevinD&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Dan|title=Amway's China Redux|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:msGs9qx1urAJ:www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html+2008+Amway+China+28%25+growth&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brands==
Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent [[SA8 (detergent)|SA8]] added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line [[Artistry (cosmetics)|Artistry]] (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India &amp; the US , as well as Nutrilite organic farms in [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]] and [[The United States]] ([[California]] &amp; [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]). In addition, Amway affiliates market products from hundreds of other manufacturers offering everything from books (e.g. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], North America) to wine (World of Wine, Europe).&lt;ref name=forbes2001/&gt;

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product [[LOC]], [[SA8]] laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent, scoring 99 out of a possible 100 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/cooking-cleaning/laundry-detergents-1-07/overview/0107_soap_ov.htm Consumer Reports - Laundry Detergents]&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports did, however, criticise SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= Rob Kirkbride / The Grand Rapids Press|title=Amway's old reliable cleans up|publisher= Grand Rapids Press, The (MI)|page=A1 |date= December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested. Consumer Reports program manager Pat Slaven recommended against buying the products because consumers can &quot;go to the grocery store and get something that performs a whole lot better for a whole lot less money.&quot;&lt;ref name=Odonnell2011&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Donnell|first= Jayne|title=Multilevel marketing or 'pyramid?'

==Ditto Delivery==
Amway owns a patent on the online shopping method of Ditto Delivery, which allows consumers to specify an automatic monthly delivery of each product.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7359871}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2001, Ditto Delivery accounted for 30% of Quixtar's North American sales.&lt;ref name=forbes2001&gt;{{cite news|last=Bannan|first=Karen J|title=Amway.com |url=http://www.forbes.com/best/2001/0625/040.html |accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper= [[Forbes Magazine]]|date=June 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Amway combines [[direct selling]] with a [[network marketing]] strategy. IBOs may market products directly to potential customers and may also recruit (sponsor) and train other people to become IBOs themselves. Each IBO may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xardel&quot;/&gt; People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=429008 Amway in China: factory in Guangzhou]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial Sponsorships==
===Orlando Arena naming rights===
In December 2006, Alticor secured the naming rights for the 17,000-seat basketball arena in [[Orlando, Florida]] – home of the [[Orlando Magic]], which are owned by the family of [[Rich DeVos]]. The arena, formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre, is now called [[Amway Arena]].

===San Jose Earthquakes===
Prior to the [[2009 Major League Soccer season]], Amway Global signed a three-year deal with the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] to become the team's official jersey sponsor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A major part of the partnership is focused on community initiatives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. As a result, Amway Global is now also the official sponsor of the team's ''Kicks for Kids'' program that focuses on fitness and healthy lifestyles, as well as bringing underprivileged children to Earthquakes games.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The partnership also saw the creation of the Amway Global Street Team, which appears at all Earthquakes home games and at a number of soccer and non-soccer events throughout the Bay Area. The members of the Amway Global Street Team give away Earthquakes-branded merchandise and provide soccer skills demonstrations at each event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=San Jose Earthquakes Media Relations |title=Quakes, Amway Global reach sponsorship deal |url=http://sjearthquakes.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20090127&amp;content_id=214090&amp;vkey=news_sje&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=t110 |accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and culture==
=== Political Causes===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the [[Republican Party]] (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the 1994 political campaign of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor [[Sue Myrick]] (N.C.).&lt;ref name=burstein&gt;{{cite web| title = She Did it Amway | author = Rachel Burstein | publisher = [[Mother Jones]]| date = September/October 1996 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway| accessdate = 2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to two reports by [[Mother Jones]] magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager “used the company’s extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871” to Myrick’s campaign.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=zibrowski&gt;{{cite web| title = Tough sell| author = John Zibrowski, Jenna Ziman | publisher = [[Mother Jones]]| date = Nov-Dec 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/tough-sell| accessdate = 2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained “close ties to Amway and Yager”, and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, “most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors”, in the 1997-98 election cycle.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election--$2.5 million to the RNC—and was the number one corporate political donor in the U.S.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; In the 2004 election cycle, the organization contributed a total of $4,000,000 to a conservative [[527 group]], [[Progress for America]].&lt;ref&gt;From opensecrets.org: [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&amp;cycle=2004&amp;format=&amp;tname=Progress+for+America Progress for America - Top Contributors, 2004 Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1996, Amway co-founder [[Richard DeVos]] was honored at a $3 million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3 million to pay for Republican &quot;infomercials&quot; and televising of the GOP convention on Pat Robertson's Family Channel, but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vlasic | first = Bill  | coauthors = Mary Beth Regan | title = Amway II: The Kids take over | work = [[BusinessWeek]]  | date = February 16, 1998 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3565099.arc.htm?chan=search  | accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1997 Richard DeVos and his wife, Helen, gave $1 million to the [[Republican National Committee]],&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic/&gt; which at the time was the second-largest soft-money donation ever, behind Amway's 1994 gift of $2.5 million to the RNC.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt; In July 1997, Senate Majority leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich slipped a last-minute provision into a hotly contested compromise tax bill that granted the DeVos family’s company, Amway, a tax break on its Asian branches, saving it $19 million.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

In a column published in the [[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] newspaper in August 1997,&lt;ref name=Ivins&gt;{{cite news|last=Ivins|first=Molly|title=Congress distributes a tax break to Amway|url=|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=August 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; reporter Molly Ivins wrote that Amway had &quot;its own caucus in Congress...Five Republican House members are also Amway distributors: Reps. Sue Myrick of North Carolina, [[Jon Christensen]] of Nebraska, [[Dick Chrysler]] of Michigan, Richard Rombo of California, and [[John Ensign]] of Nevada.

A 1998 analysis of campaign contributions conducted by [[Businessweek]] found that Amway, along with the founding families and some top distributors, had donated at least $7 million to GOP causes in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=vlasic/&gt; Political candidates who received campaign funding from Amway in 1998 included Representatives [[Bill Redmond]] (R-N.M.), [[Heather Wilson]] (R-N.M.), and Jon Christensen (R-Neb).&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

According to a report by the [[Center for Public Integrity]], in the 2004 election cycle, members of the Van Andel and DeVos families were the second, third and fifth largest donors to the Republican party.&lt;ref name=MediaTransparency&gt;{{cite web|last=Houle|first=Dana|title=Bush Authoritarianism: Blackwater+Amway=GOP, Pt. 3|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/10/21/400840/-Bush-Authoritarianism:-Blackwater+AmwayGOP,-Pt-3|work=|date = October 21, 2007| publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[David G. Bromley]] calls Amway a ''quasi-religious corporation'' having [[sectarian]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;bromley-quasi-religious&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Transformative movements and quasi-religious corporations: the case of Amway'', by [[David G. Bromley]]. In ''Sacred Companies: Organizational Aspects of Religion and Religious Aspects of Organizations'', edited by Nicholas Jay Demerath, [[Peter Dobkin Hall]], Terry Schmitt and [[Rhys H. Williams]], pages 349-363. [[Oxford University Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Bromley and [[Anson Shupe]] view Amway as preaching the [[Prosperity theology|Gospel of Prosperity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rebottling the Elixir: The Gospel of Prosperity in America's Religioeconomic Corporations'', by [[David G.

[[Transaction Publishers]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, of the consulting firm Thinkalytics, LLC, reasoned that although some critics have referred to organizations such as Amway as &quot;cults&quot; and have speculated that they engage in &quot;mind control&quot;, there are other explanations that could account for the behavior of distributors. Namely, continued involvement of distributors despite minimal economic return may result from social satisfaction compensating for diminished economic satisfaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhattacharye-mehta&quot;&gt;''Socialization in network marketing organizations: is it cult behavior?'' by Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, Journal of Socio-Economics. 29(4):361-374.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyramid scheme accusations===
Amway has several times been accused of being a [[pyramid scheme]]. A 1979 FTC investigation in the United States (see below), a 1997 Belgian court&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Cross|first= Wilbur|title= Amway: The true Story of the company that transformed the lives of millions|publisher= [[Berkley Books]] |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-425-17040-3|page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2008 court judgement in the United Kingdom all dismissed these claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mlive.com/grpress/2008/05/uk_dismisses_claims_against_am.html U.K. judge dismisses claims against Amway]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard Business S chool]] of Leadership, which described Amway as “one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world&quot;, noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos:

:''“...accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors. DeVos was an extremely charismatic speaker and used this ability to mobilize and motivate Amway distributors.”''&lt;ref name=HarvardBS&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=American Business Leaders of the Tweintieth Century -- Richard M.

DeVos responded to the pyramid scheme accusations about Amway in a 2009 interview with [[Grand Rapids Press]] reporter Chris Knape.&lt;ref name=Knape&gt;{{cite news|last=Knape|first=Chris|title=At 83, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos prepares company's third generation, addresses church, gay-marriage concerns|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/05/at_83_amway_cofounder_richard.html|accessdate=May 18, 2011|newspaper=[[Grand Rapids Press]]|date=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:Knape: “''Amway has been accused of being a pyramid scheme, of tax evasion and a host of other things. How much of the problems Amway has had over the years can you attribute to the decisions that you made or Jay Van Andel made''?”
:DeVos: “''We failed to come down hard enough, quick enough, to stamp that sort of thing out. That was a sin of omission. We failed to discipline the organization''.”

====FTC investigation====
{{Main|In re Amway Corp.}}
In a 1979 ruling,&lt;ref name=&quot;MLMLAW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/other/dvimf16.htm#N_19_ &quot;Pyramid Schemes&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found that Amway does not qualify as a [[pyramid scheme]] because distributors were not paid to recruit people and had to sell products to get bonus checks, and the company was committed to buying back its distributors' excess inventory.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|title=The Mess Called Multi-Level Marketing With celebrities setting the bait, hundreds of pyram id-style sales companies are raking in millions, often taking in the gullible|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2767|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper= [[CNN Money]] |date= June 1, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The FTC did, however, find Amway &quot;guilty of price-fixing and making exaggerated income claims&quot;;&lt;ref name=Wharton&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Amway: Selling the Dream of Financial Freedom|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2767|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper= [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]|date= May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company was ordered to stop retail price fixing and allocating customers among distributors and was prohibited from misrepresenting the amount of profit, earnings or sales its distributors are likely to achieve with the business. Amway was ordered to accompany any such statements with the actual averages per distributor, pointing out that more than half of the distributors do not make any money, with the average distributor making less than $100 per month. The order was violated with a 1986 ad campaign, resulting in a $100,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casewatch.org/ftc/news/1986/amway.shtml ''Amway Corp.

====Amway Andhra Pradesh (India)====
In September 2006, following a public complaint, [[Andhra Pradesh]] state police (CID) initiated raids and seizures against Amway distributors in the state, and submitted a petition against them, claiming the company violated the ''Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (banning) Act''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ban on Amway Chits, Schemes&quot;&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/17/stories/2008091754250400.htm Ban on Amway Chits, Schemes]&lt;/ref&gt; They shut down all offices of firm Amway, and Arijit Saha writes that &quot;with it the fate of 80,000 distributors of the company has been indefinitely sealed&quot;. The enforcement said that the business model of the company is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hyderabad-police-shuts-down-amway-offices_242899.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibtimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/20061213/amway-mlm-business-model.htm|title=Amway in hot water in Hyderabad over &quot;business model&quot; controversy|last=Saha|first=Arijit |date=13 December 2006|publisher=IB Times|accessdate=17 January 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had notified the police that Amway in India may be violating certain laws regarding a &quot;money circulation scheme&quot; and the [[International Business Times|IB Times]] article writes that &quot;some say ... Amway is really more about making money from recruiting people to become distributors, as opposed to selling products.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibtimes&quot;/&gt; The complaint was initiated following a dowry dispute between a local man and his wife, an Amway distributor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amway Back&quot;&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2047951.cms Indiatimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Following a petition by Amway, the state High Court issued an injunction against the CID and stated the Act did not ''prima facie'' apply,&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2047951.cms Amway back to business in state]&lt;/ref&gt; however after Amway requested the CID petition be dismissed the High Court declared that if police allegations were true, Amway's [[India]]n subsidiary would be in violation of the act and the investigation should continue. On August 14, 2007, the Supreme Court of India ordered the state police to complete the investigation against Amway in 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/20090112071926/http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?tp=on&amp;autono=26541 SC asks Andhra to finish Amway probe in 6 mths]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, citing the High Court decision, the Andhra Pradesh state government enacted a ban on Amway media advertisements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ban on Amway Chits, Schemes&quot;/&gt; Amway challenged the ban and in July 2009 the AP High Court refused a petition the ban should be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/stay-order-against-former-ghmc-chief-174 No Direction on Amway Ads]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June, 2009 the original 2006 CID case was still pending at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/hc-no-stay-raju-questioning-289 Writ Against Amway]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Class Action Settlement====

On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56 million - $34 million in cash and $22 million in products - to settle a class action that had been filed in Federal District Court in California in 2007. The class action, which had been brought against Quixtar and several of its top-level distributors, alleged fraud, racketeering, and that the defendants operated as an illegal pyramid scheme. While noting that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability, Amway acknowledged that it had made changes to its business operations as a result of the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which is expected in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/amway_agrees_to_pay_56_million.html#incart_mce Knape, Chris, &quot;Amway agrees to pay $56 million, settle case alleging it operates a 'pyramid scheme'&quot;, ''Grand Rapids Press'' (November 4, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The economic value of the settlement, including the changes Amway made to its business model, totals $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/lawyers_say_their_20_million_p.html &quot;Lawyers say their $20 million payment is fair for $100 million settlement in Amway pyramid scheme lawsuit&quot;, ''Grand Rapids Press'' (November 4, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian tax case===
In 1983, Amway pleaded guilty to criminal [[tax evasion]] and [[Customs (tax)|customs]] [[fraud]] in Canada, resulting in a fine of $25 million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in Canada at the time. In 1989 the company settled the outstanding customs duties for $45 million CAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In a 1994 interview, Amway co-founder Rich DeVos stated that this incident had been his greatest &quot;moral or spiritual challenge&quot;, first in &quot;soul searching as to whether they had done anything wrong&quot; and then for pleading guilty for technical reasons, despite believing they were innocent of the charges. DeVos stated he believed that the case had been motivated by &quot;political reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-4-number-5/capitalism-compassion Capitalism with Compassion, ''Religion and Liberty'',''Volume 4'',''Number 5'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===RIAA lawsuit===
The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1996, alleging that copyrighted music was used on &quot;highly profitable&quot; training videotapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4D61339F932A15751C0A960958260 Record Labels Sue Amway over its videos]&lt;/ref&gt; Amway denied wrongdoing, blaming the case on a misunderstanding by distributors, and settled the case out of court for $9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19783607.html Amway pays $9 million to settle copyright infringement suit]&lt;/ref&gt; In a related lawsuit initiated by the distributors involved, the Court established that Mahaleel Lee Luster, who had been contracted to make the videotapes, had violated copyright without the knowledge of three of the five of those distributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf ''Foley v Luster'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procter &amp; Gamble===
Some Amway distributors were involved with an [[urban legend]] that the (old) [[Procter &amp; Gamble#Logo controversy|Procter &amp; Gamble service mark]] was in fact a [[Satanism|Satanic]] symbol or that the CEO of P&amp;G is himself a practicing [[Satanist]].

===''Welcome to Life'' (Poland)===
In 1997, Amway Poland and [[Network TwentyOne]] separately sued the makers of a Polish film ''Welcome to Life'' for defamation and copyright violations. The director and producer were later acquitted on the charge of disseminating false information.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiadomosci.wp.pl&quot;&gt;http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1345,title,Przerazajacy-film-o-praniu-mozgow-nie-w-Warszawie,wid,11589486,wiadomosc.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ban on Film Has Poland Debating Censorship|first=Jane|last=Perlez|work=The New York Times|location=Warsaw|date=June 14, 1998|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/world/ban-on-film-has-poland-debating-censorship.html?pagewanted=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, banned for 12 years, was one of the highly anticipated movies of 2009's Warsaw Film Festival and was dubbed in the press as a &quot;scary movie about brainwashing&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiadomosci.wp.pl&quot;/&gt; that depicts hard-sell &quot;[[pep rallies]]&quot; and distributors stating meetings were operated similar to the [[Communist Party]] and methods of recruitment that confusingly resembled those of a sect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plejada.pl/2,24876,news,1,1,witajcie-w-zyciu-film-o-amwayu-wycofany-z-wff,artykul.html&lt;/ref&gt; A best-seller on the local video [[black market]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban on Film Has Poland Debating Censorship|first=Jane|last=Perlez|work=The New York Times|location=Warsaw|date=June 14, 1998|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/world/ban-on-film-has-poland-debating-censorship.html?pagewanted=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was banned while the suit proceeded.

===Dr. Phil and Shape Up===
In March 2004, TV personality [[Phil McGraw]] (aka Dr. Phil) pulled his “Shape Up” line of supplements off the market in the face of an investigation by the [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). The supplements were manufactured by CSA Nutraceuticals, a subsidiary of Alticor’s Access Business Group.&lt;ref name=Dembling&gt;{{cite book|last= Sophia Dembling and Lisa Gutierrez|first=|title=The making of Dr. Phil: the straight-talking true story of everyone's|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=|isbn=|pages=181|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC later dropped the probe; however, in October 2005, a [[class-action lawsuit]] was filed against McGraw by several people who used the products and claimed that the supplements, which cost $120 per month, did not stimulate weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/|title=Class-action status sought in Dr. Phil diet suit|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=CTV Globe Media|year=2005|author=CTV.ca News Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, a $10.5 million settlement was reached, in which Alticor agreed to provide $4.5 million in cash and $6 million in Nutrilite products to disgruntled users of Shape Up.&lt;ref name=&quot;usaap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-26-dr-phil-diet_x.htm|title=Settlement reached on Dr. Phil diet plan|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=[[USA Today]] - [[Associated Press]]|agency=Associated Press | date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===
In 2004, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investgation of business practices within the Amway organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;DATELINE&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the “high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar [Amway]” are actually “making most of their money by selling motivational books tapes and seminars; not Quixtar’s cosmetics, soaps, and electronics.”

:“''In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don’t get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can’t sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed''.”

It was also revealed that an Amway recruiter featured in the report (Chris Fredericks) made misleading and inconsistent statements about Amway earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding [[arrest warrant]] for [[drug dealing]].&lt;ref name=DATELINE/&gt; 

Some Amway distributor groups have been accused of using [[cult]]-like tactics to attract new distributors and keep them involved and committed.&lt;ref name=&quot;butterfield&quot;&gt;''Amway: the cult of free enterprise'', by Stephen Butterfield, [[South End Press]], 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;samways&quot;&gt;''Dangerous persuaders'' by [[Louise Samways]].

'''Adam Smith''' ([[Baptism|baptised]] 16 June 1723&amp;nbsp;– died 17 July 1790 {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Old Style|OS]]: 5 June 1723&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1790&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}) was a Scottish [[Ethics|social philosopher]] and a pioneer of [[political economy]]. One of the key figures of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], Smith is the author of ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' and ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. The latter, usually abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of [[economics]]. It earned him an enormous reputation and would become one of the most influential works on economics ever published. Smith is widely cited as the father of modern economics and [[capitalism]]. 
 
Smith studied [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at [[Glasgow]] teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith returned home and spent the next ten years writing ''The Wealth of Nations'', publishing it in 1776. He died in 1790.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Smith was born to Margaret Douglas at [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], Scotland. His father, also named Adam Smith, was a [[lawyer]], [[civil servant]], and [[widower]] who married Margaret Douglas in 1720 and died two months before Smith was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact date of Smith's birth is unknown, his baptism was recorded on &lt;!-- 5 June is OS; 5 June is NS --&gt;5 June 1723 at Kirkcaldy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though few events in Smith's early childhood are known, Scottish journalist and Smith's biographer [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]] recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of four and released when others went to rescue him.{{#tag:ref|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes, &quot;In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 5&quot; /&gt;|group=N}} Smith was close to his mother, who likely encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Burgh School of Kirkcaldy]]—characterised by Rae as  &quot;one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period&quot;—from 1729 to 1737.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Smith studied [[Latin]], [[mathematics]], [[history]], and [[writing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 39&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Kirkcaldy High Street Adam Smith Plaque.png|thumb|upright|left|A commemorative plaque for Smith is located at Smith's home town of [[Kirkcaldy]].|alt=A plaque of Smith]]

===Formal education===
Smith entered the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was fourteen and studied [[moral philosophy]] under [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 39&quot; /&gt; Here, Smith developed his passion for [[liberty]], [[reason]], and [[free speech]]. In 1740, Smith was awarded the [[Snell exhibition]] and left to attend [[Balliol College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow far superior to that at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], which he found intellectually stifling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: &quot;In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.&quot;
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of [[David Hume|David Hume's]] ''[[Treatise on Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently  confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 24&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Robert Scott, &quot;The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=8122418309 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Oxford library.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 24–25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his time at Oxford, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 42&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 12&quot; /&gt;

===Teaching career===
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] under the patronage of [[Lord Kames]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lecture topics included [[rhetoric]] and ''[[belles-lettres]]'', and later the subject of &quot;the progress of opulence&quot;. On this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of &quot;the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]&quot;. While Smith was not adept at [[public speaking]], his lectures met with success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Hume.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[David Hume]] was a friend and contemporary of Smith.|alt=A man posing for a painting]]

In 1750, he met the philosopher [[David Hume]], who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |month=September |year=2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|head of Moral Philosophy]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 43&quot;/&gt; He worked as an academic for the next thirteen years, which he characterized as &quot;by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined &quot;sympathy&quot; as the feeling of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He bases his explanation not on a special &quot;moral sense&quot;, as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on sympathy. Following the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labor, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated [[Western Europe]]an economic policies at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:François Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[François Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[physiocrats|Physiocratic school of thought]]|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position, and he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term, but his students refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutoring and travels===
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott while teaching him subjects including proper Polish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 16&quot; /&gt; He was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]300 per year plus expenses along with £300 per year pension, which was roughly twice his former income as a teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 16&quot; /&gt; Smith first travelled as a tutor to [[Toulouse|Toulouse, France]], where he stayed for a year and a half.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 16&quot; /&gt; According to accounts, he found Toulouse to be very boring, and he wrote to Hume that he &quot;had begun to write a book to pass away the time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 16&quot; /&gt; After touring the south of France, the group moved to [[Geneva]], where Smith met with the philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After staying in Geneva, the party went to Paris, where Smith came to know intellectual leaders such as [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Jean D'Alembert]], [[André Morellet]], [[Helvétius]] and, in particular, [[François Quesnay]], the head of the [[physiocrats|Physiocratic school]], whose ideas impressed him&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that he considered dedicating Quesnay his ''The Wealth of Nations'' had Quesnay not died earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, January 21, and March 18, 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The physiocrats opposed [[mercantilism]], the dominating economic theory at the time, by taking up the motto [[Laissez-faire|Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!]] (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!). They also declared that only agriculture produced wealth, and that merchants and manufacturers did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 17&quot; /&gt; But this, their praising nature, and a natural style of life was a necessary smoke screen, because criticising openly the consumption pattern of nobility and church – the only clients merchants and manufacturers had&lt;ref&gt;During the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] population shrunk by 4 millions and agriculture by one-third, but taxes increased; Cusminsky, Rosa, de Cendrero, 1967, ''Los Fisiócratas'', Buenos Aires: Centro Editor de América Latina, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] ruined France by lost wars,&lt;ref&gt;1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, 1688–1797 War of the Grand Alliance, 1672–1678 Franco-Dutch War, 1667–1668 War of Devolution, 1618–1648 Thirty Years' War.&lt;/ref&gt; help to the American insurgents against the British, and above all the excessive consumption of [[Unproductive labour in economic theory|unproductive labour]] – labour which does not contribute to economic reproduction – would have been lethal. And if nobility and church are disposable for economic reproduction including those who work for them, in feudal France agriculture was the only sector important to maintain the society. As English distribution of income differed sharply from French, this was not fully understood by Adam Smith who concluded that their teachings are &quot;with all its imperfections [perhaps] the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. 2b, pp. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction of productive versus [[Unproductive labour in economic theory|unproductive labour]] – the physiocratic ''classe steril'' –  became the central issue to the development approach of classical economics.

===Later years===
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 17&quot; /&gt; Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he befriended [[Henry Moyes]], a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. As well as teaching Moyes, Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and [[Thomas Reid]] in the young man's education.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] to [[Thomas Creevey]]'', 24 February 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a member of the [[Literary Club]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Rae/raeLS10.html |title=First Visit to London |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in [[Panmure House]] in Edinburgh's Canongate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, he became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1787 to 1789 he occupied the honorary position of Lord [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness and was buried in the [[Canongate Kirkyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his death bed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist [[Joseph Black]], and the pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buchan 2006 25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;buchan 2006 88&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned an early unpublished ''History of Astronomy'' as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as ''[[Essays on Philosophical Subjects]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;buchan 2006 25&quot; /&gt;

Smith's library went by his will to [[David Douglas, Lord Reston]] (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith.  It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Rev. W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor [[Robert Oliver Cunningham]] of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death the remaining books were sold.  On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879 her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church), Edinburgh.

==Personality and beliefs==
===Character===
[[File:Smith medallion portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|[[James Tassie]]'s enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|pp=xx–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=An enamel paste medallion, depicting a man's head facing the right]]

Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.&lt;ref name=&quot;buchan 2006 88&quot; /&gt; He never married,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before his own death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith, who is often described as a prototypical [[absent-minded professor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;skousen 2001 32&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Skousen|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered by historians to have been an eccentric but benevolent intellectual, comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of &quot;inexpressible benignity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to talk to himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 53&quot; /&gt; a habit that began during his childhood when he would speak to himself and smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.&lt;ref name=&quot;skousen 2001 32&quot; /&gt; He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussing-Burks 2003 53&quot; /&gt; and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.&lt;ref name=&quot;skousen 2001 32&quot; /&gt;

Various anecdotes have discussed his absent-minded nature. In one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a [[tanning]] factory, and while discussing [[free trade]], Smith walked into a huge [[tanning|tanning pit]] from which he needed help to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another episode records that he put bread and butter into a teapot, drank the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. In another example, Smith went out walking and daydreaming in his nightgown and ended up {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside town before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;skousen 2001 32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 14&quot; /&gt;

===Religious views===
There has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had a strong interest in [[Christianity]] and belonged to the moderate wing of the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fact that he received the Snell Exhibition, Smith may have also moved to England with the intention of pursuing a career in the [[Church of England]]. At Oxford, Smith rejected Christianity and it is generally believed that he returned to Scotland as a [[deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Times obituary of Adam Smith |journal=[[The Times]] |date=1790-07-24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Ronald Coase]] has challenged the view that Smith was a deist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|pp=529–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that while Smith may have referred to the &quot;[[Great Architect of the Universe]]&quot; in his works, other scholars have &quot;very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based this on analysis of a remark in ''The Wealth of Nations'' where Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the &quot;great phenomena of nature&quot; such as &quot;the generation, the life, growth and dissolution of plants and animals&quot; has led men to &quot;enquire into their causes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hume on religion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coase also notes Smith's observation that &quot;[s]uperstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hume on religion&quot; /&gt;

===''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''===
{{Main|The Theory of Moral Sentiments}}

In 1759, Smith published his first work, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. He continued making extensive revisions to the book, up until his death.{{#tag:ref|The 6 editions of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' were published in 1759, 1761, 1767, 1774, 1781, and 1790 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-01-31 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=192&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Adam Smith, Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 1 The Theory of Moral Sentiments [1759] |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Although ''The Wealth of Nations'' is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, it is believed that Smith himself considered ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' to be a superior work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |title=Biography of Smith |accessdate=2008-05-14 |publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]] |year=1997 |author=Falkner, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgements, in spite of man's natural inclinations towards self-interest. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have traditionally perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasizes sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, most scholars&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Jonathan B. Saving Adam Smith. Upper Saddle River: Prentic-Hall, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel. A History of Economic Thought. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brue, Stanley L, and Randy R Grant. The Evolution of Economic Thought. Mason: Thomson Higher Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists.&lt;ref&gt;There is at least one clear contradiction between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations: The gluttony of the landlords is in the former an &quot;invisible hand&quot; which helps the poor to partake in the landlord's wealth. In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; it is seen as the consumption of unproductive labour, limiting the growth of wealth.&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the &quot;impartial spectator&quot; as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathize with them. Rather than viewing ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, most Smith scholars regard the works as emphasizing different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. ''The Wealth of Nations'' draws on situations where man's morality is likely to play a smaller role, such as the laborer involved in pin-making, whereas ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' focuses on situations where man's morality is likely to play a dominant role among more personal exchanges.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

These views ignore that Smith's visit to France (1764–66) changed radically his former views and that ''The Wealth of Nations'' is an inhomogeneous convolute of his former lectures and of what [[François Quesnay|Quesnay]] taught him.&lt;ref&gt;Cannan, Edwin (ed.), 1937, p. xxxix, Editor's Introduction, pp. xxxviii–xli to: Adam Smith, &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot;, N. Y.: Random House; &quot;These changes [to the earlier lectures by his visit to France] do not make so much real difference to Smith's own work as might be supposed; the theory of distribution, thought it appears in the title of Book I., is no essential part of the work and could easily be excised … But to subsequent [classical] economics they were of fundamental importance. They settled the form of economic treatises for a century at least.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Before his voyage to France in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Adam Smith refers to an &quot;invisible hand&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1982 [1759], &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiment&quot;, pp. 184–5 in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. i&quot;, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which procures that the gluttony of the rich helps the poor as the stomach of rich is so limited that they have to spend their fortune on servants. After his visit to France, Smith considers in the ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) the gluttony of the rich as [[Unproductive labour in economic theory|unproductive labour]]. The micro-economical/psychological view in the tradition of [[Aristotle]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Puffendorf]] and [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The learned will at once discern how much … is taken from the writings of others, from Cicero and Aristotle, and to name no other moderns, from Puffendorf's … de officio hominis et civis&quot; (Hutcheson, F., 1787, &quot;A Short Introduction to Moral Philosophy&quot;, Dublin: McKenzie, p. vii.). In &quot;System&quot; (1755), Hutcheson's begins stating: &quot;The intention of moral philosophy is to direct men to that course of action which tends most effectually to promote their greatest happiness and perfection.&quot; (Hutcheson, F., 1755, &quot;A system of moral philosophy&quot;, Glasgow: Foulis). In &quot;Inquiry&quot;, Hutcheson (1729, 180) explains: &quot;That action is best, which procures the greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers&quot; (Hutcheson, F., 1729, &quot;An inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue&quot;, London).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's teacher, – elements compatible with a neoclassical theory – chanced to the macro-economical view of the classical theory Smith learned in France.{{clarify|date=December 2010}}

[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]

There is a fundamental dissent between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's [[invisible hand]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. 2a, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – book IV, chapter II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme how to promote the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; in the first sentences.

Smith used the term &quot;[[invisible hand|the invisible hand]]&quot; in &quot;History of Astronomy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1980, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 3, p. 49, edited by W.P.D. Wightman and J.C. Bryce, Oxford: Claredon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to &quot;the invisible hand of Jupiter&quot; and twice – each time with a different meaning – the term &quot;[[invisible hand|an invisible hand]]&quot;: in [[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 1, p. 184-5, edited by D.D. Raphael and A.L. Macfie, Oxford: Claredon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1759) and in ''The Wealth of Nations''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456, edited by R.H. Cambell and A.S. Skinner, Oxford: Claredon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1776). This last statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;the invisible hand&quot; in numerous ways. It is therefore important to read the original:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestick industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, '''neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it'''. By preferring the support of domestiek to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, '''he intends only his own gain, and he is in this''', as in many other eases, '''led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention'''. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. '''By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it'''. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the publick good. [emphasis added].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Wealth of Nations title.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]

Smith's statement about the benefits of &quot;an invisible hand&quot; is certainly meant to answer [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that &quot;Private Vices … may be turned into Public Benefits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest, he indirectly promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their &quot;conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 145, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price &quot;which can be squeezed out of the buyers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith also warned that a true laissez-faire economy would quickly become a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation.  Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants &quot;...in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public...The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gopnik|first=Adam|title=Market Man|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|issue=October 18, 2010|page=82|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its [[General equilibrium theory|General Equilibrium]] concept. [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] &quot;Economics&quot; refers 6 times to Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot;.  To emphasize this relation, Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P. A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, Economics, 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot; statement putting &quot;general interest&quot; where Smith wrote &quot;publick interest&quot;. Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P. A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, idem, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded: &quot;Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.&quot; And it was then when neoclassical economics was revived in Chicago from oblivion and Samuelson entered the scene.

Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Taking up the [[Physiocracy|physiocratical]] concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1. Therefore the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period are regarded as [[Unproductive labor in economic theory|unproductive labor]] as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had learned in France with [[François Quesnay|Quesnay]]. To this French insight that [[Unproductive labor in economic theory|unproductive labor]] should be pushed back to use more labor productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labor should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labor]]. Deepening the division of labor means under competition lower prices and thereby extended markets. Extended markets and increased production lead to a new step of reorganising production and inventing new ways of producing which again lower prices, etc., etc.. Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. It predicted England's evolution as the workshop of the World, underselling all its competitors. The opening sentences of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; summarize this policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labor of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes … . [T]his produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labor is generally applied; and,
* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; offers many insights other theories disagree. It argues that agriculture offers fewer possibilities to a division of labour,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; raising its prices compared with industry. [Us-American and European agriculture is therefore subsidised]. To Smith, the genius and the natural talents of men are no natural dispositions which have to be paid for according to comparative advantages. &quot;It is not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition should reduce the prices of these &quot;talents&quot;. Smith suspects manufacturers of mischief and trusts landowners and labourers – as consumers – to represent the common good. [Ricardo mistrusts landowners as earners of a monopoly income.]

[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]

Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); ''A Treatise on Public Opulence'' (1764) (first published in 1937); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).&lt;ref&gt;The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, 6 volumes;  http://oll.libertyfund.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===In economics and moral philosophy===
''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirized by Tory writers in the moralizing tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-02-11 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title= Adam Smith – Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith &quot;the most important substantive proposition in all of economics&quot; and foundation of  resource-allocation theory. It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labor, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George J. (1976). &quot;The Successes and Failures of Professor Smith,&quot; ''Journal of Political Economy'', 84(6),  p. 1202. P [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1831274 p. 1199]-1213, Also published as Selected Papers,  No. 50 [http://google.com/scholar?q=cache:hs0XwYbafSgJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000000000000 (PDF)], Graduate School of Business,  University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Samuelson]] finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the [[general equilibrium]] modeling of [[Walras]] a century later.  Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention added a realism missed later by Malthus, Ricardo, and Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence-wage theory of labour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul A. (1977). &quot;A Modern Theorist's Vindication of Adam Smith,&quot; ''American Economic Review'', 67(1),  p [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1815879 p. 42.] Reprinted in J.C. Wood, ed., ''Adam Smith: Critical Assessments'', pp. 498–509. [http://books.google.com/books?id=B8FY8mo5zX4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA498=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] dismissed Smith's contributions as unoriginal, saying &quot;His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the &quot;[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]&quot;. Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Capital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roemer&quot;&gt;[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). &quot;Marxian Value Analysis&quot;. ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). &quot;Marx, Karl Heinrich&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economicsv. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labor that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern understanding of [[mainstream economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

The body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; or &quot;[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularized by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for &quot;economic science&quot; and a substitute for the earlier, broader term &quot;[[political economy]]&quot; used by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marshall, Alfred; Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jevons, W. Stanley |year=1879 |edition=2nd |url=http://books.google.com/?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#PPR3,M1 |title=The Theory of Political Economy |page=xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Preagerp. p. 32..&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical economics systematized [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). &quot;Marginalist Economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations''  was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or &quot;economic  man&quot; was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, his opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire{{clarify|date=October 2010}} was emphasized, as were his statements about high wages for the poor, and his views that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the [[Pound sterling|£]]50 notes issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]] in Scotland,&lt;ref name=&quot;clydesdale&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg|title=Clydesdale 50 Pounds, 1981|publisher=Ron Wise's Banknoteworld|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scotbanks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php|title=Current Banknotes : Clydesdale Bank|publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of £20 notes issued by the [[Bank of England]], making him the first Scotsman to feature on an [[Bank of England note issues|English banknote]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |title=Smith replaces Elgar on £20 note |accessdate=2008-05-14 |publisher=BBC | date=2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a {{convert|10|ft}}-tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the [[Royal Mile]] outside [[St Giles' Cathedral]] in Parliament Square, near the [[Mercat cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Smith sculpture to tower over Royal Mile |date=2007-09-26 |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |author=Blackley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century sculptor [[Jim Sanborn]] (best known for the ''[[Kryptos]]'' sculpture at the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work. At [[Central Connecticut State University]] is ''Circulating Capital'', a tall cylinder which features an extract from ''The Wealth of Nations'' on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text but represented in [[binary code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CCSU welcomes a new kid on the block |date=2001-03-13 |author=Fillo, Maryellen |work=[[The Hartford Courant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is ''Adam Smith's Spinning Top''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piece at UNCC is a puzzle for Charlotte, artist says |date=1997-05-20 |author=Kelley, Pam |work=[[Charlotte Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Artist sheds new light on sculpture |date=1997-06-01 |author=Shaw-Eagle, Joanna |work=[[The Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Smith sculpture is at [[Cleveland State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sculpturecenter.org/oosi/sculpture.asp?SID=1055|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050205065104/http://www.sculpturecenter.org/oosi/sculpture.asp?SID=1055|archivedate=2005-02-05 |title=Adam Smith's Spinning Top |publisher=Ohio Outdoor Sculpture Inventory |accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence===

His house on Panmure Close off the [[Canongate]] survived until 1889,&lt;ref&gt;contemporary newspaper records; Scotsman&lt;/ref&gt; but a nearby building of similar age adopted the stance of having been his house (in the same manner as [[John Knox's House]]) erecting a plaque c.1950 proclaiming itself as having been his residence. In reality it was a far grander building than that remaining.

===As a symbol of free market economics===
[[File:Sanborn-CSU.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Adam Smith's Spinning Top'', sculpture by  [[Jim Sanborn]] at [[Cleveland State University]]|alt=A sculpture of an upside down cone]]

Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the [[Adam Smith Institute]], Adam Smith Society&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Adam Smith Society&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070721032612/http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archivedate=2007-07-21 |title=The Adam Smith Society |accessdate=2008-05-24 |publisher=The Adam Smith Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Adam Smith Club,&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Australian Adam Smith Club&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmithclub.org/ |title=The Australian Adam Smith Club |accessdate=2008-10-12 |publisher=Adam Smith Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3748|title=Interview with Milton Friedman|last=Levy|first=David|date=June 1992|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that, while Smith did not coin the term ''[[laissez-faire]]'', &quot;it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions&quot;. Greenspan continues that ''The Wealth of Nations'' was &quot;one of the great achievements in human intellectual history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlFRB: Speech, Greenspan—Adam Smith—6 February 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |title=FRB: Speech, Greenspan—Adam Smith—6 February 2005 |work= |accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. J. O'Rourke]] describes Smith as the &quot;founder of free market economics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlAdam Smith: Web Junkie - Forbes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |title=Adam Smith: Web Junkie - Forbes.com |work= |accessdate=2008-06-10 |date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other writers have argued that Smith's support for ''laissez-faire'' (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. [[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who &quot;wear an Adam Smith necktie&quot; do it to &quot;make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]&quot;, and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith &quot;was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism ... yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.&quot; In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, [[environmentalism]], and &quot;[[sumptuary tax|discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=1994-04-06 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia.]] |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an &quot;extreme dogmatic defender of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown93&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |month=January |year=1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230–232 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2234351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, in this passage Smith goes on to specify progressive, not flat, taxation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik Gopnik, A., op cit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith even specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent. He believed that tax laws should be as transparent as possible and that each individual should pay a &quot;certain amount, and not arbitrary,&quot;  in addition to paying this tax at the time &quot;most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2&quot;/&gt; Smith goes on to state that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Every tax, however, is, to the person who pays it, a badge, not of slavery, but of liberty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p.704&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defense and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods &quot;of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual&quot; such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. he supported public education and religious institutions as providing general benefit to the society. Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because &quot;we naturally expect more splendor in the court  of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was in favor of retaliatory tariffs and believed that they would eventually bring down the price of goods. He even stated in Wealth of Nations:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has argued&lt;ref group=N&gt;See chapters 2, 5, 6, and 10 of his ''Understanding Power'', New Press (February 2002), along with his ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', primarily chapter 1, South End Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; that several aspects of Smith's thought have been misrepresented and falsified by contemporary ideology, including Smith's reasons for supporting markets and Smith's views on corporations. Chomsky argues that Smith supported markets in the belief that they would lead to equality, and that Smith opposed wage labor and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|2002|loc=ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called &quot;natural liberty&quot;) but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viner 1927&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Viner, Jacob|month=April |year=1927|journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]]|volume=35|issue=2|pages=198–232|doi=10.2307/2234351|title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire|last2=Pack|first2=Spencer J.|last3=Werhane|first3=Patricia H.|url=http://jstor.org/stable/2234351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term &quot;free market economics&quot; or &quot;free market economist&quot; to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the &quot;Smithian&quot; identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2008 |title=Toward a Public and Professional Identity for Our Economics |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=358–372 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2009 |title=Desperately Seeking Smithians: Responses to the Questionnaire about Building an Identity |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=113–180 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[David Ricardo]] set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Ideas From Dead Economists&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Buchholz, Todd|month=December |year=1990|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Ideas From Dead Economists&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], ca. 1788]]
Born to a wealthy family in Paris, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations|Collège Mazarin]] in 1754 to 1761, studying [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]]. His education was filled with the ideals of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the time, and he was fascinated by [[Pierre Macquer]]'s dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry was largely influenced by [[Étienne Condillac]], a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. In collaboration with [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]], Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in June 1767. At the age of 25, he was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], France's most elite scientific society, for an essay on [[street lighting]], and in recognition for his earlier research. In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.

In 1771, at the age of 28, Lavoisier married 13-year-old [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]], the daughter of a co-owner of the ''[[Ferme générale]]''. Over time, she proved to be a scientific colleague to her husband. She translated documents from English for him, including [[Richard Kirwan]]'s ''Essay on Phlogiston'' and [[Joseph Priestley]]'s research. She created many [[drawing|sketches]] and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues. She edited and published Lavoisier’s memoirs (whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today) and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eagle |first=Cassandra T. |coauthors=Jennifer Sloan |title=Marie Anne Paulze Lavoisier: The Mother of Modern Chemistry |journal=The Chemical Educator |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1&amp;nbsp;– 18 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x14v35m5n8822v42/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-14 |doi=10.1007/s00897980249a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to chemistry==
===Research on gases, water, and combustion===
[[File:Lavoisier decomposition air.png|thumb|Antoine Lavoisier's famous phlogiston experiment. Engraving by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Mme Lavoisier]] in the 1780s taken from ''Traité élémentaire de chimie'' (Elementary treatise on chemistry)]]

[[File:SeimiKaisouChemistry.jpg|thumb|upright|The work of Lavoisier was translated in Japan in the 1840s, through the process of [[Rangaku]]. Page from [[Udagawa Yōan]]'s 1840 ''Seimi Kaisō'']]

Lavoisier demonstrated the role of oxygen in the rusting of metal, as well as oxygen's role in animal and plant respiration. Working with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Lavoisier conducted experiments that showed that respiration was essentially a slow combustion of organic material using inhaled oxygen. Lavoisier's explanation of combustion disproved the [[phlogiston]] theory, which postulated that materials released a substance called phlogiston when they burned.

Lavoisier discovered that [[Henry Cavendish]]'s &quot;inflammable air&quot;, which Lavoisier had termed ''hydrogen'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for &quot;water-former&quot;), combined with oxygen to produce a dew which, as Joseph Priestley had reported, appeared to be water. In ''&quot;Mémoire sur la combustion en général&quot;'' (&quot;On Combustion in General,&quot; 1777) and ''&quot;Considérations générales sur la nature des acides&quot;'' (&quot;General Considerations on the Nature of Acids,&quot; 1778), he demonstrated that the &quot;air&quot; responsible for combustion was also the source of acidity. In 1779, he named this part of the air &quot;oxygen&quot; (Greek for &quot;becoming sharp&quot; because he claimed that the sharp taste of acids came from oxygen), and the other &quot;[[nitrogen|azote]]&quot; (Greek for &quot;no life&quot;). In ''&quot;Réflexions sur le phlogistique&quot;'' (&quot;Reflections on Phlogiston,&quot; 1783), Lavoisier showed the [[phlogiston theory]] to be inconsistent. But Priestley refused to believe Lavoisier's results even on his death bed in Pennsylvania.

===Pioneer of stoichiometry===
Lavoisier's researches included some of the first truly [[stoichiometry|quantitative chemical experiments]]. He carefully weighed the reactants and products in a chemical reaction, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. He showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if water is heated to steam, if salt is dissolved in water or if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged. His experiments supported the law of [[conservation of mass]], which Lavoisier was the first to state,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwinger&quot; /&gt; although [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments. Others who anticipated the work of Lavoisier include [[Jean Rey (physician)|Jean Rey]] (1583–1645), [[Joseph Black]] (1728–1799), and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731–1810).

===Analytical chemistry and chemical nomenclature===
Lavoisier investigated the composition of water and air, which at the time were considered elements. He determined that the components of water were [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]], and that air was a mixture of gases, primarily [[nitrogen]] and oxygen. With the French chemists [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine Fourcroy]] and [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau|Guyton de Morveau]], Lavoisier devised a [[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic chemical nomenclature]]. He described it in ''Méthode de nomenclature chimique'' (''Method of Chemical Nomenclature'', 1787). This system facilitated communication of discoveries between chemists of different backgrounds and is still largely in use today, including names such as ''sulfuric acid'', ''sulfates'', and ''sulfites''.

Lavoisier's ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie|Traité élémentaire de chimie]]'' (''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry'', 1789, translated into English by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]]) is considered to be the first modern chemistry [[textbook]]. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of [[conservation of mass]], and denied the existence of [[phlogiston]]. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements.

While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for ''Traité élémentaire'' as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication.&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Advertisement,&quot; p. vi of Kerr's translation, and pp. xxvi-xxvii, xxviii of Douglas McKie's introduction to the Dover edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the ''Traité élémentaire'' was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.

===Legacy===
[[File:Calorimeter.gif|thumb|100px|left|Constant [[pressure]] [[calorimeter]], engraving made by madame Lavoisier for [[thermochemistry]] experiments]]
Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the [[chemical balance]], used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous). Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with [[Laplace]]. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of [[carbon dioxide]] produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.

Lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of [[allotropy|allotropy in chemical elements]] when he discovered that [[diamond]] is a [[allotropy|crystalline form of carbon]].

However, much to his professional detriment, Lavoisier discovered no new substances, devised no really novel apparatus, and worked out no improved methods of preparation. He was essentially a theorist, and his great merit lay in the capacity of taking over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced by his own quantitative experiments, of expounding the true explanation of the results. He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.

Overall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Gillespie, Foreword to ''Lavoisier'' by Jean-Pierre Poirier, University of Pennsylvania Press, English Edition, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg|thumb|250px|Lavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration in the 1770s]]

==Contributions to biology==
Lavoisier used a [[calorimeter]] to measure heat production as a result of respiration in a [[guinea pig]]. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of {{nowrap|0°C}} around an inner shell filled with ice. The guinea pig in the center of the chamber produced heat which melted the ice. The water that flowed out of the calorimeter was collected and weighed. Lavoisier used this measurement to estimate the heat produced by the guinea pig's metabolism. Lavoisier concluded, ''&quot;la respiration est donc une combustion,&quot;'' That is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S Is a Calorie a Calorie?] ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', Vol. 79, No. 5, 899S–906S, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and politics==
Lavoisier received a [[law degree]] and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]], but never practiced as a [[lawyer]]. He did become interested in French [[politics]], and at the age of 26 he obtained a position as a [[tax]] collector in the ''[[Ferme Générale]]'', a [[tax farming (France)|tax farming]] company, where he attempted to introduce reforms in the French [[monetary system|monetary]] and [[tax]]ation system to help the peasants. While in government work, he helped develop the [[SI|metric system]] to secure uniformity of [[weights and measures]] throughout France.

==Final days, execution, and aftermath==
[[File:Lavoisier-statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of Lavoisier, at [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]]]]

He was a powerful figure in the deeply unpopular ''[[Ferme Générale]]'', 28 feudal tax collectors who were known  to profit immensely by exploiting their position. Lavoisier was branded a traitor by the [[French Revolution|Assembly under Robespierre]], during the [[Reign of Terror]], in 1794. He had also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], granting them exception to a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=In September 1793 a law was passed ordering the arrest of all foreigners born in enemy countries and all their property to be confiscated. Lavoisier intervened on behalf of Lagrange, who certainly fell under the terms of the law, and he was granted an exception. On 8 May 1794, after a trial that lasted less than a day, a revolutionary tribunal condemned Lavoisier, who had saved Lagrange from arrest, and 27 others to death. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier, who was guillotined on the afternoon of the day of his trial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier was tried, convicted, and guillotined on 8 May in Paris, at the age of 50.

Lavoisier was actually one of the few liberals in his position. One of his actions that may have sealed his fate ([[Ferme_générale#The_Ferme_g.C3.A9n.C3.A9rale_.281726-1790.29|although all tax collectors were executed during the revolution]]) was a clash a few years earlier with the young [[Jean-Paul Marat]] {{or |date=May 2011}} whom he dismissed curtly after being presented with a preposterous &quot;scientific invention&quot; (an object which showed a spectrum of light that was as yet unseen&amp;nbsp;— but did not measure anything).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Marat subsequently became a leading agitator for the extension of the revolutions gains to the 'sans-cullottes' and a Jacobin.

According to a (probably apocryphal) story, the appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge: &quot;La République n'a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes ; le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu.&quot; (''&quot;The Republic needs neither scientists nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed&quot;''.)&lt;ref&gt;
Commenting on this quotation, Denis Duveen, an English expert on Lavoiser and a collector of his works, wrote that &quot;it is pretty certain that it was never uttered.&quot; For Duveen's evidence, see the following: {{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ed031p60 |author=Duveen, Denis I. |title=Antoine Laurent Lavoisier and the French Revolution |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=31 |month=February |issue=2 |year=1954 |pages=60&amp;nbsp;– 65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavoisier's importance to science was expressed by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] who lamented the beheading by saying: ''&quot;Cela leur a pris seulement un instant pour lui couper la tête, mais la France pourrait ne pas en produire une autre pareille en un siècle.&quot;'' (&quot;It took them only an instant to cut off his head, but France may not produce another such head in a century.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Delambre |first=Jean-Baptiste|contribution = Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. le Comte J.-L.

One and a half years following his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. When his private belongings were delivered to his widow, a brief note was included reading &quot;To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted.&quot;

About a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier's head for the statue, but used a spare head of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier's last years. Lack of money prevented alterations being made. The statue was melted down during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and has not since been replaced. However, one of the main &quot;[[lycée]]s&quot; (high schools) in Paris and a street in the [[VIIIe arrondissement|8th arrondissement]] are named after Lavoisier, and statues of him are found on the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] (''photograph, left'') and on the façade of the ''Cour Napoléon'' of the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]].

'''Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe''' (September 27, 1818 &amp;ndash; November 25, 1884) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]].  He never used the first two of his given names, preferring to be known as Hermann Kolbe.

==Life==
Kolbe was born in Elliehausen, near [[Göttingen]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (Germany) as the eldest son of a [[Protestant]] pastor. At the age of 13 he entered the Göttingen Gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors.  He obtained the leaving certificate (the [[Abitur]]) six years later.  He had become passionate about the study of [[chemistry]], matriculating at the [[University of Göttingen]] in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]].

In 1842 he became an assistant to [[Robert Bunsen]] at the [[University of Marburg]]; he took his doctoral degree there in 1843.  A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] at the new [[Museum of Economic Geology]] in London, where he became a close friend of [[Edward Frankland]].  From 1847 he was engaged in editing the ''Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie'' (''Dictionary of Pure and Applied Chemistry'') edited by [[Justus von Liebig]], Wöhler, and [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]], and he also wrote an important textbook.  In 1851 Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg, and in 1865 he was called to the University of [[Leipzig]]. In 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In 1853 he married Charlotte, the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben. His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage.  They had four children.

==Work==
As late as the 1840s, and despite [[Wöhler synthesis|Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea]] in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of [[vitalism]], according to which a special life-force was necessary to create organic compounds. Kolbe developed the idea that [[organic compound]]s could be derived from inorganic ones, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. He validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]], in several steps, to [[acetic acid]] (1843–45). Introducing a modified idea of structural [[free radical|radicals]], he contributed to the establishment of [[structural theory]]. One of the more dramatic successes of his theory was his prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s, a conjecture that was soon confirmed by the synthesis of these substances.

He worked on the [[electrolysis]] of the salts of [[fatty acid|fatty]] and other [[acid]]s ([[Kolbe electrolysis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Ueber Synthese der Salicylsäure
 | author = Hermann Kolbe
 | journal = [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]
 | year = 1860

 | doi =  10.1002/jlac.18601130120}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certain method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the [[Kolbe nitrile synthesis]].

Hermann Kolbe was the first person to use the word [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] in the present day meaning. 

With [[Edward Frankland]] he found that [[nitrile]]s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.

==Conflicts==
As editor of the ''Journal für praktische Chemie'' (''Journal of practical chemistry'', from 1870 to 1884), Kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others, especially after about 1874, that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness.  He was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory, and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory.

His rejection of structural chemistry, especially the theories of the structure of benzene by [[August Kekulé]], the theory of the [[asymmetric carbon atom]] by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|J.H. van't Hoff]], and the reform of chemical nomenclature by [[Adolf von Baeyer]], resulted in vituperative articles in the ''Journal für Praktische Chemie''.  Some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists: 
&quot;...Baeyer is an excellent experimentor, but he is only an empiricist, lacking sense and capability, and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science...&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title = Begründung meiner Urtheile über Ad. Baeyer's wissenschaftliche Qualification 
| author = Hermann Kolbe
| journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie

| year = 1882 
| pages = 308–323
| doi = 10.1002/prac.18820260121}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation.  He died of a heart attack, in [[Leipzig]].

'''Amitabh Bachchan''' ({{lang-hi|अमिताभ बच्चन}}, {{IPA-hns|əmɪtaːbʱ bəttʃən|pron}}, born '''Amitabh Harivansh Bachchan''' on 11 October 1942), is an Indian film actor and producer. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s as the &quot;angry young man&quot; of [[Hindi cinema]], and has since become one of the most prominent figures in the history of [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/access-all-areas/videos/screen-icons-amitabh-bachchan,200,BA.html |title=Amitabh Bachchan: the Angry Young Man |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=angryyoungman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1945451.stm |title=Film legend promotes Bollywood |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-04-23 |accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachchan has won numerous [[List of Amitabh Bachchan's awards, honours and recognitions|major awards]] in his career, including four [[National Film Awards]], three of which are in the [[National Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] category, and fourteen [[Filmfare Awards]]. He is the most-nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 36 nominations overall. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a [[playback singer]], [[film producer]] and [[television presenter]], and was an elected member of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] from 1984 to 1987.

==Early life==
{{seealso|Bachchan family}}
Born in [[Allahabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], Amitabh Bachchan hails from a [[Hindu]] [[Kayastha]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archana Srivastava, TNN, Oct 20, 2001, 11.02pm IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SP-looks-up-to-Big-B-with-an-eye-on-Kayastha-votes/articleshow/1181068878.cms |title=SP looks up to Big B with an eye on Kayastha votes - The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2001-10-20 |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayasthaparivar.org/prominent_personalitieshtm.htm |title=Welcome to Kayastha Parivar |publisher=Kayasthaparivar.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Dr. [[Harivansh Rai Bachchan]] was a well-known [[Hindi]] poet, while his mother, [[Teji Bachchan]] was a [[Sikh]]-[[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] from [[Faisalabad]] (now in [[Pakistan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;sikh&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bollywood cinema: temples of desire|author=Mishra, Vijay|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0-415-93015-4|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan was initially named Inquilaab, inspired from the famous phrase [[Inquilab Zindabad]], during the Indian independence struggle. However, at the suggestion of fellow poet [[Sumitranandan Pant]], Harivansh Rai changed the name to Amitabh which means, &quot;the light that would never go off.&quot; Though his surname was [[Shrivastava]], his father had adopted the pen-name Bachchan (meaning child-like in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all his works. It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films, and, for all public purposes, it has become the surname of all members of his family. Bachchan's father passed away in 2003, and his mother in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teji Bachchan passes away|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=2078579f-853d-48ae-b826-eeee479169e2&amp;ParentID=d5c75cbf-62a5-49eb-a016-0cf71383854b&amp;&amp;Headline=Big+B's+mother+Teji+Bachchan+is+no+more|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|author=Khan, Alifiya|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amitabh is the eldest of Harivansh Rai Bachchan's two sons, the second being Ajitabh. His mother had a keen interest in theatre and had been offered a role in a film, but preferred her domestic duties. She had some degree of influence in Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should take the centre stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB and his parents&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Reviews on: To Be or Not To Be Amitabh Bachchan - Khalid Mohamed |url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/To_Be_or_Not_To_Be_Amitabh_Bachchan_-_Khalid_Mohamed-72513-1.haster_of_Arts}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Allahabad]]'s [[Jnana Prabodhini]] and [[Boys' High School &amp; College, Allahabad|Boys' High School]] (BHS), followed by [[Nainital]]'s [[Sherwood College]], where he majored in the art stream. He later went on to study at [[Kirori Mal College]] of the [[University of Delhi]] and completed a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. In his twenties, Bachchan gave up a job as freight broker for the shipping firm, Bird and Co., based in [[Calcutta]] now known as Kolkata, to pursue a career in acting.

==Career==
===Early work: 1969–1972===
Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|National Award]] winning film ''[[Bhuvan Shome]]''. Thereafter he got his first acting role as one of the seven protagonists in '' [[Saat Hindustani]]'', a film directed by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] and featuring [[Utpal Dutt]], [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] and [[Jalal Agha]]. Though the film was not a financial success, Bachchan won his first [[National Film Award]] for ''Best Newcomer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;First national award&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=India Times |title=Bachchan wins his first national award |url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1905623.cms |accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Anand (1970 film)|Anand]]'' (1971) followed, where he starred alongside [[Rajesh Khanna]]. Bachchan's role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garned him his first [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. Amitabh then played his first negative role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in ''[[Parwaana]]'' (1971). This was followed by several films including ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film ''[[Guddi]]'' which starred his future wife [[Jaya Bhaduri]]. He narrated part of the film ''[[Bawarchi]]''. In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy ''[[Bombay to Goa]]'', directed by [[S. Ramanathan]].

===Rise to stardom: 1973–1983===
[[Image:Sholay-Main Male Cast.jpg|thumb|The main male leads of Sholay. Left to right: Amitabh Bachchan, [[Dharmendra]], [[Sanjeev Kumar]] and [[Amjad Khan]].]]
Director [[Prakash Mehra]] cast him in the leading role for the film ''[[Zanjeer]]'' (1973) as Inspector Vijay Khanna. The film was a sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it and established Amitabh in a new persona—the &quot;angry young man&quot; of [[Bollywood]] cinema,.&lt;ref name=angryyoungman/&gt; He earned a Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor. 1973 was also the year he married Jaya and around this time they appeared in several films together, not only in ''Zanjeer'' but in films such as ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' which followed and was released only a month after their marriage. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram in the film ''[[Namak Haraam]]'', a social drama directed by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]].

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as ''[[Kunwara Baap]]'' and ''[[Dost]]'', before playing a supporting role in  ''[[Roti Kapda Aur Makaan]]''. The film, directed and written by [[Manoj Kumar]], addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship. Bachchan then played the leading role in film ''[[Majboor]]'', released on 6 December 1974, which was a remake of the [[Hollywood]] film [[Zigzag (1970 film)|Zigzag]]. The film was only a moderate success at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=180&amp;catName=MTk3NA== Box Office India].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'', the crime drama ''[[Faraar]]'' to the romantic drama ''[[Mili (film)|Mili]]''. 1975 was the year when he appeared in two films which are regarded as important in Hindi cinematic history. He starred in the [[Yash Chopra]] directed film ''[[Deewar (1975 film)|Deewar]]'', opposite [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Nirupa Roy]], and [[Neetu Singh]], which earned him a Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=181&amp;catName=MTk3NQ== |title=Box Office 1975|work=BoxOffice India.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indiatimes Movies'' ranks ''Deewaar'' amongst the ''Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustsee&quot;/&gt; Released on 15 August 1975 was ''[[Sholay]]'' (meaning flames), which became the highest grossing film of all time in India, earning [[Indian rupee|INR]] 2,36,45,00,000 equivalent to US$ 60 million, after adjusting for [[inflation]].&lt;ref name=boxoffice&gt;{{cite web|title=Sholay |url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |publisher=International Business Overview Standard |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. In 1999, [[BBC]] India declared it the &quot;Film of the Millennium&quot; and like ''Deewar'', has been cited by ''[[Indiatimes]] movies'' as amongst the ''Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustsee&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Kanwar, Rachna |title=25 Must See Bollywood Movies |date=3 October 2005 |url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/Special_Features/25_Must_See_Bollywood_Movies/articleshow/msid-1250837,curpg-10.cms |publisher=Indiatimes movies |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual [[Filmfare awards]] awarded it with the special distinction award called [[Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years]].

Bachchan starred in comedies such as  ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975) and ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977) and in films such as ''[[Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976). In 1976, he was once again cast by director [[Yash Chopra]] in his second film, ''Kabhi Kabhie'', a romantic tale in which Bachchan starred as a young poet named Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja played by actress [[Rakhee Gulzar]].  The film saw him again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 1977, he won his first [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]] for his performance in ''Amar Akbar Anthony'' where he played the third lead opposite [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Anthony Gonsalves. In 1978  he starred in all four of the highest grossing films of India in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ibosnetwork.com |title= Bachchan's historic 1978 year at the box office |url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/topgrossersbyyear.asp?year=1978 |accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He once again resumed double roles in films such as ''[[Kasme Vaade]]'' as Amit and Shankar and ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look alike Vijay. His performance won him his second [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]]. He also performed in ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' and ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikander]]'' which both earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. He was billed a &quot;one-man industry&quot; by the French director [[François Truffaut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=China Daily |title= Truffaut labeled Bachchan a one-man industry |url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/history/00-07-07/l03-film.html |accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, for the first time, Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the film ''[[Mr. Natwarlal]]'' in which he starred alongside [[Rekha]]. His performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the [[Filmfare Best Male Playback Award]]s. In 1979, he also received Best Actor nomination for ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'' (1979) and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the [[Raj Khosla]] directed film ''[[Dostana (1980 film)|Dostana]]'', in which he starred opposite [[Shatrughan Sinha]] and [[Zeenat Aman]]. ''Dostana'' proved to be the top grossing film of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&amp;catName=MTk4MA== |title=BoxOffice India.com |publisher=BoxOffice India.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film ''[[Silsila]]'', where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and rumoured lover [[Rekha]]. Other films of this period include ''[[Ram Balram]]'' (1980), ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980), ''[[Lawaaris]]'' (1981), and ''[[Shakti (1982 film)|Shakti]]'' (1982) which pitted him against legendary actor [[Dilip Kumar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Box office success&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=boxofficeindia.com |title= Bachchan's box office success |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors&amp;PHPSESSID=cfa06e3b5a051913d58987e99cd292ae |accessdate=10 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 injury while filming ''Coolie''===
On 26 July 1982, while filming ''[[Coolie (1983 film)|Coolie]]'' in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor [[Puneet Issar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolie fight scene&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=rediff.com |title=Bachchan injured whilst shooting scene |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm |accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a [[splenic rupture]] from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency [[splenectomy]] and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Footage of Coolie fight scene&quot;&gt;{{cite web| work=IMDB |title=Footage of fight scene in Coolie released to the public |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085361/trivia| accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, he spent many months recovering and resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=boxofficeindia.com |title=Coolie a success |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=125&amp;catName=MTk4MC0xOTg5 |accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director, [[Manmohan Desai]], altered the ending of ''Coolie'' after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Footage of Coolie fight scene&quot; /&gt;

Later, he was diagnosed with [[Myasthenia gravis]]. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received. Before every release he would negatively state, &quot;Yeh film to flop hogi!&quot; (&quot;This film will flop&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Myasthenia Gravis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=mouthshut.com|title=Reviews on: To Be or Not To Be Amitabh Bachchan |author=Mohamed, Khalid|url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/To_Be_or_Not_To_Be_Amitabh_Bachchan_-_Khalid_Mohamed-72513-1.html |accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics: 1984–1987===
In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, [[Rajiv Gandhi]].  He contested Allahabad's seat of [[8th Lok Sabha]] against [[H. N. Bahuguna]], former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh]] and won by the one of the highest victory margins in [[General elections in India|general election history]] (68.2% of the vote).&lt;ref name=election&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm |title=Amitabh Bachchan: Stint in Politics |publisher=HindustanTimes.com |accessdate=2005-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a [[cesspool]]. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the &quot;[[Bofors scandal]]&quot; by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court. Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan |title=Interview with Amitabh Bachchan |publisher=sathnam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His old friend, [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]], helped him during a financial crisis due to the failure of his company ABCL. Therefore Bachchan started to support Amar Singh's political party, the Samajwadi party. Jaya Bachchan joined the [[Samajwadi Party]] and became a [[Rajya Sabha]] member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/18/stories/2007021804271000.htm &quot;Bachchan has no plans for election.&quot;] hindu.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan has continued to do favors for the Samajwadi party, including advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently gotten him into trouble again in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5bPT62ngo |title=Bollywood's Bachchan in trouble over crime claim |publisher=AFP |date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15 year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by ''[[Stardust (magazine)|Stardust]]'' and some of the other film magazines. In his own defense, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/01/27/2173/index.html &quot;The 15-year ban on Bachchan!&quot;] IndiaFM News Bureau. 27 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slump and retirement: 1988–1992===
In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in ''[[Shahenshah (film)|Shahenshah]]'', which was a box office success due to the hype of Bachchan's comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors&amp;PHPSESSID=cfa06e3b5a051913d58987e99cd292ae |work=www.boxofficeindia.com/topactors.htm |title=Top Actor}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'', for which he won his third [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]], looked like it might reverse this trend, but the momentum was short-lived as his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this period that Bachchan won his first [[National Film Award for Best Actor]], for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film ''[[Agneepath]]''. These years would be the last he would be seen on screen for some time. After the release of ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'' in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. In 1994, one of his delayed films ''[[Insaniyat (1994 film)|Insaniyat]]'' was released but was also a box office failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=200&amp;catName=MTk5NA== |work=Box Office India |title=Box Office 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producer and acting comeback 1996–1999===
Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation]], Ltd. (A.B.C.L.) in 1996, with the vision of becoming a 10 billion rupees (approx 250 million $US) premier entertainment company by the year 2000. ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering the entire section of the India's entertainment industry. Its operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, celebrity and event management. Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film was produced by the company. ''[[Tere Mere Sapne (1996 film)|Tere Mere Sapne]]'' failed to do well at the box office but launched the careers of actors such as [[Arshad Warsi]] and South films star [[Simran (actress)|Simran]]. ABCL produced a few other films, none of which did well.

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film ''[[Mrityudaata]]'', produced by ABCL. Though ''Mrityudaata'' attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically. ABCL was the main sponsor of the ''[[Miss World 1996|1996 Miss World beauty pageant]]'', [[Bangalore]] but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by Indian Industries board. The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay [[bungalow]] 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of [[Canara Bank]] were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to Sahara India Finance for raising funds for his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=Muqaddar Ka Sikandar |author=Patil, Vimla |date=4 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with ''[[Bade Miyan Chote Miyan]]'' (1998),&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice1994&quot;/&gt; and received positive reviews for ''[[Sooryavansham]]'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/1999/may/22soo.htm |author=Taliculam, Sharmila |title=He's back!}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other films such as ''[[Lal Baadshah]]'' (1999) and ''[[Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999 film)|Hindustan Ki Kasam]]'' (1999) were box office failures.

===Television career===
In the year 2000, Bachchan stepped up to host India's adaptation of the British television game show, ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' entitled, ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]''. As it did in most other countries where it was adopted, the program found immediate success. [[Canara Bank]] withdrew its law suit against Bachchan in November 2000. Bachchan hosted KBC till November 2005, and its success set the stage for his return to film popularity. In 2009 Oscar winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' in the first question of ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]]'' contest &quot;Amitabh Bachchan&quot; was the correct answer to the question &quot;Who was the star of ''[[Zanjeer]]''? [[Feroz Abbas Khan]] performed as Amitabh Bachchan in a scene in the movie while [[Anil Kapoor]] performed as the host of the contest. Bachchan hosted the [[Bigg Boss (Season 3)|third season]] of the reality show ''[[Bigg Boss]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amitabh Bachchan will host 3rd edition of 'Big Boss 3'|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/amitabh-bachchan-will-host-3rd-edition-of-b/512958/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=2010-12-28|date=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to prominence: 2000–present===
In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in [[Yash Chopra]]'s box-office hit, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'', directed by [[Aditya Chopra]]. He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of [[Shahrukh Khan]]. His role won him his third [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in ''[[Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love]]'' (2001), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham]]'' (2001) and ''[[Baghban (film)|Baghban]]'' (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in ''[[Aks (film)|Aks]]'' (2001), ''[[Aankhen (2002 film)|Aankhen]]'' (2002), ''[[Khakee]]'' (2004) and ''[[Dev (film)|Dev]]'' (2004). One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s ''[[Black (film)|Black]]'' (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] and fourth [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]]. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' tribute ''[[Sarkar (film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna]]'' (2006). All of them were successful at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starring with son&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Box Office India |title=Amitabh and Abhishek rule the box office |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=211&amp;catName=MjAwNQ== | accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212&amp;catName=MjAwNg== |title=Box Office 2006|work=Box Office India | accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were ''[[Baabul (2006 film)|Baabul]]'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212&amp;catName=MjAwNg== |title=Films fail at the BO |work=Box Office India}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eklavya]]'' and ''[[Nishabd]]'' (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bachchan's films fail at the box office&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bollywood Hungma |author=Adarsh, Taran |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/trade/top5/326.html |title=Top 5: 'Nishabd', 'N.P.D.' are disasters |accessdate=26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, two of his films ''[[Cheeni Kum]]'' and the multi-starrer ''[[Shootout at Lokhandwala]]'' were released. ''Shootout at Lokhandwala'' did very well at the box office and was declared a hit in India, while ''Cheeni Kum'' picked up after a slow start and was declared an overall average hit.&lt;ref name = &quot;udxlrh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com|title=Box Office India}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remake of his biggest hit, ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), entitled ''[[Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag]]'', released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception.&lt;ref name = &quot;udxlrh&quot;/&gt; The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, [[Rituparno Ghosh]]'s ''[[The Last Lear]]''. The film premiered at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since ''Black''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/09/11/3020|title=This is Amitabh's best performance after Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, ''[[Shantaram (film)|Shantaram]]'', directed by [[Mira Nair]] and starring [[Hollywood]] actor [[Johnny Depp]] in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer's strike, was pushed to September 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=ourbollywood.com |title=Amitabh Bachchan to star with Johnny Depp |url=http://www.ourbollywood.com/2007/02/amitabh_bachchan_will_star_opp.html | accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is currently &quot;shelved&quot; indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-diary-shantaram-film--lumiere-festival-tom-atkinson-hans-holbein-harold-evans-1819450.html | title=Underworld tale won't see light of day | date=November&amp;nbsp;13, 2009 | accessdate=May&amp;nbsp;23, 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Arifa | last=Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivek Sharma]]'s ''[[Bhoothnath]]'', in which he plays the title role as a [[ghost]], was released on 9 May 2008. ''[[Sarkar Raj]]'', the sequel of the 2005 film ''[[Sarkar (film)|Sarkar]]'', released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box-office. His latest movie was ''[[Paa (film)|Paa]]'', which released at the end of 2009. ''Paa'' was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance. It won him his third [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] and fifth [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]]. In 2010, he debuted in [[Malayalam film]] through ''[[Kandahar (2010 film)|Kandahar]]'', directed by [[Major Ravi]] and co-starring [[Mohanlal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.rediff.com/interview/2010/jun/08/south-major-ravi-on-kandahar.htm |title=Major Ravi gets ready to shoot Kandahar: Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Movies.rediff.com |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was based on the hijacking incident of the [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/56171.html |title=Big B in 'Kandahaar' along with Sunil Shetty |publisher=indiaglitz.com |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan did not receive any remuneration for this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/amitabh-to-forego-fee-for-sharing-screen-with-mohanlal/607690/0|title=Amitabh to forego fee for sharing screen with Mohanlal|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|date=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
===2005 hospitalisation===
In November 2005, Amitabh Bachchan was admitted to [[Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre|Lilavati Hospital]]'s [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]] once more, to undergo surgery for [[diverticulitis]] of the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/dec/01ab1.htm |title=Amitabh better today |publisher=Rediff |accessdate=2008-04-27 |date=1 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after Bachchan complained of pains in his abdomen some days prior. During the period and that following his recovery, most of his projects were put on hold, including the television show he was in the process of hosting, ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]''. Amitabh returned to work in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2005/12/09/stories/2005120903020100.htm |title=Waiting for Mr. Bachchan |publisher=The Hindu |accessdate=2008-04-27 |date=9 December 2005 |author=Us Salam, Ziya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice==
Bachchan is known for his deep, baritone voice. He has been a narrator, a [[playback singer]] and presenter for numerous programmes. Renowned film director [[Satyajit Ray]] was so impressed with Bachchan's voice, that he decided to use his voice as commentary in ''[[Shatranj Ke Khiladi]]'' since he could not find a suitable role for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.in/news/specials/amitabh/trivia.htm hindustantimes.in  &quot;Amitabh voice for Shatranj Ke Khiladi.&quot;] ''Hindustan Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Bachchan has lent his voice to the Oscar-winning French documentary [[March of the Penguins]], directed by [[Luc Jacquet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20061012-1.html |title=Amitabh to get France's highest civilian honour : Bollywood News |publisher=ApunKaChoice.Com |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==
===Barabanki land case===
In the runup to the [[Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections, 2007]], Bachchan made a film extolling the virtues of the [[Mulayam Singh]] government. His [[Samajwadi Party]] was routed, and [[Mayawati]] came to power.

On 2 June 2007 a [[Faizabad]] court ruled that he had legally acquired agricultural land designated specifically for landless [[Dalit]] farmers.&lt;ref name=ndtv&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2007, after the scandal broke out, Bachchan surrendered the land acquired in [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Pune]]. He wrote to the chief minister of [[Maharashtra]], Vilasrao Deshmukh, to donate the lands that were allegedly acquired illegally in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jun/01farm.htm |title=Amitabh Bachchan is not a farmer: UP court |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=2008-04-27 |date=1 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lucknow Court has put a stay on the land donation and said that the status quo on the land be maintained.

On 12 October 2007, Bachchan abandoned his claim in respect of the land at Daulatpur village in [[Barabanki district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Big_B_abandons_claim_on_farmland/articleshow/2453216.cms |work=Times of India |title=Big B abandons claim on farmland |12 October 2007 |date=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 2007, the [[Lucknow]] bench of the [[Allahabad High Court]] gave a clean chit to Bachchan in a case pertaining to alleged fraudulent allotment of government land to him in Barabanki district.

After receiving a positive verdict in Barabanki case, Amitabh Bachchan intimated to Maharashtra government that he did not wish to surrender his land in Maval tehsil of Pune district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200803251965.htm |title=No question of proceeding further on Amitabh's land: Rane |work=hindu.com | location=Chennai, India |date=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raj Thackeray's criticism===
{{Main|2008 attacks on North Indians in Maharashtra}}
[[Image:Amitabhmall.jpg|thumb|right|Bachchan featured on an advert in shopping mall in India]]
In January 2008 at political rallies, [[Raj Thackeray]], the chief of [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]], targeted Amitabh Bachchan, asserting that the actor was &quot;more inclined&quot; towards his native state than Maharashtra. He expressed his disapproval of Amitabh's inaugurating a girls' school named after his daughter-in-law, actress [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]], at [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]] in Uttar Pradesh, rather than in Maharashtra.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI_verbal&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Big_B_draws_Raj_Thackerays_ire_over_his_UP_interests/articleshow/2750611.cms |title=Big B draws Raj Thakeray's ire over 'UP interests' |publisher=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=2008-05-30 |date=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to media reports, Raj's censure of Amitabh, whom he admires, stemmed out of his disappointment of not being invited to Amitabh's son [[Abhishek Bachchan|Abhishek]]'s marriage to Aishwarya, despite invitations to his estranged uncle Bal and cousin Uddhav.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1149212 |accessdate=2008-04-04 |title=Rift between Raj and Big B over a wedding invite |publisher=[[Daily News &amp; Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.in.msn.com/national/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1226808 |accessdate=2008-04-04 |title=Rift between Raj and Big B over a wedding invite |date=2008-02-05| publisher=[[MSN]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080312103245/http://news.in.msn.com/national/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1226808 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to Raj's accusations, the actor's wife, SP MP Jaya Bachchan, said that the Bachchans were willing to start a school in Mumbai, provided the MNS leader donated the land to build it. She told the media, &quot;I heard that Raj Thackeray owns huge properties in Maharashtra, in Mumbai—Kohinoor Mills. If he is willing to donate land, we can start a school in the name of Aishwarya here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IE_Jaya&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/I-dont-know-who-Raj-Thackeray-is-Jaya-Bachchan/268548/ |title=I don't know who Raj Thackeray is: Jaya Bachchan |publisher=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raj responded to it saying, &quot;Jaya bachchan claims she does not know me then how come she knows how much property I own?&quot;. Amitabh abstained from commenting on the issue. However, he apologized to Raj for controversial remarks from Jaya in some other incidence. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/raj-accepts-amitabh-apology-turns-guns-on/360441/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bal Thackeray]] refuted the allegations, stating, &quot;Amitabh Bachchan is an open-minded person, he has great love for Maharashtra, and this is evident on many occasions. The actor has often said that Maharashtra and specially Mumbai has given him great fame and affection. He has also said that what he is today is because of the love people have given him. The people of Mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste. It was utter foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him. Amitabh is a global superstar. People all over the world respect him. This cannot be forgotten by anyone. Amitabh should ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/07/stories/2008020759011200.htm |accessdate=2008-04-04 |title=Bal Thackeray: Amitabh loves Maharashtra |date=2008-02-07 |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2008, more than a month and half after Raj's remarks, Amitabh finally spoke out in an interview to a local tabloid saying, &quot;Random charges are random; they do not deserve the kind of attention you wish me to give.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA_1157267&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1157267 |accessdate=2008-04-04 |publisher=[[Daily News &amp; Analysis]] |title=Amitabh breaks silence, dismisses Raj's charges against him}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on 28 March at a press conference for the [[International Indian Film Academy]], when asked what his take was on the anti-migrant issue, Amitabh said that it is one's fundamental right to live anywhere in the country and the constitution entitles so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/indian-constitution-allows-me-to-live-anywhere-in-the-country-amitabh-bachchan_10032279.html |publisher=[[The Indian]] |title=The Indian Constitution allows me to live anywhere: Amitabh Bachchan |accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he was not affected by Raj's comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200803281441.htm|accessdate=2008-04-04|date=2008-03-28 |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |title=Everyone has the right to freedom of expression: Bachchan|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from [[National Film Awards]], [[Filmfare Awards]] and other competitive awards which Bachchan won for his performances throughout the years, he has been awarded several honours for his achievements in the Indian film industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Keep this note! Technical term, necessary for wikipedia articles; don't assign for wiktionary --&gt;
:''This article is about a linguistic term. See [[Pseudomorph]] for another meaning of the word.''

An '''allomorph''' is a [[linguistics]] term for a variant form of a [[morpheme]]. The concept occurs when a unit of meaning can vary in sound (phonologically) without changing meaning. It is used in linguistics to explain the comprehension of variations in sound for a specific morpheme.

==Allomorphy in English suffixes==
English has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning. Examples include the past tense and the plural morphemes.

For example, in [[English language|English]], a past tense morpheme is ''-ed''.  It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a [[schwa]] when following an alveolar stop:

*as {{IPA|/əd/}} or {{IPA|/ɪd/}} in verbs whose [[Word stem|stem]] ends with the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}, such as 'hunted' {{IPA|/hʌntəd/}} or 'banded' {{IPA|/bændəd/}}
*as {{IPA|/t/}} in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than {{IPA|/t/}}, such as 'fished' {{IPA|/fɪʃt/}}
*as {{IPA|/d/}} in verbs whose stem ends voiced phonemes other than {{IPA|/d/}}, such as 'buzzed' {{IPA|/bʌzd/}}

Notice the &quot;other than&quot; restrictions above. This is a common fact about allomorphy: if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive (in this case, after an alveolar stop) to least restrictive, then the first matching case usually &quot;wins&quot;.  Thus, the above conditions could be re-written as follows:

*as {{IPA|/əd/}} or {{IPA|/ɪd/}}  when the stem ends with the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}
*as {{IPA|/t/}} when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes
*as {{IPA|/d/}} elsewhere

The fact that the {{IPA|/t/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final {{IPA|/t/}}, despite the fact that the latter is voiceless, is then explained by the fact that {{IPA|/əd/}} appears in that environment, together with the fact that the environments are ordered. Likewise, the fact that the {{IPA|/d/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final {{IPA|/d/}} is because the earlier clause for the {{IPA|/əd/}} allomorph takes priority; and the fact that the {{IPA|/d/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phonemes is because the preceding clause for the {{IPA|/t/}} takes priority.

Irregular past tense forms, such as &quot;broke&quot; or &quot;was/ were&quot;, can be seen as still more specific cases (since they are confined to certain lexical items, like the verb &quot;break&quot;), which therefore take priority over the general cases listed above.

==Stem allomorphy==
Allomorphy can also exist in stems or [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], as in Classical [[Sanskrit]]:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+'''Vāk''' (voice)
|-
!  
!'''Singular'''
!'''Plural'''
|-
! [[Nominative]]
|{{IPA|/vaːk/}}
|{{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ-as/}}
|- 
! [[Genitive case|Genitive]]
|{{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ-as/}}
|{{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ-aːm/}}
|-
! [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]
|{{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ-aː/}}
|{{IPA|/vaːɡ-bʱis/}}
|-
! [[Locative case|Locative]]
|{{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ-i/}}
|{{IPA|/vaːk-ʂi/}}

There are three allomorphs of the stem: {{IPA|/vaːk/}}, {{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/vaːɡ/}}.  The allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes.

The form of the stem {{IPA|/vaːk/}}, found in the nominative singular and locative plural, is the etymological form of the morpheme. Pre-Indic palatalization of [[velars]] resulted in the variant form {{IPA|/vaːt͡ʃ/}}, which was initially phonologically conditioned. This conditioning can still be seen in the Locative Singular form, where the {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} is followed by the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.

But subsequent merging of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} into {{IPA|/a/}} made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the Genitive case (both Singular and Plural), as well as the Nominative Plural and Instrumental Singular. Hence, this allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes.

Phonological conditioning also accounts for the {{IPA|/vaːɡ/}} form found in the Instrumental Plural, where the {{IPA|/ɡ/}} assimilates in voicing to the following {{IPA|/bʱ/}}.

==History==
The term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure. It was first applied to language (in writing) in 1948, by E.A. Nida in Language XXIV. &lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary Online: Entry 50006103. Accessed: 2006-09-05 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phoneme-allophone-determination-chart.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of basic procedure to determine whether two sounds are allophones]]
In [[phonetics]], an '''allophone''' [æləfoʊn] (from the {{lang-el|ἄλλος}}, ''állos'', &quot;other&quot; and φωνή, ''phōnē'', &quot;voice, sound&quot;) is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds (or ''[[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]'') used to pronounce a single [[phoneme]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref00qacid&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Structure of Language and Its Mathematical Aspects: Proceedings of symposia in applied mathematics | author=R. Jakobson | publisher=AMS Bookstore, 1980 | isbn=9780821813126 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ou_zOzU9wEwC | quote=''... An allophone is the set of phones contained in the intersection of a maximal set of phonetically similar phones and a primary phonetically related set of phones ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{IPA|[pʰ]}} (as in ''pin'') and {{IPA|[p]}} (as in ''spin'') are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the [[English language]]. Although a phoneme's allophones are all alternative pronunciations for a phoneme, the specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable. Changing the allophone used by native speakers for a given phoneme in a specific context usually will not change the meaning of a word but the result may sound non-native or unintelligible. Speakers of a given language usually perceive one phoneme in their language as a single distinctive sound in that language and are &quot;''both unaware of and even shocked by''&quot; the allophone variations used to pronounce single phonemes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref89rahec&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Linguistics and Phonetics | author=B.D.

==Complementary and free-variant allophones==
Every time a speech sound is produced for a given phoneme, it will be slightly different from other utterances, even for the same speaker. This has led to some debate over how real, and how universal, phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant (i.e., detectable or perceivable) to speakers. There are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation, or whether the speaker has freedom to (unconsciously) choose which allophone he or she will use.

When a specific allophone (from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme) ''must'' be selected in a given context (i.e. using a different allophone for a phoneme will cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native), the allophones are said to be '''complementary''' (i.e. the allophones complement each other, and one is not used in a situation where the usage of another is standard). In the case of complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref47qoref&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M. Birch | publisher=Psychology Press, 2002 | isbn=9780805838992 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kiHSOxn0zX4C | quote=''... When the occurrence of one allophone is predictable when compared to the other, as in this case, we call this complementary distribution. Complementary distribution means that the allophones are &quot;distributed&quot; as complements ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the speaker is able to select freely from '''[[free variation|free variant]]''' allophones, based on personal habit  or preference.

==Allotone==
A [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone is sometimes called an '''allotone''', for example in the neutral tone of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].

== Examples in English vs. other languages ==
For example, {{IPA|[pʰ]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the [[English language]] because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Plain {{IPA|[p]}} also occurs as the '''p''' in ''cap'' {{IPA|[kʰæp]}}, or the second '''p''' in ''paper'' {{IPA|[pʰeɪ.pɚ]}}. [[Spoken Chinese|Chinese]] languages treat these two phones differently; for example in Mandarin, {{IPA|[p]}} (written '''b''' in [[Pinyin]]) and {{IPA|[pʰ]}} (written '''p''') contrast phonemically. Many [[Indo-Aryan languages]], such as [[Hindi-Urdu]], also write the two phones differently and treat them as completely distinct phonemes: {{IPA|[p]}} is written as 'प' (or 'پ'), while {{IPA|[pʰ]}} is written 'फ' (or 'پھ').&lt;ref name=&quot;ref13vixeb&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=English Language and Literary Criticism | author=A.S. Kharbe | publisher=Discovery Publishing House, 2009 | isbn=9788183564830 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QH91072JCpoC | quote=''... the difference between [ph] and [p] in English is nonphonemic; the two sounds realize, or belong to, the same phoneme, namely /p/. In several other languages - e.g. Hindi - the contrast between such sounds as [ph] and [p] is phonemic however ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many other allophonic processes in English, like lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.

* Aspiration – strong explosion of breath. In English a voiceless plosive that is p, t or k is aspirated whenever it stands as the only consonant at the beginning of the stressed syllable or of the first, stressed or unstressed, syllable in a word.
* Nasal plosion – In English a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, ɡ/}}) has nasal plosion when it is followed by nasal, inside a word or across word boundary.
* Partial devoicing of [[sonorants]] – In English sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, ŋ/}}) are partially devoiced when they follow a voiceless sound within the same syllable.
* Complete devoicing of sonorants – In English a sonorant is completely devoiced when it follows an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).
* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s – In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound, inside a word or across its boundary.
* Retraction – in English {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are retracted before {{IPA|/r/}}.

Because the choice of allophone is seldom under conscious control, people may not realize they exist. English speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} — namely unreleased {{IPA|[ t̚]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[tʰ]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[ʔ]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[ɾ]}} as in American English ''water'', nasalized flapped as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:

*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[ˈnʌɪt̚.ɹʷeɪt̚]}} (without [[word space]] between {{IPA|.}} and {{IPA|ɹ}})
*''Nitrate'':  aspirated {{IPA|[ˈnaɪ.tʰɹ̥eɪt̚]}}

If a flame is held before the lips while these words are spoken, it flickers more during aspirated ''nitrate'' than during unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a Mandarin speaker, to whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than it is to the English speaker who has learned since childhood to ignore it.

Allophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[ˈliːf]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[ɫ]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[ˈfiːɫ]}}. Again, this difference is much more obvious to a Turkish speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɫ/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.

===Allophony of &quot;v-w&quot; in Hindi-Urdu===
A reverse example is that of {{IPA|[v]}} versus {{IPA|[w]}} in Hindi-Urdu. These are distinct phonemes in English, but both allophones of the phoneme /व/ (or /و/) in Hindi-Urdu. Native Hindi speakers pronounce /व/ as {{IPA|[v]}} in ''vrat'' ('व्रत', ''fast'') but {{IPA|[w]}} in ''pakwan'' ('पकवान', ''food dish''), treating them as a single phoneme and without being aware of the allophone distinctions they are subconsciously making, though these are apparent to native English speakers. However, the allophone phenomenon becomes obvious when speakers switch languages. When non-native speakers speak Hindi-Urdu, they might pronounce /व/ in 'व्रत' as {{IPA|[w]}}, i.e. as ''wrat'' instead of the correct ''vrat''. This results in an intelligibility problem because ''wrat'' can easily be confused for ''aurat'', which means ''woman'' instead of ''fast'' in Hindi-Urdu. Similarly, Hindi-Urdu speakers might unconsciously apply their native 'v-w' allophony rules to English words, pronouncing ''war'' as ''var'' or ''advance'' as ''adwance'', which can result in intelligibility problems with native English speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref25lojir&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Implications of Hindi Prosodic Structure (Current Trends in Phonology: Models and Methods) | author=Janet Pierrehumbert, Rami Nair | publisher=European Studies Research Institute, University of Salford Press, 1996 | isbn=9781901471021 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_jqjQwAACAAJ | quote=''... showed extremely regular patterns. As is not uncommon in a study of subphonemic detail, the objective data patterned much more cleanly than intuitive judgments ... [w] occurs when /व/ is in onglide position ... [v] occurs otherwise ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==
Since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple (i.e. 'broad') transcription is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, so that the allophony is significant, things become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, then that representation is chosen for the phoneme. 

However, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than this allows. In such cases a common convention is to use the &quot;elsewhere condition&quot; to decide which allophone will stand for the phoneme. The &quot;elsewhere&quot; allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules. For example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only when preceding a nasal consonant within the same syllable; elsewhere they're oral. Therefore, by the &quot;elsewhere&quot; convention, the oral allophones are considered basic; nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.

In other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the world's languages than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory. In rare cases a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, so as not to privilege any one allophone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''affix''' is a [[morpheme]] that is attached to a word [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] to form a new word. Affixes may be [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]], like English ''-ness'' and ''pre-'', or [[inflection]]al, like English plural ''-s'' and past tense ''-ed''. They are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be [[separable affix]]es. Affixation is, thus, the linguistic process speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.

==Positional categories of affixes==
Affixes are divided into several categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. ''Prefix'' and ''suffix'' are extremely common terms. ''Infix'' and ''circumfix'' are less so, as they are not important in European languages. The other terms are uncommon.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

''Prefix'' and ''suffix'' may be subsumed under the term ''adfix'' in contrast to ''infix.''

In transcription, for example in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are shown connected to the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde.

==Lexical affixes==
''Lexical affixes'' (or ''semantic affixes'') are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as [[incorporated noun]]s within verbs and as elements of [[compound noun]]s. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.

Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]], and [[Chimakuan languages]] all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an [[areal feature]] of the Pacific Northwest of the [[North America]].

The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of [[Saanich language|Northern Straits Saanich]] written in the Saanich orthography and in [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist notation]]:

{| class=&quot;IPA wikitable&quot;

| &quot;house&quot;
|}

Lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such &quot;saltwater&quot;, &quot;whitewater&quot;, etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to various degrees.

Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic [[Verb argument|arguments]] just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the [[Halkomelem language]] (the [[word order]] here is [[Verb Subject Object]]):

|}

In sentence (1), the verb &quot;wash&quot; is {{unicode|'''šak’ʷətəs'''}} where {{unicode|'''šak’ʷ-'''}} is the root and {{unicode|'''-ət'''}} and {{unicode|'''-əs'''}} are inflectional suffixes. The subject &quot;the woman&quot; is {{unicode|'''łə słeniʔ'''}} and the object &lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;&quot;the baby&quot;&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;{{unicode|'''łə qeq'''}}&lt;/span&gt;. In this sentence, &quot;the baby&quot; is a free noun. (The {{unicode|'''niʔ'''}} here is an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)

In sentence (2), &lt;span style=&quot;color:#d30000&quot;&gt;&quot;baby&quot;&lt;/span&gt; does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix &lt;span style=&quot;color:#d30000&quot;&gt;{{unicode|'''-əyəł'''}}&lt;/span&gt; which is affixed to the verb root {{unicode|'''šk’ʷ-'''}} (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). Note how the lexical suffix is neither &quot;the baby&quot; ([[definiteness|definite]]) nor &quot;a baby&quot; (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.

==Orthographic affixes==
In [[orthography]], the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. For example, [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] are generally compounds of a ''main sign'' and smaller ''affixes'' joined at its margins. These are called ''prefixes, superfixes, postfixes,'' and ''subfixes'' according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. A small glyph placed inside another is called an ''infix.''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sharer &amp; Loa Traxler, 2006, ''The Ancient Maya,'' Stanford University Press. ISBN 0-8047-4817-9&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the [[Indic alphabets]]. For example, the [[Tibetan alphabet]] utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew West]], [http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/09/precomposed-tibetan-part-1-brdarten.html &quot;Precomposed Tibetan Part 1 : BrdaRten&quot;] ''BabelStone,'' September 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|''Allegory of Music'' by [[Filippino Lippi]]. The &quot;Allegory of Music&quot; is a popular theme in painting; in this example, Lippi uses [[symbol]]s popular during the [[High Renaissance]], many of which refer to Greek mythology.]]
Allegory is a [[figurative]] [[mode]] of representation conveying  meaning other than the verbal. Allegory communicates its message by means of [[symbol]]ic figures, actions or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]], but an allegory does not have to be expressed in [[language]]: briefly, an allegory is a device used to present an idea, principle or meaning, which can be presented in literary form, such as a poem or novel, or in visual form, such as in painting or drawing. As a [[literary device]], an allegory in its most general sense is an extended [[metaphor]]. As an artistic device, an allegory is a visual symbolic representation. An example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]]. Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death. Not every fiction with general application is an allegory.

==Etymology==
First attested in English 1382, the word ''allegory'' comes from [[Latin]] ''allegoria'', the [[latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλληγορία (''allegoria''), &quot;veiled language, figurative&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29llhgori%2Fa ἀλληγορία], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;  from ἄλλος (''allos''), &quot;another, different&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fllos1 ἄλλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + ἀγορεύω (''agoreuo''), &quot;to harangue, to  speak in the assembly&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29goreu%2Fw ἀγορεύω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from ἀγορά (''agora''), &quot;assembly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29gora%2F ἀγορά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northrop Frye]] discussed what he termed a &quot;continuum of allegory,&quot; ranging from what he termed the &quot;naive allegory&quot; of ''[[The Faerie Queene]],'' to the more private allegories of modern [[Paradox (literature)|paradox literature]]. In this perspective, the characters in a &quot;naive&quot; allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the allegory has been selected first, and the details merely flesh it out.

Many ancient religions are based on an [[astrologic allegory|astrologic allegories]], that is, allegories of the movement of the Sun and the Moon as seen from the Earth. Examples include the cult of [[Horus]]/[[Isis]].

==The classical era==

In classical literature two of the best-known allegories are [[Allegory of the cave|the cave]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa ([[Livy]] ii. 32). In Late Antiquity [[Martianus Capella]] organized all the information a fifth-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and ''Philologia,'' with the seven [[liberal arts]] as guests; Capella's allegory was widely read through the Middle Ages.

Other early allegories are found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], for instance in the extended metaphor in [[Psalm 80]] of the [[Grapevine|Vine]], which is Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = George A. | year = 1999 | title = Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times | edition = Second | publisher = UNC Press | page = 142 | isbn = 0-8078-4769-0 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LHHYx4idyPEC&amp;pg=PA142 | accessdate = 2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ezekiel]] 16 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Jones, Alexander | year = 1968 | title = The Jerusalem Bible | edition = Reader's | publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company | pages =1186, 1189 | isbn = 0-385-01156-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The medieval era==
{{Main|Allegory in the Middle Ages}}
Medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the bull ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of [[Christendom]] with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as actual facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: &quot;''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ&quot; [[s:Unam sanctam|(complete text)]].

In the late 15th century, the enigmatic ''[[Hypnerotomachia]]'', with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and [[masque]]s on contemporary allegorical representation, as [[Renaissance humanism|humanist dialectic]] conveyed them.

The denial of medieval allegory as found in the 11th-century works of [[Hugh of St Victor]] and [[Edward Topsell]]'s ''Historie of Foure-footed Beastes'' (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorization and mathematics by such figures as naturalist [[John Ray]] and the astronomer [[Galileo]] is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Harrison]], ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the rise of natural science'', [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-59196-1, pages 1 to 10 (&quot;Introduction&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The modern era==

Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories, sometimes distorting their author's overt meaning. For instance, many people have suggested that ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is an allegory for the [[world war|World Wars]], in spite of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s emphatic statement in the introduction to the second edition, &quot;It is neither allegorical nor topical.... I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.&quot; Many have also suggested that the movie &quot;[[The Dark Knight]]&quot; is an allegory for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]'s conduction of the [[War on Terror]] (the [[Batman|Dark Knight]] himself taking on the role of President [[George W. Bush]]).

Where some requirements of &quot;realism&quot;, in its flexible meanings, are set aside, allegory can come more strongly to the surface, as in the work of [[Bertold Brecht]] or [[Franz Kafka]] on one hand, or on the other in science fiction and fantasy, where an element of universal application and allegorical overtones are common, as with ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.

==Examples by genre==
Not every resonant work of modern fiction is an allegory. [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', for instance, is character-driven historical drama with contemporary relevance, but is not an allegory in spite of its parallels with McCarthyism, linking the hunt for communists in the 1940s and 1950s to the hunt for witches in the late 17th century. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly-sketched characters.&lt;!--by whom? It has been read after the fact as an allegory for the political problems of the time.--&gt; [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings]] is another example of a work seen by many as allegorical yet, as the author explained, is not - rather it is an example of what he referred to as applicability.

===Art===

      <comment>Intro - not all allotropes are molecular. Ex. neither diamond nor graphite are molecular.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Diamond and graphite.jpg|thumb|300px|Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in structure.]]
'''Allotropy''' or '''allotropism''' is the property of some [[chemical element]]s to exist in two or more different forms, known as '''allotropes''' of these elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element;&lt;ref&gt;Allotrope in ''IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology'', Electronic/ version, http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00243.html. Accessed March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atoms]] of the element are [[chemical bond|bonded]] together in a different manner.

Take [[carbon]] for example: 4 common [[allotropes of carbon]] are [[diamond]] (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). 

The term allotropy is used for elements only, not for [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[state of matter|phase]] (i.e. different [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]] forms); the changes of state between solid, liquid and gas in themselves are not considered allotropy.

For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases – for example, two [[allotropes of oxygen]] ([[oxygen|dioxygen]], O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Conversely, some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases – for example [[phosphorus]] has numerous solid allotropes, which all revert to the same P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; form when melted to the liquid state.

== History ==
The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779–1848) who offered no explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Jensen | first = W. B. | title = The Origin of the Term Allotrope | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | year = 2006 | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 838–39 | doi = 10.1021/ed083p838}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Polytonic|άλλοτροπἱα}} (''allotropia''; variability, changeableness).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = allotropy | title = A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles | volume = 1 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1888 | page = 238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of [[Avogadro's law|Avogadro's hypothesis]] in 1860 it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and the two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In the early 20th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.

By 1912, [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]] noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism. Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, [[IUPAC]] and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.

== Differences in properties of an element's allotropes ==
Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours.  The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e. [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]].  Therefore the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure [[Ferrite (iron)|(ferrite)]] to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906 °C, and [[tin]] undergoes a transformation known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metallic]] phase to a [[semiconductor]] phase below 13.2 °C. As an example of different chemical behaviour, ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

== List of allotropes ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

Typically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms.  Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to [[catenation|catenate]].  Allotropes are typically more noticeable in [[non-metal]]s (excluding the [[halogen]]s and the [[noble gas]]es) and [[metalloid]]s. Nevertheless, [[metal]]s tend to have many allotropes.

'''Agathocles''' (361–[[289 BC]]), ([[Greek language|Greek]] name ''Ἀγαθοκλῆς'' (''Agathokles''): derived from ''αγαθός'' (''agathos'') ''good'' and ''κλέος'' (''kleos'') ''glory''), was [[tyrant]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] (317–289 BC) and king of [[Sicily]] (304–289 BC).

==Biography==
Agathocles was born at Thermae [[Himera]]eae (modern name [[Termini Imerese]]) in Sicily. The son of a [[pottery|potter]] who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army. In [[333 BC]] he married the [[widow]] of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. He was twice [[Exile|banished]] for attempting to overthrow the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] party in Syracuse. 

In [[317 BC]] he returned with an army of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] under a solemn oath to observe the [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitution]] which was then set up. Having banished or murdered some 10,000 citizens, and thus made himself master of Syracuse, he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of Sicily.

War with [[Carthage]] followed. In 311 BC Agathocles was [[siege|besieged]] and defeated in Syracuse in [[Battle of Himera (311 BC)|the battle of Himera]]. After defeat in 310 BC he took the desperate resolve of breaking through the [[blockade]] and attacking the enemy in [[Africa]]. In Africa he concluded the treaty with [[Ophellas]], ruler of [[Cyrenaica]]. After several victories he was at last completely defeated ([[307 BC]]) and fled secretly to Sicily.  

After concluding peace with Carthage in [[306 BC]], Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in [[304 BC]], and established his rule over the [[Greece|Greek]] cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the [[Halycus River]]. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.

His last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson [[Archagathus]], at whose instigation he is said to have been [[poison]]ed (by his [[eromenos]], Menon of Ægista, who poisoned the tooth-cleaning quill);&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Library of Diodorus the Sicilian, in Fifteen Books, XXI.12&lt;/ref&gt; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular &quot;tyrant.&quot; Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.

The historian Alvin says that Agathocles was born in poverty but very early in life parlayed his remarkable genius into a career as an inventor, first for weapons of war, and later, after further education, for civilization, his grandest goal was to establish democracy as the dominant form of government for the world and this spurred his unquenchable thirst for power. Upon his death bed he realized that his sons did not share his wisdom or vision and is presumed to have died sadly, giving up his dream of bringing a voice to the people of the world. 

Agathocles married [[Theoxena (Ptolemy)|Theoxena]], stepdaughter of [[Ptolemy I of Egypt]]. His daughter [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]] married King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]].

==Legacy==
Agathocles was cited as from the lowest, most abject condition of life and as an example of “those who by their crimes come to be princes” in Chapter VIII of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]’s treatise on politics, ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513). He was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. However, he came to &quot;glory&quot; as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land. However, many later disapproved of his actions, including to an extent Machiavelli, who claimed &quot;It cannot be called prowess to kill fellow-citizens, to betray friends, to be treacherous, pitiless, irreligious. ... Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickednesses do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Prince'', page 29, Stage VII&lt;/ref&gt; 

Machiavelli goes on to reason that Agathocles' success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that &quot;are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects&quot;.

''' Alberta's economy''' is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the petroleum industry and, to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]74,825 (approx. US$74,000). In 2006 Alberta's per capita GDP was [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|higher than all US states]], and [[List of country subdivisions by GDP per capita (nominal)|one the highest figures in the world]] .  Alberta's per capita GDP in 2007 was 61% higher than the Canadian average of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]46,441 and more than twice that of all the [[Maritime provinces]].  In 2006, the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf |author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | title= The Alberta economic Juggernaught:The boom on the rose| month= September |year= 2006| accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic geography ==
[[File:Alberta, Canada.svg|thumb|left|Alberta's location within Canada]]
{{see also|Geography of Alberta|[[List of regions of Canada#Alberta|Regions of Alberta]]}}

Alberta has a small [[internal market]] and is relatively distant from major [[world market]]s, despite good [[transportation in Canada|transportation links to the rest of Canada]] and [[transportation in the United States|to the United States to the south]].  Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]] (and referred to by one author as North America's &quot;[[Empty Quarter (North America)|Empty Quarter]]&quot;).  Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List_of_North_American_ports#Canada_5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on the [[Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]].  From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers.  The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston – Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago – Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta.  Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metalurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).

[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has the been a key industry since the 1870s.  The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons.  Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north.  Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta that anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]].  Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there.  Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.

Conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast.  Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).

Because of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world.  Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see &quot;trends&quot; below).  Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]).

{{Economy of Canada}}

=== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor ===
The [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).&lt;ref name=&quot;CECorridor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]]  found the corridor is the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40 above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== Calgary - Edmonton rivalry ===
{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}
Seeing Calgary and Edmonton are part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel.  The more traditional view had been to see the two cities are economic rivals.  For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the &quot;Oil Capital of Canada&quot;.  Calgary is home to most oil company head offices.  Edmonton, and more so its surrounding region ([[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta|Fort Saskatchewan]]), is the site of most oil-and-gas related industry including [[Oil refinery|refining]] and manufacturing.

Alberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]].  In line with Innis' [[staples thesis]], the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance.  In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.

The development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development.  The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out and Europe good in to the region.  Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s.  Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the bulk export of grain, especially [[hopper cars]] and [[grain elevators]]. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.

Prior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[commodities]].  The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].

In 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton.  It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy).  Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]].  When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed.  However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered.  Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]].  In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year.  {{As of|2009}} with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy is in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions.

The spin-offs from petroleum have allowed Alberta to develop many other industries.  Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.

A comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played.  Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).

==Employment==
Alberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.  Primary industries are also of great importance, however.

=== Employment in extraction industries ===
As of 2007:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.alberta.ca/About_Us/1527.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Sector  = 146,900
* Oil and Gas Extraction industry = 69,900
* Support Activities for Mining &amp; Oil &amp; Gas Extraction (primarily oil and gas exploration and drilling) = 71,700
* Mining other than oil and gas (mainly coal and mineral mining &amp; quarrying) = 5,100

=== Largest employers ===
According to ''[[Alberta Venture]]'' magazine's list of the 50 largest employers in the province, the largest employers are:

==Sectors==
===Industry===
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm State of Alaska - Trade Report on Alberta]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid crystal display]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system] - US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; [http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/About+Us/News+Room/Media+Releases/2002+Media+Releases.htm?guid=%7BB3BD6857-5D25-4EC7-A741-C0232368F5FE%7D U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive Technology] - SMART Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

====Energy====
=====Oil and gas=====
[[Image:Alberta oil gas drilling well 023.jpg|thumb|Drilling rig in Alberta.]]
{{See also|Petroleum production in Canada|Natural gas in Canada}}

Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion. Alberta also provides 13% of all the natural gas used in the United States.

Notable gas reserves were discovered in the 1883 near Medicine Hat.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;[http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/About_Us/984.asp Alberta Energy: Energy Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The town of [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]] began using gas for lighting the town, and supplying light and fuel for the people, and a number of industries using the gas for manufacturing. In fact a large glassworks was established at Redcliff.  When [[Rudyard Kipling]] visited Medicine Hat he described it as the city &quot;with all hell for a basement&quot;.

====== Basic statistics ======
* In 2003, Alberta produced {{convert|629|koilbbl/d}} of conventional light, medium, and heavy crude, plus an additional {{convert|142|koilbbl/d}} of pentanes plus used for blending with heavy crude oil and bitumen to facilitate its transportation through pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Alberta. [http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/docs/aboutus/pdfs/Alberta_Energy_Overview.pdf Energy Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alberta exports over {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d}} of oil to US markets accounting for 10 per cent of US oil imports.
* The conventional oil resource is estimated to have approximately {{convert|1.6|Goilbbl}} of remaining established reserves.
*Conventional crude oil production (not including oil sands and [[pentanes plus]]) represented 38.6% of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production and 25.5% of Canada’s total crude oil and equivalent production.
*Alberta's oil sands reserve is considered to be one of the largest in the world, containing {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}} of bitumen initially in place.  Of this total, {{convert|174.5|Goilbbl}} are considered to be remaining established reserves, recoverable using current technology under present and anticipated economic conditions. To date, about 2% of the initial established resource has been produced.
* In 2003, total crude bitumen production in Alberta averaged {{convert|964|koilbbl/d}}.
* Disposition of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production in 2003 was approximately:
:* 62% to the United States
:* 24% within Alberta
:* 14% to the rest of Canada
* In 2003, Alberta produced {{convert|4.97|Tcuft}} of marketable natural gas.
* The average Albertan household uses {{convert|135|GJ}} of natural gas a year.
* Over 80 per cent of Canada’s natural gas production is from Alberta.
* In 2006, Alberta consumed {{convert|1.45|Tcuft}} of natural gas. The rest was exported across Canada and to the United States.
* Royalties to Alberta from natural gas and its byproducts are larger than royalties from crude oil and bitumen.
* In 2006, there were 13,473 successful natural gas wells drilled in Alberta: 12,029 conventional gas wells and 1,444 [[coalbed methane]] wells
* There may be up to {{convert|500|Tcuft}} of coalbed methane in Alberta, although it is unknown how much of this gas might be recoverable.
* Alberta has one of the most extensive natural gas systems in the world as part of its energy infrastructure, with {{convert|39000|km}} of energy related [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]].

=====Coal=====
[[File:Atlas coal mine.jpg|thumb|Remains of the former Atlas Coal Mine, near Drumheller, now a nation historic site.]]
{{See also|Coal in Canada}}
Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century. Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

The coal industry was vital to the early development of several communities, especially those in the foothills and along deep river valleys where coal was close to the surface.

Alberta is still a major coal producer, every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the [[Sky Dome]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;
 
Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation.  Alberta uses over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;
 
Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada's coal reserves are located in Alberta. This amounts to 33.6 [[Gigatonnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles, a short distance below the surface of the plains.  The coal belongs to the [[Cretaceous]] beds, and while not so heavy as that of the [[Coal Measures]] in England is of excellent quality{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.  In the valley of the [[Bow River]], alongside the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], valuable beds of [[anthracite]] coal are still worked.  The usual coal deposits of the are of [[bituminous]] or semi-bituminous coal.  These are largely worked at [[Lethbridge]] in southern Alberta and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in the centre of the province.  Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

=====Electricity=====
{{See also|Electricity policy in Alberta}}

{{As of|2007|06}}, Alberta's generating capacity was 11,919 [[Megawatt|MW]], and Alberta has about {{convert|21000|km}} of transmission lines.

Alberta has over 490 megawatts of [[wind power]] capacity.
 
Alberta has added 4400 MW of new supply since 1998 – that's equal to all the power generated in [[Saskatchewan]].
 
Winter peak for power use in one day was in November 2006 – 9,661 MW.
 
Summer peak for power use in one day was set on July 18, 2007 – 9,192 MW.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

====Mineral mining====

Building stones mined in Alberta include [[Rundle stone]], and [[Paskapoo sandstone]].

Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958, and many stones have been found since, although to date no large-scale mines have been developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

====Manufacturing====
The Edmonton area, and in particular [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]] is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment.  As well Edmonton's [[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]] is home to a petrochemical industry.

====Biotechnology====
Several companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta, for example [[ColdFX]].

====Food processing====
Owing to the strength of agriculture, food processing was one a major part of the economies of Edmonton and Calgary, but this sector has increasingly moved to smaller centres such as [[Brooks, Alberta|Brooks]], the home of [[Lakeside Packers]].

====Transportation====
[[File:WestJetHQ.jpg|thumb|400px|Headquarters of the airline [[WestJet]], in Calgary.]]
Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities, hence the nickname &quot;Gateway to the North&quot;.  Edmonton is one [[CN Rail]]'s most important hubs.  Since 1996, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] has its headquarters in downtown Calgary.

[[WestJet]], Canada's second largest air carrier, is headquartered in Calgary, by [[Calgary International Airport]], which serves as the airline's primary hub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c3dsp.westjet.com/guest/contacts/contactUs.jsp;jsessionid=g7RhKJ4H9Rvpn1VJBLFv4GZpJFpLFY1THj2vRHZJPSdwKyRB1mPG!-1091378010 Contact Us].

===Agriculture and forestry===

In the past, [[cattle]], [[horses]], and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used.  [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other mixed farming.

[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 Alberta Livestock Inspections - August 2006] - Alberta Government, Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].

[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grain elevator in [[southern Alberta]]]]

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.
{{See also|Agriculture in Canada|Pulp and paper industry in Canada}}

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

In 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.

===Services===
Despite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services.

====Finance====
Calgary is head office for many major oil and gas related companies, and many financial service business have grown up around them.

Edmonton is the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: [[Canadian Western Bank]], and [[ATB Financial]].

====Government====
Despite Alberta's reputation as a &quot;small government&quot; province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues.

[[Baron]] '''Augustin-Louis Cauchy''' (21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857; {{IPA-fr|oɡystɛ̃  lwi koʃi}}) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] who was an early pioneer of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. He started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the [[generality of algebra]] exploited by earlier authors. He defined [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s and gave several important theorems in [[complex analysis]] and initiated the study of [[permutation group]]s in [[abstract algebra]]. A profound mathematician, Cauchy exercised a great influence over his contemporaries and successors. His writings cover the entire range of mathematics and [[mathematical physics]].

Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks. He was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], strict ([[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]) royalist, and a close associate of the [[Jesuit order]].

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Cauchy's father ([[Louis François Cauchy]]) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New Régime. He lost his position because of the [[French Revolution]] (July 14, 1789) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born.&lt;ref&gt;His father's dismissal is sometimes seen as the cause of the deep hatred of the French Revolution that Cauchy felt all through his life.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following [[Reign of Terror]] (1794) by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first education, from his father. After the execution of [[Robespierre]] (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris. There Louis-François Cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job, and quickly moved up the ranks. When [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to power (1799), Louis-François Cauchy was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The famous mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] was also no stranger in the Cauchy family.

On Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the ''[[École Centrale du Panthéon]]'', the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802. Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and Humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the ''[[École Polytechnique]]''.

In 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted. One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the ''[[École des Ponts et Chaussées]]'' (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.

===Engineering days===
After finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis stayed for three years, and although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the ''Première Classe'' (First Class) of the ''[[Institut de France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In the revolutionary years the French ''Académie des Sciences'' was known as the &quot;First Class&quot; of the ''Institut de France''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on [[regular polyhedron|polyhedra]]) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of [[conic sections]]) was rejected.

In September 1812, now 23 years old, after becoming ill from overwork, Cauchy returned to Paris. Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of [[symmetric functions]], the [[symmetric group]] and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France, but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king [[Louis XVIII]] (a brother of the beheaded [[Louis XVI]]) took the restoration in hand. The ''[[Académie des Sciences]]'' was re-established in March 1816; [[Lazare Carnot]] and [[Gaspard Monge]] were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction by Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered his acceptance of membership of the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.

===Professor at École Polytechnique===
In November 1815, [[Louis Poinsot]], who was an associate professor at the École Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s [[polygonal number theorem]]. However, the fact that Cauchy was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted to full professor.

When Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Aloïse de Bure, five years his junior. She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy's works. They were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie Françoise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy, who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and Eugène François Cauchy, a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.

The oppressive political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother [[Charles X]]. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross appointments at the [[Collège de France]], and the Faculté des Sciences of the University.

===In exile===
In July 1830 France underwent another revolution. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king [[Louis-Philippe]] (of the [[House of Orléans]]). Riots, in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris.

These events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind. He spent a short time at [[Fribourg]] in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the [[King of Sardinia]] (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832-1833. In 1831, he had been elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux [[Henri d'Artois]] (1820–1883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X. As a professor of the École Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.

During his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of telling his pupil this; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying that Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a life-long dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to [[Baron]], a title that Cauchy set great store by. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family, after four years of exile.

===Last years===
Cauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838. He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance. However, he desperately wanted to regain a formal position in Parisian science.

[[File:Augustin-Louis Cauchy.jpg|thumb|left|Cauchy prior to 1857]]
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the ''[[Bureau des Longitudes]]''. This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could &quot;forget&quot; about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea - mainly the [[longitude|longitudinal]] coordinate, since [[latitude]] is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.

In November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to [[celestial mechanics]]. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. The absurd membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.

All through the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled with the separation of Church and State. The Catholic Church strived for freedom of education (that is, the right to establish Catholic schools); the Church found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally in this struggle. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the ''[[École Normale Écclésiastique]]'', a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took part in the founding of the ''[[Institut Catholique]]''. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported [[the Enlightenment]] ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the  Collège de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.

The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President became the Emperor of France, and took the name [[Napoleon III]].

Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67. He received the [[Last Sacraments]] and died at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. during the night of May 23, 1857.

==Work==
===Early work===
The genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the [[problem of Apollonius]]—describing a [[circle]] touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] on [[polyhedra]] in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on [[wave]] propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] and discovered many of the basic formulas for [[q-series]]. The theory of numbers and complex quantities; he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. The theory of groups and substitutions; and the theory of functions, differential equations, and determinants.

===Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity===
In the theory of light he worked on [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel's]] wave theory and on the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light. &lt;!-- In [[optics]], he developed the wave theory, and his name is associated with the simple dispersion formula. Exactly which formula? --&gt; He also contributed significant research in [[mechanics]], substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introduced&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, ''De la pression ou tension dans un corps solide'', [On the pressure or tension in a solid body], Exercices de Mathématiques, vol. '''2''', p. 42 (1827)&lt;/ref&gt; a 3 × 3 symmetric [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of numbers that is now known as the [[Stress (mechanics)#Cauchy's stress principle|Cauchy stress tensor]]. In [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], he originated the theory of [[stress (physics)|stress]], and his results are nearly as valuable as those of [[Simeon Poisson]]. Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]].

===Complex functions===
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of [[complex function theory]]. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as ''[[Cauchy's integral theorem]]'', was the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \oint_C f(z)dz = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''(''z'') is a complex-valued function [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve ''C'' (contour) lying in the [[complex plane]]. The ''contour integral'' is  taken along the contour ''C''. The rudiments of this theorem can  already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called &quot;First Class of the Institute&quot;) on August 11, 1814. In full form&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, ''Mémoire sur les intégrales définies prises entre des limites imaginaires'' [Memorandum on definite integrals taken between imaginary limits], submitted to the Académie des Sciences on February 28, 1825&lt;/ref&gt; the theorem was given in 1825. The 1825 paper is seen by many as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics.

In 1826&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, ''Sur  un nouveau genre de calcul analogue au calcul infinitésimal'' [On a new type of calculus analogous to the infinitesimal calculus], Exercices de Mathématique, vol. '''1''', p. 11 (1826)&lt;/ref&gt; Cauchy gave a formal definition of a [[residue (mathematics)|residue]] of a function. This concept regards functions that have [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s—isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') can be expanded in the [[neighborhood]]  of a singularity ''a'' as

:&lt;math&gt;
f(z) = \phi(z) + \frac{B_1}{z-a} + \frac{B_2}{(z-a)^2} + \cdots + \frac{B_n}{(z-a)^n},\quad
B_i, z,a \in \mathbb{C},
&lt;/math&gt;

where φ(''z'') is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then ''f'' is said to have  a pole of order ''n'' in the point ''a''. If ''n'' = 1, the pole is called simple.
The coefficient ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called by Cauchy the residue of function ''f'' at ''a''. If ''f'' is non-singular at ''a'' then the residue of ''f'' is zero at ''a''. Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to,
:&lt;math&gt;
\underset{z=a}{\mathrm{Res}} f(z) = \lim_{z \rightarrow a} (z-a) f(z),
&lt;/math&gt;
where we replaced ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by the modern notation of the residue.

In 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, ''Sur la mécanique céleste et sur un nouveau calcul qui s'applique à un grande nombre de questions diverses'' [On the celestial mechanics and on a new calculus that can be applied to a great number of diverse questions], presented to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, October 11, 1831.&lt;/ref&gt; he proposed the formula now known as [[Cauchy's integral formula]],
:&lt;math&gt;
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz,
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f''(''z'') is analytic on ''C'' and within the region bounded by the contour ''C'' and the complex number ''a'' is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at ''z'' = ''a''. In the second paper&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, ''Mémoire sur les rapports qui existent entre le calcul des Résidus et le calcul des Limites, et sur les avantages qu'offrent ces deux calculs dans la résolution des équations algébriques ou transcendantes'' Memorandum on the connections that exist between the residue calculus and the limit calculus, and on the advantages that these two calculi offer in solving algebraic and transcendental equations], presented to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, November 27, 1831.&lt;/ref&gt; he presented the [[residue theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C f(z) dz = \sum_{k=1}^n \underset{z=a_k}{\mathrm{Res}} f(z), 
&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is over all the ''n'' poles of ''f''(''z'') on and within the contour ''C''. These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with [[Pierre-Alphonse Laurent]] being the first mathematician, besides Cauchy, making a substantial contribution (his [[Laurent series]] published in 1843).

===Cours d'Analyse===
[[Image:Cauchy.jpg|left|thumb|The title page of a textbook by Cauchy.]] In addition to his work on complex functions, Cauchy was the first to stress the importance of rigor in analysis; he clarified the principles of the calculus by developing them with the aid of [[infinitesimal]]s, [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]], and continuity.  He defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d'Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  Namely, such a null sequence &quot;becomes&quot; an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and [[Lazare Carnot]]'s terminology.  He defined continuity of ''f'' as follows: ''f'' is continuous between two bounds if for every ''x'' between those bounds and every infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the values &lt;math&gt;f(x+\alpha)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are also infinitesimal.   He used an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type [[Dirac delta function|delta function]] &lt;math&gt;\delta_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\int F(x)\delta_\alpha(x) = F(0)&lt;/math&gt; in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989).  Both Laugwitz and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) have exposed a number of misconceptions in the literature concerning Cauchy's foundational work.  Some of the most common ones are reproduced below in italics.

1. ''Bolzano, Cauchy, and Weierstrass are all gardeners contributing to the ripening of the fruit of the notion of limit''.

Here the implicit assumption is that the Weierstrassian notion of &quot;limit&quot; in the
context of an
Archimedean continuum is the centerpiece of any possible edifice of analysis.  Thus, Boyer (1949, p.&amp;nbsp;277) postulates that Cauchy is working with a notion of limit similar to the Weierstrassian one.  Such an assumption is questionable on two counts.  First, as Felix Klein pointed out in 1908, there are two parallel threads in the development of analysis, one based on an Archimedean continuum, and the other exploiting an infinitesimal-enriched continuum.  One risks pre-judging the outcome of any analysis of Cauchy by postulating that he is working in the Archimedean thread.  The second implicit assumption is that the Weierstrassian notion of limit is central in Cauchy.  This requires further argument, and at least at first sight is incorrect: Cauchy emphasizes infinitesimals as a foundational notion, but he never emphasizes limits as a
foundational notion.  Thus, in Cauchy's definition of continuity the word &quot;limit&quot; does occur, but only in the sense of the &quot;endpoint&quot; of the interval of definition of the function, rather than the behavior of its values.

2. ''Cauchy, along with other mathematicians, abandoned infinitesimals in favor of other more rigorous notions''.  This is reported in the name of Deledicq.

During the period 1815-1820, Cauchy appears to have been ambivalent about
infinitesimals.  Starting in about 1820, he uses them with increasing
frequency both in his textbooks and his research publications, and insists on
the centrality of infinitesimals as a foundational notion.

3. ''Cauchy was forced to teach infinitesimals at the Ecole''.

The implication is that Cauchy only used infinitesimals because of the pressure
from the Ecole administration.
During the period 1815-1820 there were some tensions with the administration
over the delayed appearance of infinitesimals in the syllabus.  At any rate,
Cauchy
continued using infinitesimals throughout his career and long after completing
his teaching stint at the Ecole.  Thus he reproduces his 1821 definition of
continuity (in terms of infinitesimals) as late as 1853, in his text on the
famous &quot;sum theorem&quot;.

4. ''Cauchy based his infinitesimals on the notion of limit''.

This is an ambiguous claim, and essentially a play on words on the term &quot;limit&quot;.
The modern audience understands &quot;limit&quot; as a Weierstrass [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(ε, δ)-definition]].  If this is
what is claimed, then the claim is false.  As far as the kinetic notion of
limit that Cauchy does mention in discussing a variable quantity approaching a
limit, it is conspicuously absent in Cauchy's discussion of infinitesimals.
Thus, rather than infinitesimals being based on the notion of limit, it is the
notion of a variable quantity that's primitive, and both infinitesimals and
limits are defined in terms of it.  Note again that the term &quot;limit&quot; does
appear in
Cauchy's definition of continuity, but in an entirely different sense, namely
endpoint of the interval where the function is defined.

5. ''Cauchy introduced rigor into infinitesimals that anticipates the rigor of Weierstrass''.

While Cauchy certainly emphasizes rigor, postulating a
continuity between Cauchy's rigor and Weierstrassian rigor is a methodological
error; again
see Klein's comment on the two strands.  To Cauchy, rigor meant abandoning the
principle of the
&quot;generality of algebra&quot; as practiced by Euler, Lagrange, and others, and its replacement
by geometry—and by infinitesimals.

===Taylor's theorem===
He was the first to prove [[Taylor's theorem]] rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder. He wrote a textbook&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, Cours d'Analyse de l'École Royale Polytechnique, I.&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; partie, Analyse Algébrique, Paris (1821)&lt;/ref&gt; (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a [[limit of a function|limit]] in the form that is still taught.&lt;!-- which is epsilon delta? --&gt; Also Cauchy's well-known test for [[absolute convergence]] stems from this book: [[Cauchy condensation test]]. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy, Leçons sur le Calcul Différentiel, Paris (1829)&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods;&lt;ref&gt;Morris Kline, ''Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty'', ISBN 0-19-503085-0, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a &quot;counter-example&quot; by [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]], later fixed by the introduction of the notion of [[uniform continuity]].

===Argument principle,  stability===
In a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the &quot;[[Argument principle|Argument Principle]]&quot; in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the [[Cauchy argument principle]] is quite frequently used to derive the [[Nyquist stability criterion]], which can be used to predict the stability of negative [[feedback amplifier]] and negative [[feedback]] control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.

===Output===
Cauchy was very productive, in number of papers second only to [[Leonhard Euler]]. It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes:
* ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/notice?N=FRBNF30207318 Oeuvres complètes d'Augustin Cauchy publiées sous la direction scientifique de l'Académie des sciences et sous les auspices de M. le ministre de l'Instruction publique (27 volumes)]'' (Paris : Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1882–1974)
His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises:
* ''[http://mathdoc.emath.fr/cgi-bin/oeitem?id=OE_CAUCHY_2_3_P5_0 Cours d'analyse de l'École royale polytechnique] (1821)''
* ''Le Calcul infinitésimal'' (1823)
* ''Leçons sur les applications de calcul infinitésimal''; ''La géométrie'' (1826–1828)

==Politics and religious beliefs==
Augustin Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist. This made his father flee with the family to [[Arcueil]] during the [[French Revolution]]. Their life there was apparently hard and Lois-François Cauchy spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis-François to his mother in [[Rouen]], cited by C A Valson in ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=vQ7tw0rVKPsC La Vie et les Travaux du baron Cauchy]'' (Volume 1, Pg 13) says:
{{quote|We never had more than a half pound of bread — and sometimes not even that. This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted. Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little. I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land. I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of [[potato starch]]. It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children. It, too, was grown on my own land (9).&lt;ref&gt;

In any event he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.

He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03457a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Augustin-Louis Cauchy |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1908-11-01 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had links to the [[Society of Jesus]] and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for [[Charles Hermite]] during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the [[Great Irish Famine|Potato Famine]].

His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. [[Niels Henrik Abel]] called him a &quot;bigoted Catholic&quot;{{fact|date=March 2011}} and added he was &quot;mad and there is nothing that can be done about him,&quot; but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when [[Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja]] was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by [[Joseph Liouville]] which caused a rift between him and Cauchy. Another dispute concerned Jean Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], that he was in the wrong.

'''Archimedes of Syracuse''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{polytonic|[[wikt:Ἀρχιμήδης|Ἀρχιμήδης]]}}; ''c.'' 287&amp;nbsp;BC – ''c.'' 212&amp;nbsp;BC) was a [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[engineer]], [[inventor]], and [[astronomer]]. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading [[scientist]]s in [[classical antiquity]]. Among his advances in [[physics]] are the foundations of [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[statics]] and an explanation of the principle of the [[lever]]. He is credited with designing innovative [[machine]]s, including siege engines and the [[Archimedes' screw|screw pump]] that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested claims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors.&lt;ref name=&quot;death ray&quot;/&gt;

Archimedes is generally considered to be the greatest [[mathematician]] of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calinger |first=Ronald |title=A Contextual History of Mathematics |year=1999 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-02-318285-7 |page=150 |quote=Shortly after Euclid, compiler of the definitive textbook, came Archimedes of Syracuse (ca. 287&amp;nbsp;212 BC), the most original and profound mathematician of antiquity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Archimedes.html |title=Archimedes of Syracuse |accessdate=2008-06-09 |publisher=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive |month=January|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[pi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A history of calculus |author=O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |month= February|year= 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also defined the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name, formulae for the [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]] and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers.

Archimedes died during the [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] when he was killed by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. [[Cicero]] describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a [[sphere]] [[inscribe]]d within a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. Archimedes had proven that the sphere has two thirds of the volume and surface area of the cylinder (including the bases of the latter), and regarded this as the greatest of his mathematical achievements.

Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from [[Alexandria]] read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until ''c.'' 530&amp;nbsp;AD by [[Isidore of Miletus]], while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the [[Middle Ages]] were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Galileo, Archimedes, and Renaissance engineers |author=Bursill-Hall, Piers|publisher = sciencelive with the University of Cambridge| url = http://www.sciencelive.org/component/option,com_mediadb/task,view/idstr,CU-MMP-PiersBursillHall/Itemid,30|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes – The Palimpsest|publisher =[[Walters Art Museum]]|url = http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Gerhard Thieme Archimedes.jpg|thumb|right|This bronze statue of Archimedes is at the [[Archenhold Observatory]] in [[Berlin]]. It was sculpted by Gerhard Thieme and unveiled in 1972.]]

Archimedes was born ''c''. 287&amp;nbsp;BC in the seaport city of [[Syracuse, Sicily]], at that time a self-governing [[Colonies in antiquity|colony]] in [[Magna Graecia]]. The date of birth is based on a statement by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] historian [[John Tzetzes]] that Archimedes lived for 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T. L.]], ''Works of Archimedes'', 1897&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an [[astronomer]] about whom nothing is known. [[Plutarch]] wrote in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' that Archimedes was related to King [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the ruler of Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|name| lives|title = ''Parallel Lives'' Complete e-text from Gutenberg.org|author=[[Plutarch]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]| url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/674|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure.&lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.|url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Archimedes.html|title = Archimedes of Syracuse|publisher = University of St Andrews|accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth Archimedes may have studied in [[Alexandria]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], where [[Conon of Samos]] and [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (''[[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'' and the ''[[Archimedes' cattle problem|Cattle Problem]]'') have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}

Archimedes died ''c''. 212&amp;nbsp;BC during the [[Second Punic War]], when Roman forces under General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long [[siege]]. According to the popular account given by [[Plutarch]], Archimedes was contemplating a [[mathematical diagram]] when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a {{nowrap|lesser-known}} account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html|title = Death of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]|accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A [[sphere]] and [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.]]

The last words attributed to Archimedes are &quot;Do not disturb my circles&quot; ({{lang-el|μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε}}), a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in [[Latin]] as &quot;Noli turbare circulos meos,&quot; but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot;/&gt;

The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a [[sphere]] and a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75&amp;nbsp;BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman [[orator]] [[Cicero]] was serving as [[quaestor]] in [[Sicily]]. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tomb discovered in a hotel courtyard in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but its location today is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/TombIllus.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes - Illustrations|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate = 2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by [[Polybius]] in his ''Universal History'' was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and [[Livy]]. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html|title = Siege of Syracuse| publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate = 2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries and inventions==
===The Golden Crown===
[[File:Archimedes water balance.gif|thumb|right|180px|Archimedes may have used his principle of buoyancy to determine whether the golden crown was less [[density|dense]] than solid gold.]]

The most widely known [[anecdote]] about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to [[Vitruvius]], a [[votive crown]] for a temple had been made for King Hiero II, who had supplied the pure [[gold]] to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some [[silver]] had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''De Architectura'', Book IX, paragraphs 9–12, text in English and Latin|author= [[Vitruvius]]| publisher = [[University of Chicago]]|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html|accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its [[density]].
While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Incompressibility of Water|publisher =[[Harvard University]]|url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying &quot;[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!&quot; ([[Greek language|Greek]]: &quot;εὕρηκα!,&quot; meaning &quot;I have found it!&quot;). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Buoyancy|author= [[HyperPhysics]]| publisher =[[Georgia State University]]|url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/pbuoy.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaccuracy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html|title = The Golden Crown|publisher = [[Drexel University]]|accessdate = 2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in [[fluid statics|hydrostatics]] as [[Buoyancy|Archimedes' Principle]], which he describes in his treatise ''On Floating Bodies''. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Archimedes' Principle''|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll |publisher=[[Weber State University]]|url =http://www.physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/principle.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. If the crown was less dense than gold, it would displace more water due to its larger volume, and thus experience a greater buoyant force than the reference sample. This difference in buoyancy would cause the scale to tip accordingly. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] considered it &quot;probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;galileo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/bilancetta.html|title = The Golden Crown: Galileo's Balance|publisher = [[Drexel University]]|accessdate = 2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Archimedes Screw===
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|left|The [[Archimedes screw]] can raise water efficiently.]]
A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] described how King Hieron II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the ''[[Syracusia]]'', which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The ''Syracusia'' is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Casson|first= Lionel|authorlink= Lionel Casson|title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World|year=1971 |publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03536-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the [[Archimedes screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a {{nowrap|low-lying}} body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes screw described in Roman times by [[Vitruvius]] may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World''|author=Dalley, Stephanie.

===The Claw of Archimedes===
The [[Claw of Archimedes]] is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as &quot;the ship shaker,&quot; the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled ''Superweapons of the Ancient World'' built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|title = Archimedes' Claw – Illustrations and Animations – a range of possible designs for the claw| publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Claw/illustrations.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes' Claw – watch an animation|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll|publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/claw.htm|accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Archimedes Heat Ray===
[[File:Archimedes Heat Ray conceptual diagram.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].]]

The 2nd century AD author [[Lucian]] wrote that during the [[Siege of Syracuse (212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] (''c.'' 214–212&amp;nbsp;BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, [[Anthemius of Tralles]] mentions [[burning-glass]]es as Archimedes' weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''Hippias'', 2 (cf. [[Galen]], ''On temperaments'' 3.2, who mentions ''pyreia'', &quot;torches&quot;); [[Anthemius of Tralles]], ''On miraculous engines'' 153 [Westerman].&lt;/ref&gt; The device, sometimes called the &quot;Archimedes heat ray&quot;, was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire.

This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. [[René Descartes]] rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[John Wesley]] |url = http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/wesley_natural_philosophy/duten12.htm| title = ''A Compendium of Natural Philosophy'' (1810) Chapter XII, ''Burning Glasses''|publisher = Online text at Wesley Center for Applied Theology|accessdate = 2007-09-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012154432/http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/wesley_natural_philosophy/duten12.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished [[bronze]] or [[copper]] shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship. This would have used the principle of the [[parabolic reflector]] in a manner similar to a [[solar furnace]].

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the [[Skaramagas]] naval base outside [[Athens]]. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1&amp;nbsp;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood {{nowrap|mock-up}} of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&amp;nbsp;feet (50&amp;nbsp;m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of [[bitumen|tar]] paint, which may have aided combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Archimedes' Weapon| publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date = November 26, 1973| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908175,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005 a group of students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a {{nowrap|mock-up}} wooden ship at a range of around 100&amp;nbsp;feet (30&amp;nbsp;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in [[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its [[autoignition temperature]], which is around 300 °C (570&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How Wildfires Work|author= Bonsor, Kevin| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html Fuels and Chemicals – Auto Ignition Temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''MythBusters'' broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of &quot;busted&quot; (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. ''MythBusters'' also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.&lt;ref name=&quot;death ray&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes Death Ray: Testing with MythBusters|publisher = MIT| url = http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ''MythBusters'' again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition featuring [[Barack Obama]], entitled ''President's Challenge''. Several experiments were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a {{nowrap|mock-up}} of a Roman sailing ship 400&amp;nbsp;feet (120&amp;nbsp;m) away. In all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210 °C (410&amp;nbsp;°F) required to catch fire, and the verdict was again &quot;busted&quot;. The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding, dazzling, or distracting the crew of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;death ray2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = TV Review: MythBusters 8.27 – President’s Challenge| url = http://fandomania.com/tv-review-mythbusters-8-27-presidents-challenge/|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discoveries and inventions===

While Archimedes did not invent the [[lever]], he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work ''On the Equilibrium of Planes''. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the [[Peripatetic school]] of the followers of [[Aristotle]], and are sometimes attributed to [[Archytas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lever rorres&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverLaw.html|title = The Law of the Lever According to Archimedes|publisher = [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]|accessdate = 2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lever clagett&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Marshall |last=Clagett|url = http://books.google.com/?id=mweWMAlf-tEC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=archytas+lever&amp;q=archytas%20lever| title = Greek Science in Antiquity| publisher = Dover Publications|accessdate = 2010-03-20 |isbn=978-0-486-41973-2 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pappus of Alexandria]], Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: &quot;Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.&quot; ({{lang-el|δῶς μοι πᾶ στῶ καὶ τὰν γᾶν κινάσω}})&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] in ''Synagoge'', Book VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed [[block and tackle|block-and-tackle]] [[pulley]] systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of [[lever]]age to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dougherty, F. C.; Macari, J.; Okamoto, C.|title = Pulleys|publisher=[[Society of Women Engineers]]|url = http://www.swe.org/iac/lp/pulley_03.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the [[catapult]], and with inventing the [[odometer]] during the [[First Punic War]]. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/5/55.html| title = Ancient Greek Scientists: Hero of Alexandria|publisher = Technology Museum of Thessaloniki|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] (106–43&amp;nbsp;BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his [[dialogue]] ''[[De re publica]]'', which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129&amp;nbsp;BC. After the capture of Syracuse ''c.'' 212&amp;nbsp;BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:

{{quote|Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione. — When Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth, when the Sun was in line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''De re publica'' 1.xiv §21|author= [[Cicero]]| publisher =thelatinlibrary.com|url = http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =''De re publica'' Complete e-text in English from Gutenberg.org|author=[[Cicero]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a description of a [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]]. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled {{nowrap|''[[On Sphere-Making]]''}}. Modern research in this area has been focused on the [[Antikythera mechanism]], another device from classical antiquity that was probably designed for the same purpose. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]]. This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Spheres and Planetaria |first=Chris |last=Rorres|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Sphere/SphereIntro.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Ancient Moon 'computer' revisited|publisher = BBC News|date = November 29, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6191462.stm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. [[Plutarch]] wrote: &quot;He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Extract from ''Parallel Lives''|author= [[Plutarch]]| publisher = fulltextarchive.com| url = http://fulltextarchive.com/pages/Plutarch-s-Lives10.php#p35|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi]].]]

Archimedes was able to use [[infinitesimal]]s in a way that is similar to modern [[Integral|integral calculus]]. Through proof by contradiction ([[reductio ad absurdum]]), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and he employed it to approximate the value of pi. He did this by drawing a larger [[polygon]] outside a [[circle]] and a smaller polygon inside the circle. As the number of sides of the polygon increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. When the polygons had 96 sides each, he calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of pi lay between 3{{frac|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and 3{{frac|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the [[area]] of a circle was equal to pi multiplied by the [[square (geometry)|square]] of the [[radius]] of the circle. In ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]'', Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the [[Archimedean property]] of real numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedean ordered fields|author= Kaye, R.W.| publisher = web.mat.bham.ac.uk| url = http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/seqser/archfields|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'', Archimedes gives the value of the [[square root]] of 3 as lying between {{frac|265|153}} (approximately 1.7320261) and {{frac|1351|780}} (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of the method used to obtain it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused [[John Wallis]] to remark that he was: &quot;as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heath, T. L. ''Works of Archimedes'', Dover Publications, ISBN 0-486-42084-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parabolic segment and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|right|As proven by Archimedes, the area of the [[parabole|parabolic]] segment in the upper figure is equal to 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle in the lower figure.]]
In ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'', Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is {{frac|4|3}} times the area of a corresponding inscribed [[triangle]] as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an [[Series (mathematics)#History of the theory of infinite series|infinite]] [[geometric series]] with the [[Geometric series#Common ratio|common ratio]] {{frac|1|4}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3}. \;&lt;/math&gt;

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller [[secant line]]s, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series {{nowrap|[[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]]}} which sums to {{frac|1|3}}.

In ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: &quot;There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]]), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.&quot; To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the [[myriad]]. The word is from the Greek {{polytonic|μυριάς}} ''murias'', for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 [[Names of large numbers|vigintillion]], or 8{{e|63}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Sand Reckoner |first=Bradley W |last=Carroll|publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/sand.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
The works of Archimedes were written in [[Doric Greek]], the dialect of ancient [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of ancient Greece By Wilson, Nigel Guy  [http://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA77 p. 77] ISBN 0-7945-0225-3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The written work of Archimedes has not survived as well as that of [[Euclid]], and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through references made to them by other authors. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] mentions ''[[On Sphere-Making]]'' and another work on [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], while [[Theon of Alexandria]] quotes a remark about [[refraction]] from the {{nowrap|now-lost}} ''Catoptrica''.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in [[Alexandria]]. The writings of Archimedes were collected by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] architect [[Isidore of Miletus]] (''c''. 530&amp;nbsp;AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (836–901&amp;nbsp;AD), and Latin by [[Gerard of Cremona]] (''c.'' 1114–1187&amp;nbsp;AD). During the [[Renaissance]], the ''Editio Princeps'' (First Edition) was published in [[Basel]] in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Editions of Archimedes' Work|publisher = Brown University Library| url = http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/math/wholefr.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 1586 [[Galileo Galilei]] invented a hydrostatic balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Galileo Project: Hydrostatic Balance|author=Van Helden, Al|publisher = [[Rice University]]| url = http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/balance.html|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surviving works===
[[File:Archimedes lever (Small).jpg|thumb|right|Archimedes is said to have remarked of the [[lever]]: ''Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.'']]
*''On the Equilibrium of Planes'' (two volumes)
:The first book is in fifteen propositions with seven [[Axiom|postulates]], while the second book is in ten propositions. In this work Archimedes explains the ''[[Torque|Law of the Lever]]'', stating, &quot;Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.&quot;
:Archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]] of various geometric figures including [[triangle]]s, [[parallelogram]]s and [[parabola]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;works&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author =Heath, T.L.|url = http://www.archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp|title = The Works of Archimedes (1897). The unabridged work in PDF form (19&amp;nbsp;MB)| publisher = [[Internet Archive|Archive.org]]|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Measurement of a Circle|On the Measurement of a Circle]]''
:This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of [[Conon of Samos]]. In Proposition II, Archimedes shows that the value of pi ({{pi}}) is greater than {{frac|223|71}} and less than {{frac|22|7}}. The latter figure was used as an approximation of pi throughout the Middle Ages and is still used today when only a rough figure is required.
*''[[On Spirals]]''
:This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [[Archimedean spiral]]. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [[angular velocity]]. Equivalently, in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] ({{math|''r''}}, {{math|θ}}) it can be described by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;\, r=a+b\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:with [[real number]]s {{math|a}} and {{math|b}}. This is an early example of a [[Curve|mechanical curve]] (a curve traced by a moving [[point (geometry)|point]]) considered by a Greek mathematician.
*''On the Sphere and the Cylinder'' (two volumes)
:In this treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a [[sphere]] and a [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and [[diameter]]. The volume is {{frac|4|3}}{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the sphere, and 2{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the cylinder. The surface area is 4{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the sphere, and 6{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the cylinder (including its two bases), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere and cylinder. The sphere has a volume {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the circumscribed cylinder. Similarly, the sphere has an area  {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the cylinder (including the bases). A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.
*''On Conoids and Spheroids''
:This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [[cross section (geometry)|sections]] of [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], spheres, and paraboloids.
*''On Floating Bodies'' (two volumes)
:In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [[Eratosthenes]] that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap|self-gravitating}}, since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.

:In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float. [[Archimedes' principle]] of buoyancy is given in the work, stated as follows: {{quote|Any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in sense to, the weight of the fluid displaced.}}
*''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''
:In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a [[triangle]] with equal base and height. He achieves this by calculating the value of a [[geometric series]] that sums to infinity with the [[ratio]] {{frac|1|4}}.
*''[[Ostomachion|(O)stomachion]]''
:This is a [[dissection puzzle]] similar to a [[Tangram]], and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [[square (geometry)|square]]. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of [[Stanford University]] in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = In Archimedes' Puzzle, a New Eureka Moment|author= Kolata, Gina| publisher =[[The New York Times]] |date = December 14, 2003| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E6DD133CF937A25751C1A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Loculus of Archimedes, Solved|author= Ed Pegg Jr.| publisher =[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date = November 17, 2003| url = http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_11_17_03.html|accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in [[combinatorics]].

*''[[Archimedes' cattle problem]]''
:This work was discovered by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in [[Wolfenbüttel]], [[Germany]] in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be [[square number]]s. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor&lt;ref&gt;Krumbiegel, B. and Amthor, A. ''Das Problema Bovinum des Archimedes'', Historisch-literarische Abteilung der Zeitschrift Für Mathematik und Physik 25 (1880) pp. 121–136, 153–171.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271{{e|206544}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Keith G |last=Calkins|url = http://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/profess/cattle.htm|title = Archimedes' Problema Bovinum| publisher = [[Andrews University]]|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''
:In this treatise, Archimedes counts the number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe. This book mentions the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System|solar system]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]], as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the [[myriad]], Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8{{e|63}} in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. ''The Sand Reckoner'' or ''Psammites'' is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =English translation of ''The Sand Reckoner'' |publisher = [[University of Waterloo]]| url = http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''
:This treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|infinitesimals]], and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the [[method of exhaustion]] to derive the results. As with ''The Cattle Problem'', ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' was written in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes in [[Alexandria]].

===Apocryphal works===
Archimedes' ''[[Book of Lemmas]]'' or ''Liber Assumptorum'' is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The scholars [[T. L. Heath]] and [[Marshall Clagett]] argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The ''Lemmas'' may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes' Book of Lemmas| publisher = [[cut-the-knot]]| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/BookOfLemmas/index.shtml|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that [[Heron's formula]] for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} However, the first reliable reference to the formula is given by [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Heron of Alexandria |author=O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Heron.html|month= April|year= 1999|accessdate= 2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Archimedes Palimpsest}}
[[File:Stomachion.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Ostomachion|Stomachion]]'' is a [[dissection puzzle]] in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]].]]

The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] visited [[Constantinople]] and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered that it was a [[palimpsest]], a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as [[vellum]] was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reading Between the Lines|author= Miller, Mary K.| publisher= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]| month= March|year= 2007| url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/archimedes.html| accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at [[Christie's]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Rare work by Archimedes sells for $2 million|publisher = [[CNN]]|date = October 29, 1998| url = http://edition.cnn.com/books/news/9810/29/archimedes/|accessdate=2008-01-15| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080516000109/http://edition.cnn.com/books/news/9810/29/archimedes/| archivedate = May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of ''On Floating Bodies'' in the original Greek. It is the only known source of ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'', referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. ''Stomachion'' was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of [[ultraviolet]] and {{nowrap|[[x-ray]]}} [[light]] to read the overwritten text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = X-rays reveal Archimedes' secrets|publisher = BBC News|date = August 2, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5235894.stm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest are: ''On the Equilibrium of Planes, On Spirals, [[Measurement of a Circle]], On the Sphere and the Cylinder, On Floating Bodies, The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' and ''Stomachion''.

The [[asteroid]] [[3600 Archimedes]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planetary Data System |publisher=NASA |url=http://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/pds-explorer/index.jsp?selection=othertarget&amp;targname=3600%20ARCHIMEDES |accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fields Medal]] for outstanding achievement in mathematics carries a portrait of Archimedes, along with his proof concerning the sphere and the cylinder. The inscription around the head of Archimedes is a quote attributed to him which reads in Latin: &quot;Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri&quot; (Rise above oneself and grasp the world).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fields Medal |publisher=[[International Mathematical Union]] |url=http://www.mathunion.org/medals/Fields/AboutPhotos.html |accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070701033751/http://www.mathunion.org/medals/Fields/AboutPhotos.html| archivedate = July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archimedes has appeared on postage stamps issued by [[East Germany]] (1973), [[Greece]] (1983), [[Italy]] (1983), [[Nicaragua]] (1971), [[San Marino]] (1982), and [[Spain]] (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres |url=http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Stamps/stamps.html |title=Stamps of Archimedes |publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclamation of [[Eureka (word)|Eureka!]] attributed to Archimedes is the state motto of [[California]]. In this instance the word refers to the discovery of gold near [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 which sparked the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Symbols |publisher=California State Capitol Museum |url=http://www.capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?content1=1278&amp;Content2=1374&amp;Content3=1294 |accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A movement for civic engagement targeting universal access to health care in the US state of [[Oregon]] has been named the &quot;Archimedes Movement,&quot; headed by former Oregon Governor [[John Kitzhaber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archimedesmovement.org/|title=The Archimedes Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes and references==
===Notes===
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}}In the preface to ''On Spirals'' addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, Archimedes says that &quot;many years have elapsed since Conon's death.&quot; [[Conon of Samos]] lived {{nowrap|''c.'' 280–220 BC}}, suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}}The treatises by Archimedes known to exist only through references in the works of other authors are: ''[[On Sphere-Making]]'' and a work on polyhedra mentioned by Pappus of Alexandria; ''Catoptrica'', a work on optics mentioned by [[Theon of Alexandria]]; ''Principles'', addressed to Zeuxippus and explaining the number system used in ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''; ''On Balances and Levers''; ''On Centers of Gravity''; ''On the Calendar''. Of the surviving works by Archimedes, [[T. L. Heath]] offers the following suggestion as to the order in which they were written: ''On the Equilibrium of Planes I'', ''The Quadrature of the Parabola'', ''On the Equilibrium of Planes II'', ''On the Sphere and the Cylinder I, II'', ''On Spirals'', ''On Conoids and Spheroids'', ''On Floating Bodies I, II'', ''On the Measurement of a Circle'', ''The Sand Reckoner''.

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}}[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Boyer, Carl Benjamin]] ''A History of Mathematics'' (1991) ISBN 0-471-54397-7 &quot;Arabic scholars inform us that the familiar area formula for a triangle in terms of its three sides, usually known as Heron's formula — ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;√(''s''(''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'')(''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'')(''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''c'')), where ''s'' is the semiperimeter — was known to Archimedes several centuries before Heron lived. Arabic scholars also attribute to Archimedes the 'theorem on the broken [[chord (geometry)|chord]]'&amp;nbsp;… Archimedes is reported by the Arabs to have given several proofs of the theorem.&quot;

'''Alternative medicine''' is any healing practice &quot;that does not fall within the realm of conventional [[allopathic medicine | medicine]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=bratman7&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alternative Medicine Sourcebook |last=Bratman, MD |first=Steven |year=1997 |publisher=Lowell House |page=7|isbn=978-1-56565-626-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;that which has not been shown consistently to be effective.&quot;&lt;ref name=MFL/&gt; In some instances, it is based on historical or cultural traditions, rather than a scientific (e.g. evidence-based) basis. Critics assert that the terms “complementary” and “alternative medicine” are deceptive [[euphemism]]s meant to give an impression of medical authority.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll RT. [http://www.skepdic.com/compmed.html &quot;complementary medicine&quot;] at ''The Skeptic's Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APNEJM&gt;Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine, Science Based Medicine, Steven Novella, [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391 Science-Based Medicine » Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Credulityabout&quot;&gt;Credulity about acupuncture infiltrates the New England Journal of Medicine, Science Based Medicine, David Gorski, [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6381 Science-Based Medicine » Credulity about acupuncture infiltrates the New England Journal of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] has stated that &quot;there is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dawkins2/&gt;

The American [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM) studies examples including [[naturopathy]], [[chiropractic|chiropractic medicine]], [[herbalism]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Ayurveda]], [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[biofeedback]], [[hypnosis]], [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], and [[nutritional]]-based therapies, in addition to a range of other practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31077 Definition of Complementary medicine], ''MedicineNet.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is frequently grouped with '''complementary medicine''' or [[Integrative Medicine|'''integrative medicine''']], which generally refers to the same interventions when used in conjunction with mainstream techniques,&lt;ref name=&quot;whccamp.hhs.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy |url=http://whccamp.hhs.gov/fr2.html |chapter=Overview of CAM in the United States: Recent History, Current Status, And Prospects for the Future |date=March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Edzard Ernst|Ernst E.]] |title=Complementary medicine: Common misconceptions |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |year=1995 |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=244–247| pmid = 7636814|pmc=1295191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce CR |title=Placebo and complementary medicine |journal=[[Lancet]] |year=1994 |volume=344|issue=8932 |pages=1279–1281 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90757-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the umbrella term '''complementary and alternative medicine''', or ''CAM''.  Some researchers in alternative medicine oppose this grouping, preferring to emphasize differences of approach, but nevertheless use the term CAM, which has become standard.&lt;ref name=CassilethDeng2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR, Deng G |title=Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer |journal=[[The Oncologist]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=80–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14755017 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ernstinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harcourt-international.com/ernst/interview.cfm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070311015608/http://www.harcourt-international.com/ernst/interview.cfm |publisher=Elsevier Science |title=Interview with [[Edzard Ernst]], editor of ''The Desktop Guide to Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' |year=2002 |archivedate=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual. In addition, many CAM systems have characteristics commonly found in mainstream health care, such as a focus on good nutrition and preventive practices. Unlike mainstream medicine, CAM often lacks or has only limited experimental and clinical study; however, scientific investigation of CAM is beginning to address this knowledge gap. Thus, boundaries between CAM and mainstream medicine, as well as among different CAM systems, are often blurred and are constantly changing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whccamp.hhs.gov&quot;/&gt;

Alternative medicine practices are as diverse in their foundations as in their methodologies. Practices may incorporate or base themselves on  [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, or newly conceived approaches to healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu |year=2008 |title=Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices |publisher=Aavishkar Publishers Distributor |location=[[Jaipur]] |isbn=978-81-7910-252-7 |page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisdictions where alternative medical practices are sufficiently widespread may license and regulate them. The claims made by alternative medicine practitioners are generally not accepted by the [[Consensus (medical)|medical]] community because [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] assessment of safety and efficacy is either not available or has not been performed for these practices. If [[Biomedical research|scientific investigation]] establishes the safety and effectiveness of an alternative medical practice, it then becomes mainstream medicine and is no longer &quot;alternative&quot;, and may therefore become widely adopted by conventional practitioners.&lt;ref name=Angell&gt;{{cite journal |author=Angell M, Kassirer JP |title=Alternative medicine--the risks of untested and unregulated remedies |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=339 |issue=12 |pages=839–41 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9738094 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199809173391210 |url=http://kitsrus.com/pdf/nejm_998.pdf |quote=It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine -- conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whatiscam&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/| title=What is Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)? |accessdate=2006-07-11 |publisher=[[NCCAM|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5C1oRX8Qq | archivedate = 2005-12-08| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because alternative techniques tend to lack evidence, or may even have repeatedly failed to work in tests, some have advocated defining it as non-evidence based medicine, or not medicine at all. Some researchers state that the evidence-based approach to defining CAM is problematic because some CAM is tested, and research suggests that many mainstream medical techniques lack solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kopelman, Lorretta M. |chapter=The role of science in assessing conventional, complementary, and alternative medicines |title=The Role of Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Accommodating Pluralism |series-title=Hastings Center Studies in Ethics Series |editor=Callahan D |publisher=Georgetown University Press |location=Washington, DC |year=2004 |pages=36–53 |isbn=978-1-58901-016-1 |oclc=47791087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1998 [[systematic review]] of studies assessing its prevalence in 13 countries concluded that about 31% of cancer patients use some form of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Ernst_Cassileth&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E, Cassileth BR |title=The prevalence of complementary/alternative medicine in cancer: a systematic review |journal=Cancer |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=777–82 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9708945 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980815)83:4&lt;777::AID-CNCR22&gt;3.0.CO;2-O|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative medicine varies from country to country. [[Edzard Ernst]] says that in Austria and Germany CAM is mainly in the hands of physicians,&lt;ref name=&quot;ernstinterview&quot;/&gt; while some estimates suggest that at least half of American alternative practitioners are physicians.&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Barrie R. Cassileth|Cassileth, Barrie R.]] |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/1/3/173 |title=Alternative and Complementary Cancer Treatments |journal=The Oncologist |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=173–9 |date = June 1996|pmid=10387984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, herbs are tightly regulated, with half prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance based on their [[Commission E]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Complete German Commission E Monographs: Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines |author=Marty |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/281/19/1852 |journal=J Amer Med Assoc |year=1999 |volume=281 |pages=1852–3 |pmid= |doi=10.1001/jama.281.19.1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The term 'alternative medicine' is generally used to describe practices used independently or in place of conventional medicine. The term 'complementary medicine' is primarily used to describe practices used in conjunction with or to complement conventional medical treatments. NCCAM suggests &quot;using [[aromatherapy]] therapy in which the scent of essential oils from flowers, herbs, and trees is inhaled in an attempt to promote health and well-being and to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery&quot;&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt; as an example of complementary medicine. The terms 'integrative' or 'integrated medicine' indicate combinations of conventional and alternative medical treatments which have some scientific proof of efficacy; such practices are viewed by advocates as the best examples of complementary medicine.&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;

[[Ralph Snyderman]] and [[Andrew Weil]] state that &quot;integrative medicine is not synonymous with complementary and alternative medicine. It has a far larger meaning and mission in that it calls for restoration of the focus of medicine on health and healing and emphasizes the centrality of the patient-physician relationship.&quot;&lt;ref name=Snyderman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snyderman R, Weil AT |title=Integrative medicine: bringing medicine back to its roots |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11863470 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- WE CAN'T USE PROJECTIONS SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE FACT; ALSO, THE ESTIMATE IS UNCITED In 2002, the growth estimate during the years 1995 to 2005 in the USA and other developed countries for the number of chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and other nonphysician clinicians was double that of physicians.&lt;ref name=Cassileth&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cassileth, Barrie R. | title = The Role of Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine: Accommodating Pluralism | journal = NEJM | volume = 347 | pages = 860–861 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200209123471123}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  The combination of orthodox and complementary medicine with an emphasis on prevention and lifestyle changes is known as [[Index of alternative medicine articles#I|''integrated medicine'']].

==Characterization==

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM) defines CAM as &quot;a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products, that are not currently part of conventional medicine.&quot;&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;

The Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicine (Danish abbreviation: ViFAB. ViFAB is an independent institution under the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health. ViFAB's webstite: www.vifab.dk/uk) uses the term “alternative medicine” for:
- Treatments performed by therapists who are not authorized health care professionals.
- Treatments performed by authorized health care professionals, but which are based on methods otherwise mainly used outside the health care system. People without a health care authorisation must be able to perform the treatments.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] Complementary Medicine Field finds that what is considered complementary or alternative practices in one country may be considered conventional medical practices in another. Their definition is therefore general: &quot;complementary medicine includes all such practices and ideas which are outside the domain of conventional medicine in several countries and defined by its users as preventing or treating illness, or promoting health and well-being.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cochranedefinition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/CE000052/frame.html |title=Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field |work=Cochrane COllaboration |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[biofeedback]] is commonly used within the Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation community, but is considered alternative within the medical community as a whole, and some herbal therapies are mainstream in Europe, but are alternative in the United States.&lt;ref name=CompAltMentalHealth&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter R., PhD.

[[Barrie R.

=== Scientific community ===
;Institutions
The United States' [[National Science Foundation]] has defined alternative medicine as &quot;all treatments that have not been proven effective using scientific methods.&quot;&lt;ref name=NSF_altmed/&gt; In a consensus report released in 2005, entitled ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States'', the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) defined complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as the non-dominant approach to medicine in a given culture and historical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iom.edu/Reports/2005/Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-in-the-United-States.aspx |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States |publisher=United States [[Institute of Medicine]] |pages=16–20 |date=12 January 2005 |quote=Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed. |accessdate=2011-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar definition has been adopted by the Cochrane Collaboration,&lt;ref name=Cochranedefinition /&gt; and official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/Complementaryandalternativemedicine/index.htm |title=Complementary and alternative medicine : Department of Health - Public health |work=Department of Health |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of evidence-based medicine, such as the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], use the term alternative medicine but agree that all treatments, whether &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot;, ought to be held to the standards of the scientific method.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compmed.umm.edu/cochrane.asp |title=Cochrane CAM Field: Integrative Medicine |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Scientists
Numerous mainstream scientists and physicians have commented on and criticised alternative medicine.

There is a debate among medical researchers over whether any therapy may be properly classified as 'alternative medicine'.  Some claim that there is only medicine which has been adequately tested and that which has not.&lt;ref name=Angell/&gt; They feel that health care practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]].  If a treatment has been rigorously tested and found safe and effective traditional medicine will adopt it regardless of if it was considered alternative to begin with.&lt;ref name=Angell/&gt; It is thus possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. Prominent supporters of this position include [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).&lt;ref name=Fontanarosa&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fontanarosa PB, Lundberg GD |title=Alternative medicine meets science |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=18 |pages=1618–9 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9820267 |doi= 10.1001/jama.280.18.1618|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Barrett]], founder and operator of [[Quackwatch]], argues that practices labeled &quot;alternative&quot; should be reclassified as either genuine, experimental, or questionable. Here he defines genuine as being methods that have sound evidence for safety and effectiveness, experimental as being unproven but with a plausible rationale for effectiveness, and questionable as groundless without a scientifically plausible rationale.  He has concerns that just because some &quot;alternative&quot; have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Barrett|title=Be Wary of &quot;Alternative&quot; Health Methods|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altwary.html|work=[[Stephen Barrett|Stephen Barrett, M.D.]]|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|date=February 10, 2004 |accessdate = 2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He says that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.&lt;ref name=&quot;$2.5 billion&quot;/&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]], professor of complementary medicine, characterizes the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative, but states that evidence exists for others, in particular certain herbs and acupuncture.&lt;ref name=goodbadugly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html |title=Complementary medicine: the good the bad and the ugly |work=Edzard Ernst |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], an evolutionary biologist, defines alternative medicine as a &quot;set of practices which cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dawkins&gt;{{cite book | last = Dawkins | first = Richard | author = Richard Dawkins | year = 2003 | title = A Devil's Chaplain | publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that &quot;there is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dawkins2&gt;{{cite book |title=A Devil's Chaplain |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2003 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=United States |isbn=978-0-618-33540-4 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials, it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/feb/15/scienceandnature.highereducation1 |title=Review: A Devil's Chaplain by Richard Dawkins |work=The Guardian |accessdate= 2010-04-23| location=London | date=2003-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in [[National Institutes of Health]] supported alternative medicine research.&lt;ref name=Cassileth_evaluating&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR |title=Evaluating complementary and alternative therapies for cancer patients |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=362–75 |year=1999 |pmid=11198952 |doi= 10.3322/canjclin.49.6.362|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a group of scientists made a proposal to shut down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]].  They argued that the vast majority of studies were based on unconventional understandings of physiology and disease and have shown little or no effect. Further, they argue that the field's more-plausible interventions such as diet, relaxation, yoga and botanical remedies can be studied just as well in other parts of NIH, where they would need to compete with conventional research projects.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html?hpid=sec-health |title=Scientists Speak Out Against Federal Funds for Research on Alternative Medicine|work=Washingtonpost |date=March 17, 2009 | first=David | last=Brown | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These concerns are supported by negative results in almost all studies conducted over ten years at a cost of $2.5 billion by the NCCAM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/ Research Results of Complementary and Alternative Medicine [NCCAM Research&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; R.

Wallace Sampson, an editor of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]] and a Stanford University  professor of medicine write that CAM is the &quot;propagation of the absurd&quot; based on the example that ''alternative'' and ''complementary'' have been substituted for ''quackery'', ''dubious'' and ''implausible'' and concerns that CAM tolerates contradiction without through reason and experiment.&lt;ref name=absurd&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sampson W, Atwood Iv K |title=Propagation of the absurd: demarcation of the absurd revisited |journal=Med.

==Classifications==
NCCAM has developed one of the most widely used classification systems for the branches of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;&lt;ref name =IOM2005/&gt;  It classifies complementary and alternative therapies into five major groups which have some overlap.&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;

# Whole medical systems: cut across more than one of the other groups; examples include [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], Naturopathy, [[Homeopathy]] and [[Ayurveda]].
# Mind-body medicine: takes a holistic approach to health that explores the interconnection between the mind, body, and spirit. It works under the premise that the mind can affect &quot;bodily functions and symptoms&quot;.
# Biologically based practices: use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances.
# Manipulative and body-based practices: feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in [[chiropractic]] and [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] manipulation.
# Energy medicine: is a domain that deals with putative and verifiable energy fields:
:* [[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the body. No empirical evidence has been found to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.
:* [[Bioelectromagnetism|Bioelectromagnetic]]-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current or direct-current fields in an unconventional manner.

Many people utilize mainstream medicine for [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and basic information, while turning to alternatives for therapy or health-enhancing measures. Studies indicate that alternative approaches are often used [[#Use of CAM as a complement to conventional medicine|''in conjunction with'']] conventional medicine.&lt;ref name=pmid15188733/&gt; This is referred to by NCCAM as [[Glossary of alternative medicine terms#Integrative medicine|integrative (or integrated) medicine]] because it &quot;combines treatments from conventional medicine and CAM for which there is some high-quality evidence of safety and effectiveness.&quot;&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt; According to [[Andrew Weil|Andrew T. Weil]] M.D., a leading proponent of integrative medicine, the principles of integrative medicine include: appropriate use of conventional and CAM methods; patient participation; promotion of health as well as treatment of disease; and a preference for natural, minimally-invasive methods.&lt;ref name='Weil'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/ART02054 |title=What is Integrative Medicine |accessdate = 2008-03-06 |last=Weil |first=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 survey found that 13.7% of respondents in the United States had sought the services of both a medical doctor and an alternative medicine practitioner. The same survey found that 96% of respondents who sought the services of an alternative medicine practitioner also sought the services of a medical doctor in the past 12 months. Medical doctors are often unaware of their patient's use of alternative medical treatments as only 38.5% of the patients alternative therapies were discussed with their medical doctor.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg_trends&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eisenberg DM, Davis RB, Ettner SL, ''et al.'' |title=Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: results of a follow-up national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=18 |pages=1569–75 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9820257 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]], Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, wrote in the Medical Journal of Australia that ''&quot;about half the general population in developed countries use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ernst&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=Obstacles to research in complementary and alternative medicine |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=179 |issue=6 |pages=279–80 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=12964907 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/179_06_150903/ern10442_fm-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey results released in May 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the United States [[National Institutes of Health]], found that in 2002 62.1% of adults in the country had used some form of CAM in the past 12 months and 75% across lifespan (though these figure drop to 36.0% and 50% if ''prayer specifically for health reasons'' is excluded); this study included yoga, meditation, herbal treatments and the [[Atkins diet]] as CAM.&lt;ref name=pmid15188733/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAM_reason&gt;[http://nccam.nih.gov/news/images/camreason_large.gif Reasons people use CAM.] [[NCCAM]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests a similar figure of 40%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Astin&quot;/&gt;

A British telephone survey by the BBC of 1209 adults in 1998 shows that around 20% of adults in Britain had used alternative medicine in the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas KJ, Nicholl JP, Coleman P |title=Use and expenditure on complementary medicine in England: a population based survey |journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11264963 |doi=10.1054/ctim.2000.0407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst has been active politically on this issue as well, publicly requesting that [[Prince Charles]] recall two guides to alternative medicine published by the Foundation for Integrated Health, on the grounds that &quot;[t]hey both contain numerous misleading and inaccurate claims concerning the supposed benefits of alternative medicine&quot; and that &quot;[t]he nation cannot be served by promoting ineffective and sometimes dangerous alternative treatments.&quot;&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;Mark Henderson, Science Editor, &quot;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article3760857.ece Prince of Wales's guide to alternative medicine 'inaccurate']&quot; ''Times Online'', April 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In general, he believes that CAM can and should be subjected to scientific testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=goodbadugly /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brit_gen_prac&quot;&gt;&quot;Complementary medicine is diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention which complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole, by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks of medicine.&quot;  Ernst et al. ''British General Practitioner'' 1995; 45:506.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of alternative medicine in developed countries appears to be increasing. A 1998 study showed that the use of alternative medicine had risen from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenberg_trends&quot;/&gt; In the United Kingdom, a 2000 report ordered by the [[House of Lords]] suggested that &quot;...limited data seem to support the idea that CAM use in the United Kingdom is high and is increasing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/123/12301.htm House of Lords report on CAM] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5EsdOV0Sd|date =2006-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[developing country|developing nations]], access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and [[poverty]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional remedies]], often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary health care or be integrated into the health care system.

Complementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients.  Complementary medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine.  &quot;From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kellehear, Complementary medicine: is it more acceptable in palliative care practice?

* When [[prayer]] specifically for health reasons is excluded, these figures fall to 49.8% and 36.0%, respectively.
* 45.2% had in the last twelve months used prayer for health reasons, either through praying for their own health or through others praying for them.
* 54.9% used CAM in conjunction with conventional medicine.
* 14.8% &quot;sought care from a licensed or certified&quot; practitioner, suggesting that &quot;most individuals who use CAM prefer to treat themselves.&quot;
* Most people used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain.
* &quot;Women were more likely than men to use CAM. The largest sex differential is seen in the use of [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Mind-body interventions|mind-body therapies]] including prayer specifically for health reasons&quot;.
* &quot;Except for the groups of therapies that included prayer specifically for health reasons, use of CAM increased as education levels increased&quot;.
* The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45.2%), [[herbalism]] (18.9%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing meditation]] (11.6%), [[meditation (alternative medicine)|meditation]] (7.6%), [[chiropractic medicine]] (7.5%), [[yoga (alternative medicine)|yoga]] (5.1%), [[body work (alternative medicine)|body work]] (5.0%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Diet-based therapy|diet-based therapy]] (3.5%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Progressive Relaxation|progressive relaxation]] (3.0%), [[Orthomolecular medicine|mega-vitamin therapy]] (2.8%) and [[Visualization (cam)|Visualization]] (2.1%)

In 2004, a survey of nearly 1,400 U.S. hospitals found that more than one in four offered alternative and complementary therapies such as acupuncture, homeopathy, and [[massage therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/20/health/webmd/main1823747.shtml Alternative Medicine Goes Mainstream] CBS News. Published July 20, 2006. Retrieved June 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 survey of US hospitals by Health Forum, a subsidiary of the [[American Hospital Association]], found that more than 37 percent of responding hospitals indicated they offer one or more alternative medicine therapies, up from 26.5 percent in 2005. Additionally, hospitals in the southern Atlantic states were most likely to include CAM, followed by east north central states and those in the middle Atlantic. More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aha.org/aha/press-release/2008/080915-pr-cam.html |title=Press Release : Latest Survey Shows More Hospitals Offering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Services |publisher=American Hospital Association |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Science Foundation]] has also conducted surveys of the popularity of alternative medicine. After describing the negative impact [[science fiction]] in the media has on public attitudes and understandings of [[pseudoscience]], and defining alternative medicine as all treatments that have not been proven effective using scientific methods, as well as mentioning the concerns of individual scientists, organizations, and members of the science policymaking community, it commented that &quot;nevertheless, the popularity of alternative medicine appears to be increasing.&quot;&lt;ref name=NSF_altmed&gt;[[National Science Foundation]] survey: [http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Public Understanding.

In the state of Texas, physicians may be partially protected from charges of unprofessional conduct or failure to practice medicine in an acceptable manner, and thus from disciplinary action, when they prescribe alternative medicine in a complementary manner, if board specific practice requirements are satisfied and the therapies utilized do not present &quot;a safety risk for the patient that is unreasonably greater than the conventional treatment for the patient's medical condition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tex.

=== Denmark ===
45.2 % of the Danish population aged 16 or above had in 2005 used alternative medicine at some point in life.
22.5 % had used alternative medicine within the previous year. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.vifab.dk/uk/statistics/alternative+medicine+in+denmark+2005 Alternative Medicine in Denmark 2005] www.vifab.dk/uk &lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular types of therapies within the previous year (2005) are:
* Massage, osteopathy or other manipulative techniques (13.2 percent)
* [[Reflexology]] (6.1 percent)
* [[Acupuncture]] (5.4 percent)

== Education ==
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}

In the United States, increasing numbers of medical colleges have started offering courses in alternative medicine. For example, in three separate research surveys that surveyed 729 schools (125 medical schools offering an MD degree, 25 medical schools offering a Doctor of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Osteopathic medicine]] degree, and 585 schools offering a nursing degree), 60% of the standard medical schools, 95% of osteopathic medical schools and 84.8% of the nursing schools teach some form of CAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wetzel MS, Eisenberg DM, Kaptchuk TJ |title=Courses involving complementary and alternative medicine at US medical schools |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=9 |pages=784–7 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9729989 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.9.784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saxon DW, Tunnicliff G, Brokaw JJ, Raess BU |title=Status of complementary and alternative medicine in the osteopathic medical school curriculum |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=121–6 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15083987 |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/content/full/104/3/121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenton MV, Morris DL |title=The integration of holistic nursing practices and complementary and alternative modalities into curricula of schools of nursing |journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=62–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12868254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Arizona]] College of Medicine offers a program in Integrative Medicine under the leadership of [[Andrew Weil]] that trains physicians in various branches of alternative medicine which &quot;...neither rejects conventional medicine, nor embraces alternative practices uncritically.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/about/definition.html University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; Accredited Naturopathic colleges and universities are also increasing in number and popularity in Canada and the USA. (See [[Naturopathic medical school in North America]]).

Similarly, &quot;unconventional medicine courses are widely represented at European universities. They cover a wide range of therapies. Many of them are used clinically. Research work is underway at several faculties,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barberis L, de Toni E, Schiavone M, Zicca A, Ghio R |title=Unconventional medicine teaching at the Universities of the European Union |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=337–43 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11558776 |doi=10.1089/10762800152709679}}&lt;/ref&gt; but &quot;only 40% of the responding [European] universities were offering some form of CAM training.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Varga O, Márton S, Molnár P |title=Status of complementary and alternative medicine in European medical schools |journal=Forschende Komplementärmedizin |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=41–5 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16582550 |doi=10.1159/000090216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to unconventional schools in Britain, no conventional medical schools offer courses that teach the clinical practice of alternative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zmark.net |url=http://www.healthy.net/scr/healingschools.asp |title=Alternative Medicine Schools &amp; Colleges - HealthWorld Online |publisher=Healthy.net |date= |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Medical Acupuncture Society]] offers medical acupuncture certificates to doctors, as does the [[College of Naturopathic Medicine UK and Ireland]].

== Regulation ==

'''Herbal medicine etc.'''

Due to the uncertain nature of various alternative therapies and the wide variety of claims different practitioners make, alternative medicine has been a source of vigorous debate, even over the definition of alternative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourfamilyshealth.com/alternative_medicine/first_do_no_harm/ Can Mainstream Medicine and Alternative Therapies Coexist?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2006.12.601 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. - The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine - 12(7):601]&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary supplements, their ingredients, safety, and claims, are a continual source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/alternative/9909/17/supplement.drug.journal/index.html | work=CNN | title=Nutritionist calls for tighter regulation of supplements | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, political issues, mainstream medicine and alternative medicine all collide, such as in cases where synthetic drugs are legal but the herbal sources of the same active chemical are banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/80582/ Former Surgeon General: Mainstream Medicine Has Endorsed Medical Marijuana | DrugReporter | AlterNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, controversy over mainstream medicine causes questions about the nature of a treatment, such as water fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84666.php Informed Public Debate Needed On Water Fluoridation]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative medicine and mainstream medicine debates can also spill over into freedom of religion discussions, such as the right to decline lifesaving treatment for one's children because of religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbmh.ca/index.php/cbmh/article/view/604/601 Book Review by Janice Dickin - Rennie B. Schoepflin; Christian Science on Trial: Religious Healing in America.]&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulators continue to attempt to find a regulatory balance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/art32168.html Dietary Supplement Regulation: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Public Hearing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jurisdiction]] differs concerning which branches of alternative medicine are legal, which are regulated, and which (if any) are provided by a government-controlled [[Publicly funded health care|health service]] or reimbursed by a [[health insurance|private health medical insurance company]].  The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - article 34 (''Specific legal obligations'') of the General Comment No. 14 (2000) on ''The right to the highest attainable standard of health'' - states that

: &quot;Furthermore, obligations to respect include a State's obligation to refrain from prohibiting or impeding traditional preventive care, healing practices and medicines, from marketing unsafe drugs and from applying coercive medical treatments, unless on an exceptional basis for the treatment of mental illness or the prevention and control of communicable diseases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Specific implementations of this article are left to member states.

A number of alternative medicine advocates disagree with the restrictions of government agencies that approve medical treatments. In the '''United States''', for example, critics say that the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]'s criteria for experimental evaluation methods impedes those seeking to bring useful and effective treatments and approaches to the public, and that their contributions and discoveries are unfairly dismissed, overlooked or suppressed. Alternative medicine providers recognize that [[health fraud]] occurs, and argue that it should be dealt with appropriately when it does, but that these restrictions should not extend to what they view as legitimate health care products.

In '''New Zealand''' alternative medicine products are classified as food products, so there are no regulations or safety standards in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/legislation/news/article.cfm?c_id=247&amp;objectid=10449883 David Schnauer: Therapeutics bill must pass - 06 July 2007 - Legislation news - NZ Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Australia''', the topic is termed as ''complementary medicine'' and the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] has issued various guidances and standards.&lt;ref name=rcm&gt;{{cite web

The production of modern pharmaceuticals is strictly regulated to ensure that medicines contain a standardized quantity of active ingredients and are free from contamination. Alternative medicine products are not subject to the same governmental quality control standards, and consistency between doses can vary. This leads to uncertainty in the chemical content and biological activity of individual doses. This lack of oversight means that alternative health products are vulnerable to adulteration and contamination.&lt;ref name='Agin'&gt;{{cite book | last = Agin | first = Dan | title = Junk Science: how politicians, corporations, and other hucksters betray us | publisher = Thomas Dunne Books | date = 2006-10-03 | pages = Ch. 8 | isbn = 978-0-312-35241-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is magnified by international commerce, since different countries have different types and degrees of regulation. This can make it difficult for consumers to properly evaluate the risks and qualities of given products.

== Alternative and evidence-based medicine ==
=== Testing of efficacy ===
{{anchor|Testing of efficacy}}
Many alternative therapies have been tested with varying results. In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Katz DL, Williams AL, Girard C, ''et al.'' |title=The evidence base for complementary and alternative medicine: methods of Evidence Mapping with application to CAM |journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=22–30 |year=2003 |pmid=12868249}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically. The book cites Vickers (1998), who found that many of the CAM-related RCTs are in the Cochrane register, but 19% of these trials were not in MEDLINE, and 84% were in conventional medical journals.&lt;ref name=IOM2005/&gt;{{rp|133}}

As of 2005 the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%) effect, 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.69% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the 2004 Cochrane database while the conventional review used the 1998 Cochrane database.&lt;ref name=IOM2005/&gt;{{rp|135-136}}

Lists of the Cochrane Reviews on alternative medicine including summaries of the results sorted by type of therapy (updated monthly) are made available at ViFABs (Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicines) home page, see the lists here: http://www.vifab.dk/uk/cochrane+and+alternative+medicine

Most alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able, which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. Additionally, in most countries alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy—also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.&lt;ref name=Ernst2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=The efficacy of herbal medicine--an overview |journal=Fundamental &amp; Clinical Pharmacology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=405–9 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16011726 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00335.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Horrobin DF | year = 1986 | title = Glittering prizes for research support | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 324 | issue = | page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCAM and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than $2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;$2.5 billion&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='nccam_$'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/about/budget/appropriations.htm |title=NCCAM Funding: Appropriations History |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=2008-01-09 |publisher=[[NCCAM]] | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5hSlSj9d5 | archivedate = 2009-06-11| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atwood2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Kimball C. | last=Atwood | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=The Ongoing Problem with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine | date=2003-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center | work =Skeptical Inquirer | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-18 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skeptics of alternative practices say that a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise ineffective therapy due to the [[placebo effect]], the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]), or the possibility that the person never originally had a true illness.&lt;ref&gt;James Alcock PhD, ''Alternative Medicine and the Psychology of Belief'', The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, Fall/Winter 1999 Volume 3 ~ Number 2. [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altpsych.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|12356597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers has stated:

: &quot;Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. In this article, clinical trial data on a number of alternative cancer cures including Livingston-Wheeler, Di Bella Multitherapy, antineoplastons, vitamin C, hydrazine sulfate, [[Laetrile]], and psychotherapy are reviewed. The label &quot;unproven&quot; is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been &quot;disproven.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=Vickers_disproven&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110 | author = Andrew Vickers PhD | year = 2004 | title = Alternative Cancer Cures: &quot;Unproven&quot; or &quot;Disproven&quot;? | url = http://caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/content/full/54/2/110 | journal = [[CA Cancer J Clin]] | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 110–118 | pmid=15061600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing of safety ===
{{See also|List of herbs with known adverse effects}}

==== Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals ====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR, Deng G |title=Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer |journal=The Oncologist |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=80–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14755017 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking &quot;natural&quot; potions to &quot;build up her strength&quot; before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.&lt;ref name='BenHills'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benhills.com/articles/articles/MED06a.html |title=Fake healers. Why Australia's $1 billion-a-year alternative medicine industry is ineffective and out of control. |accessdate = 2008-03-06 |last=Hills |first=Ben |work=Medical Mayhem }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

: &quot;''And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past''&quot;.&lt;ref name='ABC_Maclennan'&gt;{{cite news | first=Norman | last=Swan | coauthors= | title=Alternative Medicine - Part Three | date=2000-10-02 | publisher=ABC Radio National | url =http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s195441.htm | work =The Health Report | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential side-effects ====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments generally are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment—whether conventional or alternative — that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potentially dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, ''i.e.'' &quot;that which is natural cannot be harmful&quot;.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938 the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in &quot;several significantly different ways from other drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stehlin&gt;Isadora Stehlin. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071012070120/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/096_home.html Homeopathy: Real Medicine or Empty Promises?]&quot; - FDA Consumer magazine (December 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Homeopathic preparations, termed &quot;remedies,&quot; are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are thus considered safe on that count, but &quot;their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength,&quot; and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt;

==== Treatment delay ====

Those who have experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/354/7/731 |title=NEJM - Drug-Related Hepatotoxicity |doi=10.1056/NEJMra052270 |publisher=Content.nejm.org |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, &quot;unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments&quot; and refers to this as &quot;[[opportunity cost]]&quot;. Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.&lt;ref name='Lilienfeld_2002'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Our Raison d'Être|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice|year=2002|first=Scott O.|last=Lilienfeld|coauthors=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|id= |url=http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html|accessdate = 2008-01-28 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QcyAPtwV | archivedate = 2007-07-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary metabolites in thousands of plants are regularly tested by drug companies in search of new therapies. [[Atropa belladonna|Deadly nightshade]] contains atropine, a potent (and dangerous) substance useful in the treatment of a number of disorders, including as an antidote for nerve agents. Chemicals isolated from [[Foxglove]] are used in the treatment of epilepsy; [[Opiates]] derived from poppies are highly effective painkillers, and [[THC]], found in [[cannabis sativa]] is used to counter the effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy itself owes some of its constituent drugs to [[Chemotherapy#Plant alkaloids and terpenoids (L01C)|plant alkaloids]]. These name just a few of the most prominent classes of drugs derived from natural sources which have been adopted as treatments by alternative therapies.

In the US, many medical insurers and some hospitals integrate chiropractic and massage therapy as adjuncts to mainstream medical care.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==== Unconventional cancer &quot;cures&quot; ====

Perhaps because many forms of [[cancer]] are difficult or impossible to cure, there have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as &quot;unproven,&quot; suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown. However, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective.

== Integrative medicine, complementary medicine, fringe medicine ==

[[Integrative medicine]] is the combination of the practices and methods of alternative/complementary medicine with conventional medicine.&lt;ref name=What_Is_CAM&gt;[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/ What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?] [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. . Retrieved 20 February 2011. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5C1oRX8Qq|date =2005-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may include [[preventive medicine]] and [[patient centered medicine]]. It may also include practices not normally referred to as medicine, such as using [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[socializing]], and [[recreation]] as therapies. Its academic proponents sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments in order to achieve a placebo effect.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments. There was nevertheless evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain&quot;'', ''Acupuncture for Chronic Low Back Pain'', New England Journal of Medicine, 2010; 363:454-461, Brian M.

Criticism of integrative medicine includes about proposing to lie to patients about alternative medicines known to be no more than a placebo in order to achieve a [[placebo effect]], and “diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Credulityabout&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine, Science Based Medicine, Steven Novella [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391 Science-Based Medicine » Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Quackademic medicine]]&quot;, is a pejorative term used for “[[integrative medicine]]”, when considered to be an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science based medicine]], and was picked up by [[science based medicine]] anti ACM [[critics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Credulityabout&quot;/&gt;

===History===
Fueled by a nationwide survey published in 1993 by [[David Eisenberg]], which revealed that in 1990 approximately 60 million Americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, DM, et al. (1993). “Unconventional Medicine in the United States – Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use.” JAMA: 328:246-252.&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the November 11, 1998 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] reported that 42% of Americans had used complementary and alternative therapies, up from 34% in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg DM, Davis RB, Ettner SL, et al. 1998. Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990-1997: results of a follow-up national survey. JAMA. 1;280 (18):1569-75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine, most of the early alternative/complementary medical centers failed.&lt;ref name=bestpractices&gt;Best Practices in Integrative Medicine: A Report from the Bravewell Clinical Network. Published 2007. The Bravewell Collaborative. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal==

A study published in 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;Astin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Astin JA |title=Why patients use alternative medicine: results of a national study |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=19 |pages=1548–53 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9605899 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.19.1548}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments. Approximately 4.4 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine.  The research found that those who used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status.  Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was not a meaningful factor in the choice, but rather the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so largely because &quot;they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.&quot; In particular, subjects reported a holistic orientation to health, a transformational experience that changed their worldview, identification with a number of groups committed to environmentalism, feminism, psychology, and/or spirituality and personal growth, or that they were suffering from a variety of common and minor ailments - notably anxiety, back problems, and chronic pain.

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among that minority whose use them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine.  There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; Related to this are vigorous [[advertising|marketing]]&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weber DO |title=Complementary and alternative medicine. Considering the alternatives |journal=Physician Executive |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=6–14 |year=1998 |pmid=10351720}}&lt;/ref&gt; of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beyerstein BL|url=http://www.sram.org/0302/bias.html|title=Psychology and 'Alternative Medicine' Social and Judgmental Biases That Make Inert Treatments Seem to Work|journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|year=1999|volume=3|issue=2|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beyerstein2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beyerstein BL |title=Alternative medicine and common errors of reasoning |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=230–7 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11242572 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200103000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] towards conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein2/&gt; Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=pmid15188733/&gt; Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the [[placebo effect]], which is a well-established observation in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Deventer MO |title=Meta-placebo: do doctors have to lie about giving a fake treatment? |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18485613 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2008.03.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt;

Patients can also be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can potentially cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. More commonly, many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach.  In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beyerstein2/&gt;

Its popularity may be related to other factors. In an interview with [[Edzard Ernst]], ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote:

: &quot;Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. &quot;People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. &quot;At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Con?&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/features/complementary-therapies-the-big-con-813248.html |title=Complementary therapies: The big con? - The Independent |work= |accessdate= 2010-04-23| location=London | date=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Small rhombicosidodecahedron.png|thumb|The [[rhombicosidodecahedron]], one of the Archimedean solids]]
In [[geometry]] an '''Archimedean solid''' is  a highly symmetric, semi-regular [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] [[polyhedron]] composed of two or more types of [[regular polygon]]s meeting in identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. They are distinct from the [[Platonic solid]]s, which are composed of only one type of polygon meeting in identical vertices, and from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.

&quot;Identical vertices&quot; are usually taken to mean that for any two vertices, there must be an [[isometry]] of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other. Sometimes it is instead only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other. This difference in definitions controls whether the [[pseudorhombicuboctahedron]] is considered an Archimedean solid or a [[Johnson solid]].

[[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s, whose symmetry groups are the [[dihedral group]]s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, despite meeting the above definition. With this restriction, there are only finitely many Archimedean solids. They can all be made via [[Wythoff construction]]s from the [[Platonic solids]] with [[Tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] and [[icosahedral symmetry]].

==Origin of name==
The Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' and rediscovered all of these forms. This search was completed around 1620 by [[Johannes Kepler]],&lt;ref&gt;Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler,	''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', '''50''', 1997, 227&lt;/ref&gt; who defined [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprisms]], and the non-convex solids known as the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

==Classification==
There are 13 Archimedean solids (15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]], see below, are counted separately).

Here the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a [[vertex configuration]] of (4,6,8) means that a [[Square (geometry)|square]], [[hexagon]], and [[octagon]] meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).

Some definitions of [[semiregular polyhedron]] include one more figure, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] or &quot;pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Malkevitch|1988}}, p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

The number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex [[Defect (geometry)|angle defect]].

The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are edge-uniform and are called [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]].

The [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the Archimedean solids are called the [[Catalan solid]]s.  Together with the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the face-uniform solids with regular vertices.

=== Chirality ===

The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as [[chirality (mathematics)|''chiral'']], as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form. When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain [[chemical compound]]s).

In [[geometry]], an ''n''-sided '''antiprism''' is a [[polyhedron]] composed of two parallel copies of some particular ''n''-sided [[polygon]], connected by an alternating band of [[triangle]]s. Antiprisms are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.

Antiprisms are similar to [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.

In the case of a regular ''n''-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180°/n. Extra regularity is obtained by the line connecting the base centers being perpendicular to the base planes, making it a '''right antiprism'''.  As faces, it has the two [[n-gon|''n''-gonal]] bases and, connecting those bases, 2''n'' isosceles triangles.

== Uniform antiprism ==
A '''[[Prismatic uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism''' has, apart from the base faces, 2''n'' equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For ''n''=2 we have as degenerate case the regular [[tetrahedron]], and for ''n''=3 the non-degenerate regular [[octahedron]].

The [[dual polyhedron|dual polyhedra]] of the antiprisms are the [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]]. Their existence was first discussed and their name was coined by [[Johannes Kepler]].

== Cartesian coordinates ==
[[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a right antiprism with ''n''-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are
: &lt;math&gt;\left( \cos\frac{k\pi}{n}, \sin\frac{k\pi}{n}, (-1)^k h \right)&lt;/math&gt;
with ''k'' ranging from 0 to 2''n''-1; if the triangles are equilateral,
:&lt;math&gt;2h^2=\cos\frac{\pi}{n}-\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Volume and surface area ==
Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be the edge-length of a [[uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism. Then the volume is
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{n \sqrt{4\cos^2\frac{\pi}{2n}-1}\sin \frac{3\pi}{2n} }{12\sin^2\frac{\pi}{n}} \; a^3&lt;/math&gt;
and the surface area is
: &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{n}{2} ( \cot{\frac{\pi}{n}} + \sqrt{3}) a^2.&lt;/math&gt;

== Symmetry ==
The [[symmetry group]] of a right ''n''-sided antiprism with regular base and isosceles side faces is ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 4''n'',  except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger symmetry group '''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' of order 24, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group '''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' of order 48, which has four versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.

The symmetry group contains [[inversion in a point|inversion]] [[if and only if]] ''n'' is odd.

The [[rotation group]] is ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 2''n'',  except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group '''T''' of order 12, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger rotation group '''O''' of order 24, which has four versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.

The '''natural history of Africa''' encompasses some of the well known [[megafauna]] of that [[continent]].

[[Natural history]] is the study and description of organisms and natural objects, especially their origins, evolution, and interrelationships.

==Flora==
The vegetation of [[Africa]] follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture. The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical. In the countries bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], there are groves of [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[olive]] trees, evergreen [[oak]]s, [[cork oak|cork]] trees and [[pine]]s, intermixed with [[cupressus|cypresses]], [[Myrtus|myrtles]], [[arbutus]] and fragrant [[Erica|tree-heaths]].

South of the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas]] Range the conditions alter.  The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness.  Characteristic of the [[Sahara]] is the [[date palm]], which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the [[acacia]], from which gum arabic is obtained, is abundant.

The more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west African equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper [[Nile]]; and [[savanna]] interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. In the coast regions the typical tree is the [[mangrove]], which flourishes wherever the soil is of a [[swamp]] character.

The dense [[forest]]s of West Africa contain, in addition to a great variety of [[hardwood]]s, two [[Arecaceae|palms]], ''Elaeis guincensis'' ([[oil palm]]) and ''[[Raphia vinifera]]'' (bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. ''[[Bombax]]'' or silk-cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the India rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as [[odum]] (''Chlorophora excelsa''), [[ebony]], [[mahogany]] (''Khaya senegalensis''), [[Oldfieldia]] (''Oldfieldia africana'') and [[camwood]] (''Baphia nitida''). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or &quot;bush&quot; is extremely dense.

In the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or [[baobab]] (''Adanisonia digitata''), [[Hyphaene thebaica|doum palm]] (''Hyphaene'') and [[euphorbia]]s. The [[coffee]] plant grows wild in such widely separated places as [[Liberia]] and southern [[Ethiopia]]. The higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], the [[Himalaya]] and [[Indo-China]].

In the swamp regions of north-east Africa [[papyrus]] and associated plants, including the soft-wooded [[ambach]], flourish in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of [[kapsia]]s, [[mesembryanthemum]]s, [[aloe]]s and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the [[Podocarpus|Yellow-wood]] (''Podocarpus elongatus''), [[stinkwood]] (''Ocotea''), [[sneezewood]] or [[Cape ebony]] (''Pteroxylon utile'') and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.

==Fauna==
[[Image:P l Bleyenberghi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Southwest African lion (''Panthera leo bleyenberghi'').]]
The fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation.  The open savannas are the home of large [[ungulate]]s, especially [[antelope]]s, the [[giraffe]] (peculiar to Africa), [[zebra]], [[Cape buffalo|buffalo]], wild [[donkey]] and four species of [[rhinoceros]]; and of carnivores, such as the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[hyena]], etc. The [[okapi]] (a genus restricted to Africa) is found only in the dense forests of the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin. [[Bear]]s are confined to the Atlas region, [[wolf|wolves]] and [[fox]]es to North Africa. The [[elephant]] (though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the [[chimpanzee]] and [[gorilla]]. [[Baboon]]s and [[mandrill]]s, with few exceptions, are peculiar to Africa. The single-humped [[camel]], as a domestic animal, is
especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes.

The rivers in the tropical zone abound with [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]] and [[crocodile]]s, the former entirely confined to Africa. The vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior. [[Game reserve]]s have, however, been established in [[South Africa]], [[British Central Africa]], [[British East Africa]], [[Somaliland]], etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in May 1900.

The [[ornithology]] of northern Africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern Europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the Mediterranean. Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the [[ostrich]] and the [[secretary-bird]]. The ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the [[desert]] and [[steppe]] regions. The secretary-bird is common in the south.  The [[weaver bird]]s and their allies, including the [[long-tailed whydah]]s, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the [[francolin]] and [[guineafowl]]. Many of the smaller birds, such as the [[sunbird]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, the [[parrot]]s and [[kingfisher]]s, as well as the larger [[plantain-eater]]s, are noted for the brilliance of their plumage.

Of [[reptile]]s the [[lizard]] and [[chameleon]] are common, and there are a number of venomous [[snake]]s, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.

The [[scorpion]] is abundant. Of [[insect]]s Africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the [[locust]] is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the [[termite]]s are almost incredible. The spread of [[malaria]] by means of [[mosquito]]es is common. The [[tsetse fly]], whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of South and East Africa. It is found nowhere outside Africa.

'''[[Africa]]''' is a [[continent]] comprising 62 political territories, representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of [[Earth]]'s surface. It includes, within its remarkably regular outline, an area of {{convert|30368609|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}}, including adjacent islands.

Separated from [[Europe]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and from much of [[Asia]] by the [[Red Sea]], Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the [[Suez Canal]]), {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} wide. For [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] purposes, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]]&amp;nbsp;– east of the Suez Canal&amp;nbsp;– is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, [[Ras ben Sakka]] in [[Tunisia]], in 37°21′ N, to the most southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in [[South Africa]], 34°51′15″ S, is a distance approximately of {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}; from [[Cape Verde]], 17°33′22″ W, the westernmost point, to [[Ras Hafun]] in [[Somalia]], 51°27′52″ E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of {{convert|7400|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}. The length of coast-line is {{convert|26000|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is shown by the fact that Europe, which covers only {{convert|10400000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}}, has a coastline of {{convert|32000|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. [[Africa]] is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, and the southern from north to south.

==Plateau Region==
[[File:Topography of africa.png|thumb|Topography of Africa]]
The high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}, have a mean elevation of about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. The [[South African plateau]], as far as about 12° S, is bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts. On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer. Due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them. The largest of these level areas, the [[Great Karoo]], is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the [[Kalahari Desert]].

The South African plateau is connected towards [[East African plateau]], with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features. It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards
the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by [[Lake Nyasa]]), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.

Farther north the western depression, known as the [[Great Rift Valley]] is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] of [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]], [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], the first-named over 400 miles (600&amp;nbsp;km) long and the longest freshwater lake in the world. Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a meridional line east of the eastern trough. The eastern depression, known as the East African trough or rift-valley, contains much smaller lakes, many of them [[brackish water|brackish]] and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being [[Lake Turkana]] or Basso Norok.

At no great distance east of this rift-valley is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] - with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the latter being {{convert|5889|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}, and the culminating point of the whole continent&amp;nbsp;— and [[Mount Kenya]], which is {{convert|5184|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Hardly less important is the [[Ruwenzori Range]], over {{convert|5060|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}, which lies east of the western trough. Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active.

The third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}, while the summits reach heights of 4600 m to 4900 m (15,000 to 16,000&amp;nbsp;ft). This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by [[Lake Tsana]].

Both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower. The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of 1800 m to 2400 m (6000 to 8000&amp;nbsp;ft) are reached. Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south-west, has a height of {{convert|4075|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}, while Clarence Peak, in [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]], the first of the line of islands, rises to over {{convert|2700|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.

==Plains==
The area between the east and west coast highlands, which north of 17° N is mainly desert, is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground, one of which runs nearly centrally through North Africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole. The best marked of the basins so formed (the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin) occupies a circular area bisected by the equator, once probably the site of an inland sea.

Running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the [[Sahel]].

The arid region, the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]]&amp;nbsp;— the largest desert in the world, covering {{convert|9000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}}&amp;nbsp;— extends from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the Red Sea. Though generally of slight elevation it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to {{convert|2400|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} Bordered N.W. by the Atlas range, to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]; this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the Nile. That river (see below) pierces the desert without modifying its character. The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]], the north-westerly part of the continent, between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} broad. From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara. The greater part of that now desert region is, indeed, furrowed by old water-channels.

The following table gives the approximate altitudes of the chief mountains and lakes of the continent:

==Hydrology==
From the outer margin of the African plateaus, a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses, while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands, before breaking through the outer ranges. The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

To the main African rivers belong: Nile (the longest river of Africa), Congo (river with the highest water discharge on the continent) and the Niger, which flows half of its length through the arid areas. The largest lake are the following: Lake Victoria (Lake Ukerewe), Lake Chad, in the centre of the continent, Lake Tanganika laying between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania &amp; Zambia. There is also a considerably large lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of 1 of the poorest countries in the world -Malawi etc.. There are also numerous waterdams throughout the continent: Kariba on the river of Zambezi, Asuan in Egypt on the river of Nile and the biggest dam of the continent laying completely in The republic of Ghana is called Akosombo on the Volta river (Fobil 2003).
The high lake plateau of East Africa contains the headwaters of both the [[Nile]] and the [[Congo River|Congo]].

The upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighbourhood of the equator. From there, streams pour eastward into [[Lake Victoria]], the largest African lake (covering over 26,000 square m.), and to the west and north into [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert]]. To the latter of these, the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters. Issuing from there, the Nile flows northward, and between the latitudes of 7 and 10 degrees N. it traverses a vast marshy level, where its course is liable to being blocked by floating vegetation. After receiving the Bahr-el-Ghazal from the west and the [[Sobat River|Sobat]], [[Blue Nile]] and [[Atbarah River|Atbara]] from the Ethiopian highlands (the chief gathering ground of the flood-water), it separates the great desert with its fertile watershed, and enters the Mediterranean at a vast delta.

The most remote head-stream of the Congo is the [[Chambezi River|Chambezi]], which flows southwest into the marshy [[Lake Bangweulu]]. From this lake issues the Congo, known in its upper course by various names. Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through [[Lake Mweru]] and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa. Traversing this in a majestic northward curve, and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries, it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the Atlantic Ocean through the western highlands.

North of the Congo basin, and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface, is the basin of [[Lake Chad]] - a flat-shored, shallow lake filled principally by the [[Chari River|Chari]] coming from the southeast.

West of this is the basin of the [[Niger River|Niger]], the third major river of Africa. With its principal source in the far west, it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the Nile and Congo, and ultimately flows into the Atlantic&amp;nbsp;— a fact that eluded European geographers for many centuries. An important branch, however&amp;nbsp;— the [[Benue River|Benue]] - flows from the southeast.

These four river-basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of North and West Africa&amp;nbsp;— the remainder consisting of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea.

Of the remaining rivers of the Atlantic basin, the [[Orange River|Orange]], in the extreme south, brings the drainage from the [[Drakensberg]] on the opposite side of the continent, while the Kunene, Kwanza, Ogowe and Sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb; the [[Volta River|Volta]], Komoe, Bandama, [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Senegal River|Senegal]] the highlands of the western limb. North of the Senegal, for over 1000 miles (1600&amp;nbsp;km) of coast, the arid region reaches to the Atlantic. Farther north are the
streams, with comparatively short courses, reaching the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains.

Of the rivers flowing to the [[Indian Ocean]], the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the [[Zambezi]], whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. The main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ S 24°22′ E, at an elevation of {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}} It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward. All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of [[Lake Nyasa]], flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10 deg. to 12 deg. S. In the southwest, the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the [[Taukhe River|Taukhe]] (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water. The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in [[Lake Ngami]], now dried up.

Farther south, the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] drains a portion of the interior plateau, but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source. The [[Rovuma River|Rovuma]], [[Rufiji River|Rufiji]], [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]], [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Webi Shebeli River|Webi Shebeli]] principally drain the outer slopes of the East African highlands, the last of these losing itself in the sands in proximity to the sea. Another large stream, the [[Hawash river|Hawash]], rising in the Ethiopian mountains, is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden.

Lastly, between the basins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the East African plateau, directed chiefly into the lakes in the great rift valley. The largest river is the [[Omo river|Omo]], which, fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands, carries down a large body of water into [[Lake Rudolf]]. The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths, or by cataracts at no great distance upstream. But when these obstacles have been overcome, the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters.

The calculation of the areas of African drainage systems, made by Dr A. Bludau (Petermanns Mitteilungen, 43, 1897, pp.&amp;nbsp;184–186) yields the following general results:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! || mi² || Mm²
|-
| Basin of the Atlantic || 4,070,000 || 10.541
|-
| Basin of the Mediterranean || 1,680,000 || 4.351
|-
| Basin of the Indian Ocean || 2,086,000 || 5.403
|-
| Inland drainage area || 3,452,000 || 8.941
|}

The areas of individual river basins are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! || mi² || Mm²
|-
| Congo, length over 3000&amp;nbsp;mi (4800&amp;nbsp;km) || 1,425,000 || 3.691
|-
| Nile, length fully 4000&amp;nbsp;mi (6500&amp;nbsp;km) || 1,082,000 || 2.802
|-
| Niger, length about 2600&amp;nbsp;mi (4200&amp;nbsp;km) || 808,000 || 2.093
|-
| Zambezi, length about 2000&amp;nbsp;mi (3200&amp;nbsp;km) || 513,500 || 1.330
|-
| Lake Chad || 394,000 || 1.020
|-
| Orange, length about 1300&amp;nbsp;mi (2100&amp;nbsp;km) || 370,505 || 0.9596
|-
| Orange (actual drainage area) || 172,500 || 0.447 and 0.467

The area of the Congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the Amazon, while the African inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but Asia, where the corresponding area is 4,000,000 square miles (10 Mm²).

The principal African lakes have been mentioned in the description of the East African plateau, but some of the phenomena connected with them may be spoken of more particularly here. As a rule, the lakes found within the great rift-valleys have steep sides and are very deep. This is the case with the two largest of the type, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the latter with depths of 430 [[fathom]]s (790 m).

Others, however, are shallow, and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season. Such are [[Lake Rukwa]], in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa, and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the eastern rift-valley. Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth, the deepest sounding in [[Lake Victoria]] being under 50 fathoms (90 m).

Besides the East African lakes, the principal are: - [[Lake Chad]], in the northern inland watershed; [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu]] and [[Lake Mweru|Mweru]], traversed by the head-stream of the Congo; and [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]] and Ntomba (Mantumba), within the great bend of that river. All, except possibly Mweru, are more or less shallow, and Lake Chad appears to be drying up.

Divergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the East African lakes, especially [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea, dating from a time when the whole central Congo basin was under water; others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence. The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type. They include jellyfish, molluscs, prawns, crabs, etc.

==Islands==
With the exception of [[Madagascar]] the African islands are small. Madagascar, with an area of {{convert|229820|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, is, after [[Greenland]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Borneo]], the fourth largest island on the Earth. It lies in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the S.E. coast of the continent, from which it is separated by the deep [[Mozambique channel]], {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=off}} wide at its narrowest point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.zoom-maps.com/ Physical map of Africa] by National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; Madagascar in its general structure, as in flora and fauna, forms a connecting link between Africa and southern Asia. East of Madagascar are the small islands of [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]]. There are also islands in the Gulf of Guinea on which lies the Republic of Sao Tomé and Príncipe (islands of São Tomé and Príncipe). Part of the  Republic of Equatorial Guinea is laying on the island of Bioko (with the capital Malabo and the town of Lubu) and the island of Annobón. [[Socotra]] lies E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui. Off the north-west coast are the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Cape Verde]] archipelagoes. which, like some small islands in the Gulf of Guinea, are of volcanic origin.

Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the equator, Africa does not show excessive variations of temperature.

Great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of North Africa, removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean, and here, too, the contrast between day and night, and between summer and winter, is greatest. (The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.)

Farther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.

In the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.

The most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall. The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.
[[File:Africa FebAug.gif|thumb|width=220|left|Vegetation in February and August]]
The rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of [[Mount Cameroon]], where there is a mean annual rainfall of about {{convert|390|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} as compared with a mean of {{convert|458|in|mm||0|abbr=on}} at [[Cherrapunji]], in [[Meghalaya]], [[India]].

The two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once. Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.

The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in [[Egypt]] as the [[khamsin]], on the Mediterranean as the [[sirocco]], it is called on the Guinea coast the [[harmattan]]. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the [[Kalahari Desert]] in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.

{{Electoral systems}}

'''Approval voting''' is a [[Voting system#Single-winner methods|single-winner voting system]] used for [[election]]s. Each voter may vote for (or 'approve' of) as many of the candidates as the voter wishes.  The winner is the candidate receiving the most votes.  Each voter may vote for any combination of candidates and may give each candidate at most one vote.&lt;ref&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was described in 1976 by Guy Ottewell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalworkshop.com/ARVOfull.htm |title=Arithmetic of Voting (full text) |publisher=Universal Workshop |date= |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by [[Robert J. Weber]], who coined the term &quot;approval voting.&quot; It was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist [[Steven Brams]] and mathematician [[Peter Fishburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955105 | author = Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter | year = 1978 | title = Approval Voting | jstor =  1955105| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 831–847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

Approval voting can be considered a form of [[range voting]], with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1. Approval voting can also be compared to [[plurality voting system|plurality voting]], without the rule that discards ballots which vote for more than one candidate.

Ballots which mark every candidate the same (whether yes or no) have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot can therefore be viewed as a small &quot;delta&quot; which separates two groups of candidates, or a single-pair of ranks (e.g. if a ballot indicates that A &amp; C are approved and B &amp; D are not, the ballot can be considered to convey the ranking [A=C]&gt;[B=D]).

== Uses ==

Approval voting has been adopted by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/aboutmaa/bylaws03.html |title=MAA Bylaws |publisher=Maa.org |date=2007-08-05 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute of Management Sciences (1987) (now the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informs.org/downloadfile.php?i=a1d0c6e83f027327d8461063f4ac58a6 INFORMS bylaws], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Statistical Association]] (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/about/polproc/index.cfm?fuseaction=bylaws ASA Bylaws]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (1987).  According to Steven J. Brams and Peter C. Fishburn, the IEEE board in 2002 rescinded its decision to use approval voting. IEEE Executive Director Daniel J. Senese stated that approval voting was abandoned because &quot;few of our members were using it and it was felt that it was no longer needed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/brams/theory_to_practice.pdf |title=Going from Theory to Practice: The Mixed Success of Approval Voting |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approval voting also was used for Dartmouth Alumni Association elections for seats on the College Board of Trustees, but after some controversy&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedartmouth.com/2009/04/03/opinion/verbum VERBUM ULTIMUM Making Amends], April 2, 2009, ''Editorial, The Dartmouth''&lt;/ref&gt; it was replaced with traditional runoff elections by an alumni vote of 82% to 18% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/news.aspx?id=493 Dartmouth Alumni Association Election Results: New Executive Committee Elected; Constitutional Amendment Passes], May 9, 2009, ''Dartmouth Office of Alumni Relations''&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth students used approval voting to elect their student body president in 2011; the winner secured the support of 41% of voters against several write-in candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelittlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/hix-12-dartmouth-student-body-both.html Hix '12, Dartmouth Student Body, both shafted in student election], April 16, 2011, ''The Little Green Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;Historical_use&quot;&gt;Historically, several voting methods which incorporate aspects of approval voting have been used:&lt;/span&gt;
* Approving voting was used for [[papal conclave]]s between 1294 and 1621, with an average of about forty cardinals engaging in repeated rounds of voting until one candidate was listed on at least two-thirds of ballots.&lt;ref name=&quot;colomer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1162/002219598551616 | author = Josep M.

* In the 13th through 18th centuries, the [[Republic of Venice]] elected the [[Doge of Venice]] using a multi-stage process that featured random selection and voting which allowed approval of multiple candidates and required a supermajority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00135090 | author = Lines, Marji | year = 1986 | title = Approval Voting and Strategy Analysis: A Venetian Example | url =  | journal = Theory and Decision | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Mowbray, Dieter Gollmann (2007), {{PDFlink|[http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2007/HPL-2007-28R1.pdf Electing the Doge of Venice: analysis of a 13th Century protocol]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Steven J. Brams, approval voting was used in 19th century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/brams/normative_turn.pdf |title=The Normative Turn in Public Choice, p. 4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The selection of the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] has involved rounds of approval polling to help discover and build a consensus before a formal vote is held in the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.unsgselection.org/files/WisnumurtiGuidelinesSelectingCandidateSecretary-General.pdf The &quot;Wisnumurti Guidelines&quot; for Selecting a Candidate for Secretary-General]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on elections ==

Approval voting advocates [[Steven Brams]] and [[Dudley R. Herschbach]] predict that approval voting should increase voter participation, prevent minor-party candidates from being spoilers, and reduce negative campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Brams and Herschbach {{cite journal|title=The Science of Elections|doi=10.1126/science.292.5521.1449|journal=Science|volume=292|issue=5521|page=1449|year=2001|author=Brams, S. J.|pmid=11379606|last2=Herschbach|first2=DR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this system as an [[electoral reform]] measure is not without critics, however. [[FairVote]] has a position paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/index.php?page=1920 Why IRV]&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that approval voting has three flaws that undercut it as a method of voting and political vehicle. They argue that it can result in the defeat of a candidate who would win an absolute majority in a plurality system, can allow a candidate to win who might not win any support in a plurality elections, and has incentives for [[tactical voting]].
