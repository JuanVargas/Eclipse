e bar first appeared in 1921, as Babe Ruth's fame was on the rise and long after Cleveland had left the White House and 15 years after his daughter had died.  The company failed to negotiate an endorsement deal with Ruth, and many saw the company's story about the origin of the name of the bar as merely a ploy to avoid having to pay the baseball player any royalties. Ironically, Curtiss successfully shut down a rival bar that was approved by, and named for, Ruth, on the grounds that the names were too similar in the case of George H. Ruth Candy Co. v. Curtiss Candy Co, 49 F.2d 1033 (1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/names/babyruth.asp |title=Baby Ruth |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports marketing experts now believe that the Curtiss Candy Company employed the first successful use of an ambush sports marketing campaign, capitalizing on the Babe's name, fame, and popularity.

The ''New York Times'' supports the evidence of the ambush marketing campaign when it wrote &quot;For 85 years, Babe Ruth, the slugger, and Baby Ruth, the candy bar, have lived parallel lives in which it has been widely assumed that the latter was named for the former. The confection's creator, the Curtiss Candy Company, never admitted to what looks like an obvious connection – especially since Ruth hit 54 home runs the year before the first Baby Ruth was devoured. Had it done so, Curtiss would have had to compensate Ruth. Instead, it eventually insisted the inspiration was &quot;Baby Ruth&quot; Cleveland, the daughter of President Grover Cleveland. But it is an odd connection that makes one wonder at the marketing savvy of Otto Schnering, the company's founder.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/business/worldbusiness/06iht-web.0606ruth.1900800.html?_r=2 NYtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in 1995, a company representing the Ruth estate brought the Baby Ruth candy bar into sponsorship officialdom when it licensed the Babe's name and likeness for use in a Baby Ruth marketing campaign. On page 34 of the spring, 2007, edition of the [[Chicago Cubs]] game program, there is a full-page ad showing a partially-unwrapped Baby Ruth in front of the Wrigley ivy, with the caption, &quot;The official candy bar of Major League Baseball, and proud sponsor of the Chicago Cubs.&quot;  Continuing the baseball-oriented theme, during the summer and post-season of the 2007 season, a TV ad for the candy bar showed an entire stadium (played by [[Dodger Stadium]]) filled with people munching Baby Ruths, and thus having to hum rather than singing along with &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2006&quot;/&gt;

===Illness===
In 1946, he began experiencing severe pain over his left eye.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E7DC143FF93AA15751C1A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Doctor's World; Ruth's Other Record: Cancer Pioneer|publisher=New York Times|author=Lawrence K. Altman, M.D.|date=December 29, 1998|accessdate=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1946, a visit to French Hospital in New York revealed Ruth had a [[cancer|malignant tumor]] in his neck that had encircled his left [[carotid artery]]. He received post-operative radiation therapy. Before leaving the hospital in February 1947, he lost approximately {{convert|80|lbs|kg}}.

Around this time, developments in [[chemotherapy]] offered some hope. Teropterin, a [[folic acid]] derivative, was developed by Dr. Brian Hutchings of the Lederle Laboratories.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; It had been shown to cause significant remissions in children with [[leukemia]]. Ruth was administered this new drug in June 1947. He was suffering from headaches, hoarseness and had difficulty swallowing. He agreed to use this new medicine but did not want to know any details about it. All the while he was receiving this experimental medication, he did not know it was for cancer. On June 29, 1947, he began receiving injections and he responded with dramatic improvement. He gained over {{convert|20|lbs|kg}} and had resolution of his headaches. On September 6, 1947, his case was presented anonymously at the 4th Annual Internal cancer Research Congress in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Teropterin ended up being a precursor for [[methotrexate]], a now commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.

It is now known that Ruth suffered from [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]] (NPCA), a relatively rare tumor located in the back of the nose near the [[eustachian tube]]. Contemporary management for NPCA includes concurrent chemotherapy and [[radiation therapy]].

On April 27, 1947, the Yankees held a ceremony at Yankee Stadium. Despite his health problems, Ruth was able to attend &quot;Babe Ruth Day&quot;.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; Ruth spoke to a capacity crowd of more than 60,000, including many American Legion youth baseball players. Although lacking a specific memorable comment like Gehrig's &quot;Luckiest man&quot; speech, Ruth spoke from the heart, of his enthusiasm for the game of baseball and in support of the youth playing the game. (''&lt;span class=&quot;unicode audiolink&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.com/video.do?name=culture&amp;bcpid=1676043212&amp;bclid=1685979173&amp;bctid=1628332710 Babe Ruth speaking at Yankee Stadium]&lt;/span&gt;'')

Later, Ruth started the Babe Ruth Foundation, a charity for disadvantaged children. Another Babe Ruth Day held at Yankee Stadium in September 1947 helped to raise money for this charity.

After the cancer returned, Ruth attended the 25th anniversary celebration of the opening of Yankee Stadium on June 13, 1948. He was reunited with old teammates from the 1923 Yankee team and posed for photographs. The photo of Ruth taken from behind, using a bat as a cane, standing apart from the other players, and facing &quot;Ruthville&quot; (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs. It won the Pulitzer Prize.

=== Death ===
[[File:Babe Ruth 800.jpg|thumb|left|The grave of Babe Ruth]]

Shortly after he attended the Yankee Stadium anniversary event, Ruth was back in the hospital. He received hundreds of well-wishing letters and messages. This included a phone call from President [[Harry Truman]]. Claire helped him respond to the letters.

On July 26, 1948, Ruth attended the premiere of the film ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]'', a biopic about his own life. [[William Bendix]] portrayed Ruth. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually became worse, and in his last days, scores of reporters and photographers hovered around the hospital. Only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was [[National League]] president and future [[Commissioner of Baseball]], [[Ford Frick]]. &quot;Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard,&quot; Frick said years later.

On August 16, the day after Frick's visit, Babe Ruth died at age 53 due to [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; An [[autopsy]] showed the cancer Ruth died from began in the nose and mouth and spread widely throughout his body from there.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; His body lay [[Lying in repose|in repose]] in Yankee Stadium. His funeral was two days later at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]]. Ruth was then buried in the [[Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven]] in [[Hawthorne, New York]].
At his death, the New York ''Times'' called Babe Ruth, &quot;a figure unprecedented in American life. A born showman off the field and a marvelous performer on it, he had an amazing flair for doing the spectacular at the most dramatic moment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Babe Ruth, Baseball's Great Star and Idol of Children, Had a Career Both Dramatic and Bizarre |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0206.html |quote=Probably nowhere in all the imaginative field of fiction could one find a career more dramatic and bizarre than that portrayed in real life by George Herman Ruth.

He was also its greatest drawing-card, its highest salaried performer—at least of his day—and the idol of millions of youngsters throughout the land. |publisher=New York Times |date=August 17, 1948 |accessdate=July 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth's impact on American culture still commands attention. Top performers in other sports are often referred to as &quot;The Babe Ruth of ______.&quot;&lt;ref name=sportscentury/&gt; He is widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Rating the Top Baseball Players of All Time | url=http://baseballguru.com/egartman/analysisericgartman01.html | accessdate = November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many polls place him as the number one player of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Top Ten Baseball Players of All Time | url=http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/bob260505/2006/05/31/Top_Ten_Baseball_players_of_all_time | accessdate = November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth was mentioned in the poem ''&quot;[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]&quot;'' by [[Ogden Nash]]:

{{Quote box |width= 18em |border= 4px |align= center |bgcolor= #FAF0E6 |qalign= center | title=''Line-Up for Yesterday''|quote=''R is for Ruth.''&lt;br/&gt;''To tell you the truth,''&lt;br/&gt;''There's just no more to be said,''&lt;br/&gt;''Just R is for Ruth.''
|source= — ''[[Ogden Nash]]'', [[Sport magazine|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Films have been made featuring Ruth, or a Ruth-like figure (&quot;The Whammer&quot; in ''[[The Natural]]'', for example).

During [[World War II]], Japanese soldiers would yell in English, &quot;To hell with Babe Ruth&quot;, in order to anger American soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  An episode of [[Hawaii Five-O]] would be named &quot;To Hell With Babe Ruth&quot; because of that.&lt;ref name=sportscentury/&gt;

As a sidelight to his prominent role in changing the game to the power game, the frequency and popularity of Ruth's home runs eventually led to a rule change pertaining to those hit in sudden-death mode (bottom of the ninth or later inning). Prior to 1931, as soon as the first necessary run to win the game scored, the play was over, and the batter was credited only with the number of bases needed to drive in the winning run. Thus, if the score was 3–2 with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth, and the batter smacked an &quot;over the fence home run&quot;, the game would end at 4–3, with the batter only allowed a double, and the runners officially stopped on 2nd and 3rd (since they weren't needed to win the game). The new rule allowed the entire play to complete, justified on the grounds that the ball was dead and that all runners could freely advance, thus granting the full allotment of HR and RBI to the batter, as we know it today. Several players lost home runs that way, including Ruth. As noted in the inaugural edition of ''The Baseball Encyclopedia'' (MacMillan, 1969), Ruth's career total would have been changed to 715 if historians during the 1960s had been successful in pursuing this matter. Major League Baseball elected not to retrofit the records to the modern rules, and Ruth's total stayed at 714.

Another rules change that affected Ruth was the method used by umpires to judge potential home runs when the batted ball left the field near a foul pole. Before 1931, i.e. through most of Ruth's most productive years, the umpire called the play based on the ball's final resting place &quot;when last seen&quot;. Thus, if a ball went over the fence fair, and curved behind the foul pole, it was ruled foul. Beginning in 1931 and continuing to the present day, the rule was changed to require the umpire to judge based on the point where the ball cleared the fence. Jenkinson's book (p.&amp;nbsp;374–375) lists 78 foul balls near the foul pole in Ruth's career, claiming that at least 50 of them were likely to have been home runs under the modern rule.

Ruth's 1919 contract that sent him from Boston to New York was sold at auction for $996,000 at [[Sotheby's]] on June 10, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-06-10-ruth-contract_x.htm|title=Babe Ruth contract sells after 15 minutes of intense bidding|work=USA Today|author=Larry McShane|date=June 10, 2005|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most valuable [[memorabilia]] item relating to Ruth was his 1923 bat which he used to hit the first home run at Yankee Stadium on April 18, 1923. Ruth's heavy [[Louisville Slugger]] solid [[ash tree|ash]] wood bat sold for $1.26&amp;nbsp;million at a Sotheby's auction in December 2004, making it the third most valuable baseball memorabilia item, behind [[Mark McGwire]]'s 70th home run ball and the famous 1909 [[T206 Honus Wagner|Honus Wagner baseball card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/us_sport/4064243.stm|title=Babe Ruth bat sold for over $1m|work=BBC Sport|date=December 2, 2004|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barge on River Thames, London - Dec 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Barges towed by a tugboat on the [[River Thames]] in London]]
A '''barge''' is a flat-bottomed [[boat]], built mainly for [[river]] and [[canal]] transport of heavy goods. Some barges are not self-propelled and need to be towed by [[tugboat]]s or pushed by [[towboats]]. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent [[towpath]], contended with the [[railway]] in the early [[industrial revolution]], but [[history of the British canal system|were outcompeted]] in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of [[Rail transport|rail]].

==Modern use==
[[Image:Chicago River towboat and barge 080405.jpg|thumb|right|A towboat pushing a barge on the [[Chicago River]]]]
Barges are used today for low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods by barge is very low.  Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical barge measures 195 by 35 feet (59.4&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;× 10.6&amp;nbsp;m), and can carry up to 1,500 tons&lt;!-- which long, metric or short? --&gt; of cargo.  As an example, on June 26, 2006, a 565-ton&lt;!-- which long, metric or short? --&gt; [[Cracking (chemistry)|catalytic cracking]] unit reactor was shipped by barge from the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]] in [[Oklahoma]] to a refinery in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]].  Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled onsite, but shipping an assembled unit reduced costs and avoided reliance on construction labor at the delivery site (which in this case was still recovering from [[Hurricane Katrina]]).  Of the reactor's {{convert|700|mi|adj=on}} journey, only about 40&amp;nbsp;miles were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.

Self-propelled barges may be used as such when traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters.  Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.

Many barges, primarily [[Dutch barge|Dutch Barges]], which were originally designed for carrying cargo along the canals of Europe, are no longer large enough to compete in this industry with larger newer vessels. Many of these barges have been renovated and are now used as luxury [[Hotel barge|Hotel Barges]] carrying holiday makers along the same canals they once carried grain or coal.

==Towed or otherwise unpowered barges in the USA==
In primitive regions today and in all pre-development (lacking highways or railways) regions worldwide in times before industrial development and highways, barges were the predominant and most efficient means of inland transportation in many regions of the world. This holds true even today, for many areas of the world. In such pre-industrialized, or poorly developed infrastructure regions, many barges are purpose-designed to be powered on waterways by long slender poles{{mdash}}thereby becoming known on American waterways as '''poleboats''' as the extensive west of North America was settled using the vast tributary river systems of the [[Mississippi]] [[drainage basin]]. Poleboats utilize muscle power of &quot;walkers&quot; along the sides of the craft pushing against a pole against the streambed, canal, or lake bottom to move the vessel where desired. In settling the American west it was generally faster to navigate down River from [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], to the [[Ohio River]] confluence with the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and then pole up river against the current to St Louis than to travel overland on the rare primitive dirt roads for many decades after the [[American revolution]].

Once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads reached Chicago, that time dynamic changed, and American poleboats became less common, relegated to smaller rivers and more remote streams. On that Mississippi riverine system today, including that of other sheltered waterways, industrial barge trafficking in bulk raw materials such as coal, coke, timber, iron ore and other minerals is extremely common in the developed world using huge '''cargo barges''' that connect in groups and trains-of-barges in ways which allow cargo volumes and weights which would astonish pioneers of modern barge systems and methods in the [[Victorian era]].
[[Image:The tugboat, Herbert P. Brake.jpg|thumb|The [[towboat]], Herbert P. Brake, of New York, pushes a new barge East on the Erie Canal in Fairport, NY]]

Such barges are not self-propelled and need to be towed by [[tugboat]]s or pushed by [[towboats]]. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent [[towpath]] were of fundamental importance in the early industrial revolution, whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build [[viaduct]]s, [[aqueduct]]s and especially [[canal]]s to fuel and feed the raw materials to the nascent factories being born in the early industrial takeoff, and take their goods to the ports and cities for distribution.

The barge and canal system contended favorably with the [[railway]]s in the early [[industrial revolution]] prior to around the [[1850s]]&amp;nbsp;– [[1860s|60s]]{{mdash}}for example, the [[Erie Canal]] in [[New York]] State is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for [[New York City]] to eclipse [[Philadelphia]] as America's largest port and city{{mdash}} but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues [[history of the British canal system|were eventually outcompeted]] in the carriage of high-value items by the railways  due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of [[Rail transport]]. Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after World War I in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the [[Low Countries]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and especially [[Great Britain]] which more or less made the system characteristically its own.

On the [[Canals of Great Britain|Great British canal system]], the term 'barge' is used to describe a boat wider than a [[narrowboat]], and the people who move barges are often known as [[lightermen]]. In the United States, deckhands perform the labor and are supervised by a leadman or the mate. The captain and pilot steer the towboat, which pushes one or more barges held together with rigging, collectively called 'the tow'. The crew live aboard the towboat as it travels along the inland river system or the intracoastal waterways. These towboats travel between ports and are also called line-haul boats.

Poles are used on barges to fend off the barge as it nears other vessels or a wharf. These are often called 'pike poles'. On shallow canals in the United Kingdom, long [[punt (boat)|punt poles]] are used to manoeuvre or propel the barge.

==Etymology==
[[Image:PénicheRecyclageFerrailles2008Deûle2.jpg|thumb|right|A barge carrying recycling material on Deûle channel in [[Lambersart]], France]]
''Barge'' is attested from 1300, from [[Old French]] ''barge'', from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''barga''. The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. ''[[barque|Bark]]'' &quot;small ship&quot; is attested from 1420, from Old French ''barque'', from Vulgar Latin ''barca'' (400 AD). The more precise meaning &quot;three-masted ship&quot; arose in the 17th century, and often takes the French spelling for disambiguation. Both are probably derived from the [[Latin]] ''barica'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''baris'' &quot;Egyptian boat&quot;, from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''bari'' &quot;small boat&quot;, [[hieroglyphic]] Egyptian &lt;small&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;D58-G29-M17-M17-D21-P1&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/small&gt; and similar ''ba-y-r'' for &quot;basket-shaped boat&quot;. [http://books.google.com/books?id=8cMWickoS6oC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=egyptian+word+for+boat+Bairi+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=HyFttihvZr&amp;sig=x11WDJZ-M-mACFmJCF-KKanlHvg&amp;hl=en] By extension, the term &quot;embark&quot; literally means to board the kind of boat called a &quot;barque&quot;.

The long poles used to maneuver or propel a barge have given rise to the saying &quot;I wouldn't touch that [subject/thing] with a barge pole.&quot; This is a variation on the phrase &quot;I wouldn't touch that with a [insert length] pole.&quot;  It appears that the association with barge poles came after the phrase was in use. Modern usage uses a 'ten-foot' pole, but the earliest instances in print involve a forty-foot pole [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ten], which is improbably long for operating a barge.

{{American and British English differences}}

'''British English''', or '''UK English''' ('''BrE''', '''BE''', '''en-GB'''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-GB&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''British English'' , as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt;), is the broad term used to distinguish the forms of the [[English language]] used in the [[United Kingdom]] from forms used elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' applies the term to English &quot;as spoken or written in the British Isles; esp[ecially] the forms of English usual in Great Britain...&quot;, reserving &quot;[[Hiberno-English]]&quot; for &quot;The English language as spoken and written in Ireland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=British English; Hiberno-English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are slight regional variations in formal written English in the [[United Kingdom]], for example, although the words ''[[wiktionary:wee|wee]]'' and ''little'' are interchangeable in some contexts, one is more likely to see ''wee'' written by someone from northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] (and especially Scotland) or from [[Northern Ireland]] than by someone from [[Southern England]] or [[Wales]]. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in ''written'' English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described as &quot;British English&quot;. The forms of ''spoken'' English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jeffries, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/27/regional-english-dialects The G2 guide to regional English], [[The Guardian]], 27 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and a uniform concept of &quot;British English&quot; is therefore more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the ''Oxford Guide to World English'' (p.&amp;nbsp;45), &quot;[f]or many people...especially in England [the phrase ''British English''] is [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautologous]],&quot; and it shares &quot;all the ambiguities and tensions in the word ''British'', and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity&quot;.

== History ==
{{Main|History of English}}

[[English language|English]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought to Britain by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic settlers]] from various parts of what is now northwest [[Germany]] and the northern [[Netherlands]]. The resident population at this time was generally speaking [[British language|Brythonic]] - the insular variety of [[continental Celtic]] which was influenced by occupation by the [[Roman army|Romans]]. This group of languages ( [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric]]) cohabited alongside [[English language|English]] into the modern period, but due to their remoteness from the [[Germanic languages]], influence on English was [[Lists of English words of Celtic origin|notably limited]]. However the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued&lt;ref&gt;[[English and Welsh]], 1955 J R R Tolkien, also see references in [[Brittonicisms in English]]&lt;/ref&gt; that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] Kingdoms of England. One of these dialects, [[Late West Saxon]], eventually came to dominate. The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two waves of invasion; the first was by language speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family; they conquered and colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries. The second was the [[Normans]] in the 11th century, who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed an English variety of this called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. These two invasions caused English to become &quot;mixed&quot; to some degree (though it was never a truly [[mixed language]] in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).

Cohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in a significant grammatical simplification and lexical enrichment of the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] core of English; the later Norman occupation led to the grafting onto that Germanic core of a more elaborate layer of words from the Romance branch of the European languages. This Norman influence entered English largely through the courts and government. Thus, English developed into a [[loanword|&quot;borrowing&quot; language]] of great flexibility and with a huge [[vocabulary]].

== Dialects ==
[[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|Dialects]] and [[Regional accents of English speakers|accents]] vary amongst the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], as well as within the countries themselves. There are also differences in the English spoken by different socio-economic groups in any particular region.

The major divisions are normally classified as [[English English]] (or English as spoken in England, which comprises [[Southern English English|Southern English]] dialects, [[Midlands English]] dialects and [[Northern English]] dialects), [[Welsh English]] (not to be confused with the [[Welsh language]]), and [[Scottish English]] (not to be confused with the [[Scots language]]). The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages. The Scottish and Northern English dialects include many words originally borrowed from [[Old Norse]] and a few borrowed from [[Scots Gaelic language|Gaelic]], though most of the structure and common words are conservative Anglo-Saxon, hence 'kirk' (church), 'beck' (stream), 'feart' (feared), 'fell' (hillside), 'kistie' (chest, box), 'lang syne' (long ago) and so on.

Following its last major [[survey of English Dialects]] (1949–1950), the [[University of Leeds]] has started work on a new project. In May 2007 the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] awarded a grant to a team led by Sally Johnson, Professor of Linguistics and Phonetics at Leeds University, to study British regional dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~smlsaj/ Professor Sally Johnson] biography on the [[Leeds University]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEO&gt;[http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/press_releases/current/voices.htm Mapping the English language – from cockney to Orkney], [[Leeds University]] website, 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's team are{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} sifting through a large collection of examples of regional slang words and phrases turned up by the &quot;Voices project&quot; run by the [[BBC]], in which they invited the public to send in examples of English still spoken throughout the country. The BBC Voices project also collected hundreds of news articles about how the British speak English from swearing through to items on language schools. This information will also be collated and analysed by Johnson's team both for content and for where it was reported. &quot;Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the Voices study is that the English language is as diverse as ever, despite our increased mobility and constant exposure to other accents and dialects through TV and radio.&quot;&lt;ref name=MEO/&gt; Work by the team on this project is not expected to end before 2010. When covering the award of the grant on 1 June 2007, [[The Independent]] stated:
{{quote|Mr Upton, who is Professor of English at [[Leeds University]], said that they were &quot;very pleased&quot;{{ndash}} and indeed, &quot;well chuffed&quot;{{ndash}} at receiving their generous grant. He could, of course, have been &quot;bostin&quot; if he had come from the [[Black Country]], or if he was a [[Scouser]] he would have been well &quot;made up&quot; over so many spondoolicks, because as a [[Geordie]] might say, £460,000 is a &quot;canny load of chink&quot;&lt;ref name=Indi-20070601&gt;McSmith, Andy.

Page 20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Regional===
The form of English most commonly associated with the [[upper class]] in the southern counties of England is called [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP).&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;{{cite article |last=Fowler |first=H.W. |editor=R.W. Birchfield |title=Fowler's Modern English Usage |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from a mixture of the Midland and Southern dialects which were spoken in London in the early modern period&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; and is frequently used as a model for teaching English to foreign learners.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; Although speakers from elsewhere in England may not speak with an RP accent it is now a class-dialect more than a local dialect. It may also be referred to as &quot;the Queen's (or King's) English&quot;, &quot;[[Independent School (UK)|Public School]] English&quot;, or &quot;[[BBC]] English&quot; as this was originally the form of English used on radio and television, although a wider variety of accents can be heard these days. About two percent of Britons speak RP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/ Learning: Language &amp; Literature: Sounds Familiar?: Case studies: Received Pronunciation] [[British Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has evolved quite markedly over the last 40 years.

In the South East there are significantly different accents; the London [[Cockney]] accent is strikingly different from RP and its [[rhyming slang]] can be (and was initially intended to be) difficult for outsiders to understand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklyn1975&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklyn|first=Julian|title=A dictionary of rhyming slang|year=1975|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-415-04602-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the South Eastern county of Surrey, where RP is prevalent, closer to London it approaches Cockney, further south it becomes more rural, and this continues through Sussex and Hampshire where the accents and language are even more rustic. In fact the accents and dialect of the south coast can range from the classic South Eastern RP through rustic and gradually to a West Country accent as one passes through Kent, Sussex, Hampshire, Dorset, Devon and finally into [[Cornwall]], where the Celtic language of [[Cornish language|Cornish]] is also spoken by some people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Cornish language had a considerable influence on the traditional Cornish accent and dialect, which is still evident today among older Cornish people, for example saying &quot;I do go&quot; for &quot;I go&quot;.

[[Estuary English]] has been gaining prominence in recent decades: it has some features of RP and some of Cockney. In London itself, the broad local accent is still changing, partly influenced by Caribbean speech. Communities migrating to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's school children. As a result, [[London]]ers speak with a mixture of accents, depending on ethnicity, neighbourhood, class, age, upbringing, and sundry other factors, and [[Multicultural London English]] has emerged as a mixture of these influences. 

Since the mass [[immigration]] to [[Northamptonshire]] in the 1940s and its close accent borders, it has become a source of various accent developments. There, nowadays, one finds an accent known locally as the [[Kettering]] accent, which is a mixture of many different local accents, including [[East Midlands]], [[East Anglia]]n, [[Scottish English|Scottish]], and [[Cockney]]. In addition, in the town of [[Corby]], five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely based on Scottish. This is due to the influx of Scottish steelworkers.

Outside the South East there are, in England alone, other families of accents easily distinguished by natives, including:
*[[West Country]] ([[South West England]])
*[[East Anglia]]n
*[[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] ([[Black Country]], [[Birmingham]])
*[[East Midlands]]
*[[Liverpool]] and [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] ([[Scouse]])
*[[Manchester]] ([[Manchester dialect|Mancunian]]) and other east [[Lancashire]] accents
*[[Yorkshire]] (Varies significantly in each region.)
*[[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] ([[Geordie]]) and other northeast England accents

Major differences in Scottish accents include:

*[[Glasgow]] and [[Strathclyde]] ([[Glaswegian]]/West Scotland Accent)
*[[Edinburgh]] and [[Lothian]] (East Scotland Accent)
*[[Aberdeen]] and [[Grampian]] (Aberdonian/North East Accent)
*[[Dundee]] and [[Fife]]
*[[Inverness]] and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]
*[[Western Isles]]

Although some of the stronger regional accents may sometimes be difficult for some anglophones from outside Britain to understand, almost all &quot;British English&quot; accents are [[mutually intelligible]] amongst the British themselves, with only occasional difficulty between very diverse accents. However, modern communications and mass media{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} have reduced these differences significantly. Some portions of a small number of British films released in America have been dubbed to make viewing of the film more enjoyable for those Americans who are unfamiliar with certain British dialects. (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' in the [[Barnsley]] dialect, ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' in the Edinburgh dialect).

In addition, most British people can to some degree temporarily 'swing' their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners. This phenomenon is known in [[linguistics]] as ''[[Code-switching|code shifting]]''.

== Standardisation ==
As with English around the world, the English language as used in the United Kingdom and the [[Republic of Ireland]] is governed by convention rather than formal code: there is no equivalent body to the [[Académie française]] or the [[Real Academia Española]], and the authoritative dictionaries (for example, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''[[LDOCE|Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'', ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]'', ''[[Collins Dictionary]]'') record usage rather than prescribe it. In addition, vocabulary and usage change with time; words are freely borrowed from other languages and other strains of English, and [[neologism]]s are frequent.

For historical reasons dating back to the rise of [[London]] in the 9th century, the form of language spoken in London and the [[East Midlands]] became standard English within the Court, and ultimately became the basis for generally accepted use in the law, government, literature and education within Britain. Largely, modern British spelling was standardised in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), although previous writers had also played a significant role in this and much has changed since 1755. Scotland, which underwent [[Acts of Union 1707|parliamentary union]] with England only in 1707, still has a few independent aspects of standardisation, especially within its autonomous legal system.

Since the early 20th century, numerous books by British authors intended as guides to English grammar and usage have been published, a few of which have achieved sufficient acclaim to have remained in print for long periods and to have been reissued in new editions after some decades. These include, most notably of all, Fowler's [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|''Modern English Usage'']] and [[The Complete Plain Words]] by [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]]. Detailed guidance on many aspects of writing British English for publication is included in style guides issued by various publishers including [[The Times]] newspaper, the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[Cambridge University Press]], and others. The Oxford University Press guidelines were originally drafted as a single broadsheet page by [[Horace Hart|Horace Henry Hart]] and were, at the time (1893) the first guide of their type in English; they were gradually expanded and eventually published, first as [[Hart's Rules]] and, most recently (in 2002), as part of ''The Oxford Manual of Style''. Comparable in authority and stature to [[The Chicago Manual of Style]] for published American English, the Oxford Manual is a fairly exhaustive standard for published British English, to which writers can turn in the absence of any specific document issued by the publishing house that will publish their work.

== Glottal stop replacing T ==
In informal British English it is common for the sound /t/, except at the beginning of words, to be replaced by a [[glottal stop]]. Once regarded as a Cockney feature, it has become much more widespread. It is still stigmatised when used in words like 'water', but very widespread at the end of words such as 'that' (as in &quot;I like that&quot;). The use between vowels contrasts with American English where a flapped 't' can sound like 'd' to British speakers.

{{About||the surname Battle|Battle (surname)|other uses|Battle (disambiguation)}}
Generally, a '''battle''' is a conceptual component in the hierarchy of [[combat]] in [[war]]fare between two or more [[Military|armed force]]s, or combatants. In a battle, each combatant will seek to defeat the others, with defeat determined by the conditions of a [[military campaign]]. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area and force commitment.&lt;ref&gt;p.65, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wars and military campaigns are guided by [[military strategy|strategy]], whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as [[operational mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;p.10, Glantz&lt;/ref&gt; German strategist [[Carl von Clausewitz]] stated that &quot;the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war&quot;&lt;ref&gt;translation of part quote from p.77, Clausewitz&lt;/ref&gt; was the essence of [[strategy]].

[[Image:Sadler, Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''The [[Battle of Waterloo]]'' by [[William Sadler (painter)|William Sadler II]]]]

== Etymology ==
The definition of a battle cannot be arrived at solely through the names of historical battles, many of which are [[misnomer]]s. The word ''battle'' is a [[loanword]] in English from the [[Old French]] ''bataille'', first attested in 1297, and is itself a borrowing from [[Late Latin]] ''battualia'', meaning &quot;exercise of soldiers and gladiators in fighting and fencing,&quot; from [[Latin]] ''battuere'' &quot;beat&quot;, from which the English word ''battery'' is also derived via [[Middle English]] ''batri'',&lt;ref&gt;p.33, Tucker&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from the staged battles in the [[Colosseum#Use|Colosseum]] in Rome that may have numbered 10,000 individuals. A battle refers to an epic fight.

== Characteristics of battle ==
{{history of war}}
The defining characteristic of the battle as a concept in the [[Theory of combat]]&lt;ref&gt;pp.63-64, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; has been a dynamic one through the course of military history, changing with the changes in the organisation, employment and technology of military forces.  

While the British [[military historian]] [[John Keegan|Sir John Keegan]] suggested an ideal definition of battle as &quot;something which happens between two [[army|armies]] leading to the moral then physical disintegration of one or the other of them&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;p.302, Keegan&lt;/ref&gt; the origins and outcomes of battles can rarely be summarized so neatly.

In general a battle during the 20th century was, and continues to be, defined by the combat between opposing forces representing major components of total forces committed to a [[military campaign]], used to achieve specific [[military objective]]s, within a time-frame of less than a month.&lt;ref&gt;pp.65-71, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; Where the duration of the battle is longer then a week, it is often for reasons of [[staff operational planning]] called an ''operation''. Battles can be planned, [[encounter battle|encountered]], or forced by one force on the other when the latter is unable to [[Withdrawal (military)|withdraw]] from combat. 

A battle always has as its purpose the reaching of a [[mission goal]] by use of military force.&lt;ref name = &quot;lbcdnv&quot;&gt;p.67, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; A victory in the battle is achieved when one of the opposing sides forces the other to abandon its mission, or to [[surrender (military)|surrender]] its forces, or [[rout]]s the other, i.e., forces it to retreat or renders it militarily ineffective for further [[combat operation]]s. However, a battle may end in a [[Pyrrhic victory]], which ultimately favors the defeated party. If no resolution is reached in a battle, it can result in a [[stalemate]]. A conflict in which one side is unwilling to reach a decision by a direct battle using [[conventional military forces]] often becomes an [[insurgency]].

Until the 19th century the majority of battles were of short duration, many lasting a part of a day. (The [[Battle of Nations]] (1813) and the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (1863) were exceptional in lasting three days.) This was mainly due to the difficulty of supplying [[Army|armies]] in the field, or conducting [[Night operations (military)|night operations]]. The means of prolonging a battle was typically by employment of [[siege warfare]]. Improvements in [[transport]]ation and the sudden evolving of [[trench warfare]], with its siege-like nature during [[World War I]] in the 20th century, lengthened the duration of battles to days and weeks.&lt;ref name = &quot;lbcdnv&quot;/&gt; This created the requirement for [[unit rotation]] to prevent [[combat fatigue]],&lt;ref&gt;pp.62-63, Richardson&lt;/ref&gt; with troops preferably not remaining in a combat area of operations for more than a month. Trench warfare had become largely obsolete in conflicts between advanced armies by the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The use of the term &quot;battle&quot; in military history has led to its misuse when referring to almost any scale of combat, notably by strategic forces involving hundreds of thousands of troops that may be engaged in either a single battle at one time ([[Battle of Leipzig]]) or multiple operations ([[Battle of Kursk]]). The space a battle occupies depends on the range of the [[weapon]]s of the combatants.  A &quot;battle&quot; in this broader sense may occupy a large piece of spacetime, as in the case of the [[Battle of Britain]] or the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. Until the advent of [[artillery]] and [[aircraft]], battles were fought with the two sides within sight, if not reach, of each other. The depth of the battlefield has also increased in [[modern warfare]] with inclusion of the supporting units in the rear areas; supply, artillery, medical personnel etc. often outnumber the front-line combat troops.

Battles are, on the whole, made up of a multitude of individual combats, skirmishes and small [[Engagement (military)|engagements]] within the context of which the combatants will usually only experience a small part of the events of the battle's entirety. To the [[infantry]]man, there may be little to distinguish between combat as part of a minor raid or as a major offensive, nor is it likely that he anticipates the future course of the battle; few of the British infantry who went over the top on the [[first day on the Somme]], July 1, 1916, would have anticipated that they would be fighting the same battle in five months' time. Conversely, some of the Allied infantry who had just dealt a crushing defeat to the French at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] fully expected to have to fight again the next [[Battle of Wavre|day]].

==Battlespace==
{{Main|Battlespace}}
Battlespace is a unified strategy to integrate and combine [[armed forces]] for the [[military]] [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of operations]], including [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]], [[information]], [[Earth|land]], [[sea]] and [[space]]. It includes the environment, factors and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly [[armed forces]]; facilities; weather; terrain; and the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] within the operational areas and areas of interest.

== Factors within battles ==
Battles are decided by various factors. The number and quality of combatants and equipment, the skill of the [[commanders]] of each army, and the terrain advantages are among the most prominent factors. A unit may charge with high morale but less discipline and still emerge victorious. This tactic was effectively used by the early [[French Revolutionary Army|French Revolutionary Armies]]. 

Weapons and armour can be a decisive factor. On many occasions armies have achieved victories largely owing to the employment of more advanced weapons than those of their opponents. An extreme example was in the [[Battle of Omdurman]], in which a large army of Sudanese Mahdists armed in a traditional manner were destroyed by an Anglo-Egyptian force equipped with [[maxim gun]]s.
On some occasions, simple weapons employed in an unorthodox fashion have proven advantageous, as with the [[Swiss pikemen]] who gained many victories through their ability to transform a traditionally defensive weapon into an offensive one. Likewise, the [[Zulus]] in the early 19th century were victorious in battles against their rivals in part because they adopted a new kind of spear, the [[iklwa]]. Even so, forces with inferior weapons have still emerged victorious at times, for example in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and in the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]]. Discipline within the troops is often of greater importance; at the [[Battle of Alesia]], the Romans were greatly outnumbered but won because of superior training. 
 
Battles can also be determined by terrain. Capturing high ground, for example, has been the central strategy in innumerable battles. An army that holds the high ground forces the enemy to climb, and thus wear themselves down. Areas of dense vegetation, such as jungles and forest, act as force-multipliers, of benefit to inferior armies. Arguably, terrain is of less importance in modern warfare, due to the advent of aircraft, though terrain is still vital for camouflage, especially for [[guerrilla warfare]]. 

Generals and commanders also play a decisive role during combat. [[Hannibal]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] were all skilled generals and, consequently, their armies were extremely successful. An army that can trust the commands of their leaders with conviction in its success invariably has a higher morale than an army that doubts its every move. The British in the naval [[Battle of Trafalgar]], for example, owed its success to the reputation of celebrated admiral [[Lord Nelson]].

== Types of battle ==
[[Image:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Battle of Poltava]] between Russia and Sweden, by [[Denis Martens the Younger]] ]]

Battles can be fought on land, sea and in the modern age, in the air. [[Naval battle]]s have occurred since before the 5th century BC. Air battles have been far less common, due to their late conception, the most prominent being the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940. However since the [[World War II|Second World War]] land or sea battles have come to rely on air support. Indeed, during the [[Battle of Midway]], five [[aircraft carrier]]s were sunk without either fleet coming into direct contact.

There are numerous types of battles:

*A ''battle of encounter'' (or ''encounter battle'') is a [[meeting engagement]] where the opposing sides collide in the field without either having prepared their attack or defence.

*A ''battle of attrition'' aims to inflict losses on an enemy that are less sustainable compared to one's own losses.  These need not be greater numerical losses - if one side is much more numerous than the other than pursuing a strategy based on attrition can work even if casualties on both sides are about equal.  Many battles of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the First World War were intentionally ([[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]) or unintentionally ([[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]]) attrition battles.

*A ''battle of breakthrough'' aims to pierce the enemy's defences, thereby exposing the vulnerable flanks which can be turned.

*A ''battle of encirclement''&amp;mdash;the ''[[Kesselschlacht]]'' of the German ''[[Blitzkrieg]]''&amp;mdash;surrounds the enemy in a [[salients, re-entrants and pockets|pocket]].

*A ''battle of envelopment'' involves an attack on one or both [[Flanking maneuver|flank]]s; the classic example being the double-envelopment of the [[Battle of Cannae]].

*A ''battle of annihilation'' is one in which the defeated party is destroyed in the field, such as the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]].

Battles frequently do not fit one particular type perfectly, and are usually hybrids of different types listed above.

A ''decisive battle'' is one of particular importance; often by bringing hostilities to an end, such as the [[Battle of Hastings]] or the [[Battle of Hattin]], or as a turning point in the fortunes of the [[belligerent]]s, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. A decisive battle can have [[political]] as well as military impact, changing the balance of power or boundaries between countries. The concept of the ''decisive battle'' became popular with the publication in 1851 of [[Edward Creasy]]'s ''[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]''. British [[military historian]]s [[J.F.C. Fuller]] (''The Decisive Battles of the Western World'') and [[B.H. Liddell Hart]] (''Decisive Wars of History''), among many others, have written books in the style of Creasy's work.

== The differences among land battles throughout history ==
There is an obvious difference in the way battles have been fought throughout time. Early battles were probably fought between rival hunting bands as disorganized mobs. However, during the [[Battle of Megiddo]], the first reliably documented battle in the fifteenth century BC, actual discipline was instilled in both armies. However, during the many wars of the [[Roman Empire]], [[barbarians]] continued using [[mob tactics]]. 

As the [[Age of Enlightenment]] dawned, armies began to fight in highly disciplined lines. Each would follow the orders from their officers and fight as a single unit instead of individuals. Each army was successively divided into [[regiments]], [[battalions]], [[Company (military unit)|companies]], and [[platoons]]. These armies would march, line up, and fire in divisions. 

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], on the other hand, did not fight in lines, utilizing instead guerrilla tactics. American colonists and European forces continued using disciplined lines, continuing into the [[American Civil War]]. 

A new style, during [[World War I]], known as [[trench warfare]], developed nearly half a century later. This also led to [[radio]] for communication between battalions. [[Chemical warfare]] also emerged with the use of poisonous gas during [[World War I]]. 

By [[World War II]], the use of the smaller divisions, platoons and companies, became much more important as precise operations became vital. Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons. As a result, elite squads became much more recognized and distinguishable. 

[[Maneuver warfare]] also developed with an astonishing pace with the advent of the [[tank]], replacing the archaic cannons of the Enlightenment Age. Artillery has since gradually replaced the use of frontal troops. Modern battles now continue to resemble that of World War II, though prominent innovations have been added. Indirect combat through the use of aircraft and missiles now comprise of a large portion of wars in place of battles, where battles are now mostly reserved for capturing cities {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

== The evolution of naval warfare ==
One significant difference of modern naval battles as opposed to earlier forms of combat is the use of [[marine (military)|marines]], which introduced amphibious warfare. Today, a marine is actually an infantry regiment that sometimes fights solely on land and is no longer tied to the navy. A good example of an old naval battle is the [[Battle of Salamis]]. 

Most ancient naval battles were fought by fast ships using the [[battering ram]] to sink opposing fleets or steer close enough for boarding in hand-to-hand combat. Troops were often actually used to storm enemy ships as used by [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[piracy|pirates]]. This tactic was usually used by civilizations that could not beat the enemy with ranged weaponry. 

Another invention in the late [[Middle Ages]] was the use of [[Greek fire]] by the Byzantines, which was used to set enemy fleets on fire. Empty demolition ships utilized the tactic to crash into opposing ships and set it afire with an explosion. After the invention of cannons, naval warfare became useful as support units for land warfare.  

During the 19th century, the development of mines led to a new type of naval warfare. The [[ironclad]], first used in the [[American Civil War]], resistant to cannons, soon made the wooden ship obsolete. The invention of military [[submarines]], during [[World War I]], brought naval warfare to both above and below the surface. With the development of military aircraft during [[World War II]], battles were fought in the sky as well as below the ocean. [[Aircraft carriers]] have since become the central unit in naval warfare, acting as a mobile base for lethal aircraft.

== Aerial battles throughout history ==
Although the use of aircraft has for the most part always been used as a supplement to land or naval engagements, since their first major military use in World War I aircraft have increasingly taken on larger roles in warfare. During World War I, the primary use was for reconnaissance, and small-scale bombardment.

Aircraft began becoming much more prominent in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and especially World War II. Aircraft design began specializing, primarily into two types: bombers, which carried explosive payloads to bomb land targets or ships; and fighter-interceptors, which were used to either intercept incoming aircraft or to escort and protect bombers (engagements between fighter aircraft were known as [[dog fights]]). Some of the more notable aerial battles in this period include the [[Battle of Britain]] and the [[Battle of Midway]].

Another important use of aircraft came with the development of the [[helicopter]], which first became heavily used during the Vietnam War, and still continues to be widely used today to transport and augment ground forces.

Today, direct engagements between aircraft are rare - the most modern fighter-interceptors carry much more extensive bombing payloads, and are used to bomb precision land targets, rather than to fight other aircraft. Anti-aircraft batteries are used much more extensively to defend against incoming aircraft than interceptors. Despite this, aircraft today are much more extensively used as the primary tools for both army and navy, as evidenced by the prominent use of helicopters to transport and support troops, the use of aerial bombardment as the &quot;first strike&quot; in many engagements, and the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the center of most modern navies.

== Battle naming ==
[[Image:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Battle of Gibraltar]]'' of 1607 by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]].]]

Battles are almost invariably named after some feature of the battlefield [[geography]], such as the name of a town, forest or river, commonly prefixed &quot;Battle of...&quot;. Occasionally battles are named after the date on which they took place, such as [[The Glorious First of June]].  

In the [[Middle Ages]] it was considered important to settle on a suitable name for a battle which could be used by the [[chronicler]]s. For example, after [[Henry V of England]] defeated a French army on October 25, 1415, he met with the senior French [[herald]] and they agreed to name the battle after the nearby [[castle]] and so it was called the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. 

In other cases, the sides adopted different names for the same battle, such as the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which is known in Turkey as the [[Battle of Çanakkale]]. During the American Civil War, the Union tended to name the battles after the nearest watercourse, such as the Battle of Wilsons Creek and the Battle of Stones River, whereas the Confederates favoured the nearby towns, as in the Battles of Chancellorsville and Murfreesboro. Occasionally both names for the same battle entered the popular culture, such as the battle of Antietam, which is also referred to as the battle of Sharpsburg.

Sometimes in desert warfare, there is no nearby town name to use; map coordinates gave the name to the [[Battle of 73 Easting]] in the [[First Gulf War]].

Some place names have become [[synonymous]] with the battles that took place there, such as the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], [[Battle of the Alamo|the Alamo]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], or [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].  [[Military operation]]s, many of which result in battle, are given [[codename]]s, which are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the type or the location of the battle. [[Operation Market Garden]] and [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] are examples of battles known by their military codenames.  

When a battleground is the site of more than one battle in the same conflict, the instances are distinguished by [[ordinal number]], such as the [[First Battle of Bull Run|First]] and [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Battles of Bull Run]]. An extreme case are the twelve [[Battles of the Isonzo]]&amp;mdash;[[First Battle of the Isonzo|First]] to [[Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo|Twelfth]]&amp;mdash;between Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]] during the First World War.

Some battles are named for the convenience of [[military historian]]s so that periods of combat can be neatly distinguished from one another. Following the First World War, the British Battles Nomenclature Committee was formed to decide on standard names for all battles and subsidiary actions. To the soldiers who did the fighting, the distinction was usually academic; a soldier fighting at [[Beaumont Hamel]] on November 13, 1916 was probably unaware he was taking part in what the committee would call the &quot;[[Battle of the Ancre]]&quot;.

Many combats are too small to merit a name. Terms such as &quot;action&quot;, &quot;skirmish&quot;, &quot;firefight&quot;, &quot;raid&quot; or &quot;offensive patrol&quot; are used to describe small-scale battle-like encounters. These combats often take place within the time and space of a battle and while they may have an objective, they are not necessarily &quot;decisive&quot;. Sometimes the soldiers are unable to immediately gauge the significance of the combat; in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Waterloo]], some British officers were in doubt as to whether the day's events merited the title of &quot;battle&quot; or would be passed off as merely an &quot;action&quot;.

== The effects of a battle ==
Battles affect the individuals who take part, as well as the political actors. Personal effects of battle range from mild psychological issues to permanent and crippling injuries. Many battle-survivors have nightmares about the conditions they encountered, or abnormal reactions to certain sights or sounds. Some suffer [[Flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashbacks]]. Physical effects of battle can include scars, amputations, lesions, loss of bodily functions, blindness, paralysis — and death.

Battles also affect [[politics]]. A decisive battle can cause the losing side to surrender, while a [[Pyrrhic Victory]] such as the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] can cause the winning side to reconsider its long-term goals. Battles in [[civil wars]] have often decided the fate of [[monarchs]] or political factions. Famous examples include the [[Wars of the Roses|War of the Roses]], as well as the [[Jacobite Uprisings]]. Battles also affect the commitment of one side or the other to the continuance of a war, for example the [[Battle of Incheon]] and the [[Battle of Hue]] during the [[Tet Offensive]].

'''Berinthia''' &quot;'''Berry'''&quot; '''Berenson Perkins''' (April 14, 1948 – September 11, 2001) was an American photographer, actress, and model. Perkins was also known as the wife of actor [[Anthony Perkins]] and died in the [[September 11 attacks]] as a passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 11]].

==Biography==
Berinthia Berenson was the younger daughter of Robert L. Berenson, an American diplomat turned shipping executive, who was of [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] [[Jewish]] descent; his family's original surname was Valvrojenski.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berenson, &quot;Sketch for a Self-Portrait&quot;, NY: Pantheon, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Robert L. Berenson, Ex-Envoy and Head of Shipping Line, Dies&quot;, The New York Times, 3 February 1965, page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was born Countess Maria Luisa Yvonne Radha de Wendt de Kerlor, better known as [[Gogo Schiaparelli]], a socialite of [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[French people|French]], and [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] ancestry.&lt;ref name = &quot;htgxkf&quot;&gt;Elsa Schiaparelli, &quot;Shocking Life&quot;, NY: Dutton, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;She married, as her second husband, Gino, Marchese Cacciapuoti di Giugliano, an actor and director.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her maternal grandmother was the Italian-born fashion designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]],&lt;ref&gt;Linda Greenhouse, &quot;Schiaparelli Dies in Paris; Brought Color to Fashion&quot;, The New York Times, 15 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and her maternal grandfather was Count Wilhelm de Wendt de Kerlor, a [[Theosophy|Theosophist]] and [[psychic medium]].&lt;ref name = &quot;htgxkf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurman |first=Judith |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/27/031027fa_fact_thurman |title=New Yorker article about Elsa Schiaparelli |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritmanlibrary.nl/c/p/h/bel_18.html |title=Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica entry |publisher=Ritmanlibrary.nl |date=2006-02-27 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her elder sister, [[Marisa Berenson]], became a well-known model and actress. She also was a great-grandniece of [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]], an Italian astronomer who believed he had discovered the supposed canals of [[Mars]], and a great-grandniece of art expert [[Bernard Berenson]] (1865–1959) and his sister [[Senda Berenson]] (1868–1954), an athlete and educator who was one of the first two women elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125376/Senda-Berenson#668134.hook |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online entry |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1954-02-16 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Following a brief modeling career in the late 1960s, Berenson became a freelance photographer.
By 1973, her photographs had been published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''&lt;!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%28magazine%29]--&gt;, ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judy Klemesrud]], &quot;And Now, Make Room for the Berenson Sisters&quot;, The New York Times, 19 April 1973, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

She also appeared in several motion pictures, including ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'', with [[Malcolm McDowell]]. She starred opposite [[Anthony Perkins]] in the 1978 [[Alan Rudolph]] film ''[[Remember My Name (film)|Remember My Name]]'' and opposite [[Jeff Bridges]] in the 1979 film ''[[Winter Kills]]''.

===Marriage===
On 9&amp;nbsp;August 1973, in [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]], Berenson married the actor [[Anthony Perkins]]. They had two sons: the actor-musician [[Oz Perkins]] (born 2&amp;nbsp;February 1974) and the folk/rock recording artist [[Elvis Perkins]] (born 9&amp;nbsp;February 1976).&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Maynard, &quot;Tony Perkins and Family: A Study in Informal Togetherness&quot;, The New York Times, Westchester Weekly Section, 12&amp;nbsp;January 1977, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; They remained married until Perkins' death of [[AIDS]] on 12&amp;nbsp;September 1992.

===Death===
Berenson died at age 53 in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] aboard [[American Airlines Flight 11]], one day before the 9th anniversary of Perkins' death. She was returning to her [[California]] home following a holiday on [[Cape Cod]].

{{For||Botany (disambiguation)|Botanic (disambiguation)}}
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'' commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stem-cross-section.jpg|thumb|Example of a cross section of a stem &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydroponicist.com Winterborne J, 2005. ''Hydroponics - Indoor Horticulture'']&lt;/ref&gt; {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

'''Botany''', '''plant science'''('''s'''), or '''plant biology''' is a branch of [[biology]] that involves the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of plant [[life]]. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines concerned with the study of [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[fungi]], including [[Plant anatomy|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[reproduction]], [[metabolism]], [[morphogenesis|development]], [[phytopathology|diseases]], chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences.  Today botanists study over 550,000 [[species]] of living organisms.

The term &quot;botany&quot; comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] βοτάνη, meaning &quot;[[pasture]], [[grass]], [[fodder]]&quot;, perhaps via the idea of a [[livestock]] keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.

==Scope and importance of botany==
[[File:Beli-hibiskus.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hibiscus]]]]As with other life forms in biology, plant life can be studied from different perspectives, from the [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] level through [[organelle]]s, [[cell biology|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], individuals, plant [[population]]s, and communities of plants. At each of these levels a botanist might be concerned with the classification ([[taxonomy]]), structure ([[Plant anatomy|anatomy]] and [[Plant morphology|morphology]]), or function ([[Plant physiology|physiology]]) of plant life.

Historically all living things were grouped as animals or plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Chapman, Jasmin, et al.| authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Science Web | date= | publisher=Nelson Thornes | location= | isbn=0-17-438746-6 | pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and botany covered all organisms not considered [[animal]]s. Some organisms once included in the field of botany are no longer considered to belong to the plant [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] &amp;ndash; these include [[fungi]] (studied in [[mycology]]), [[lichen]]s ([[lichenology]]), [[bacterium|bacteria]] ([[bacteriology]]), [[viruses]] ([[virology]]) and single-celled [[alga]]e, which are now grouped as part of the [[Protista]]. However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi, lichens, bacteria and [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.

The study of plants is vital because they are a fundamental part of [[life on Earth]], which generates the [[oxygen]], [[food]], [[fibre]]s, fuel and [[medicine]] that allow humans and other life forms to exist. Through [[photosynthesis]], plants absorb [[carbon dioxide]], a [[greenhouse gas]] that in large amounts can affect global climate. Additionally, they prevent [[soil erosion]] and are influential in the [[water cycle]]. A good understanding of plants is crucial to the future of human societies as it allows us to:
* Produce food to feed an expanding population
* Understand fundamental life processes
* Produce medicine and materials to treat diseases and other ailments
* Understand environmental changes more clearly

[[paleobotany|Paleobotanists]] study ancient plants in the fossil record. It is believed that early in the Earth's history, the evolution of photosynthetic plants altered the global [[atmosphere]] of the earth, changing the ancient atmosphere by [[oxidation]].

===Human nutrition===
[[File:US long grain rice.jpg|right|thumb|Nearly all the food we eat comes (directly and indirectly) from plants like this American long grain [[rice]]]]
Virtually all foods eaten come from plants, either directly from [[staple food]]s and other [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]], or indirectly through [[livestock]] or other animals, which rely on plants for their nutrition.  Plants are the fundamental base of nearly all [[food chain]]s because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting them into a form that can be consumed and utilized by animals; this is what ecologists call the first [[trophic level]]. Botanists also study how plants produce food we can eat and how to increase yields and therefore their work is important in mankind's ability to feed the world and provide [[food security]] for future generations, for example, through [[plant breeding]]. Botanists also study [[weed]]s, plants which are considered to be a nuisance in a particular location.  Weeds are a considerable problem in [[agriculture]], and botany provides some of the basic science used to understand how to minimize 'weed' impact in agriculture and native [[ecosystems]].   [[Ethnobotany]] is the study of the relationships between plants and people, and when this kind of study is turned to the investigation of plant-people relationships in past times, it is referred to as [[archaeobotany]] or [[paleoethnobotany]].

===Fundamental life processes===
Plants are convenient organisms in which fundamental life processes (like [[cell division]] and [[protein synthesis]]) can be studied, without the ethical dilemmas of studying animals or humans. The [[Mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] were discovered in this way by [[Gregor Mendel]], who was studying the way [[peas|pea]] shape is inherited. What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany. Additionally, [[Barbara McClintock]] discovered '[[transposon|jumping genes']] by studying [[maize]]. These are a few examples that demonstrate how botanical research has an ongoing relevance to the understanding of fundamental biological processes.

===Medicine and materials===
Many [[medication|medicinal]] and [[recreational drugs]], like [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], [[caffeine]], and [[nicotine]] come directly from the plant kingdom. Others are simple [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of botanical natural products; for example, [[aspirin]] is based on the pain killer [[salicylic acid]] which originally came from the [[bark]] of [[willow]] trees. As well, the [[narcotic]] [[analgesics]] such as [[morphine]] are derived from the [[opium poppy]].&lt;ref name=JMannSecondaryMetabolism&gt;{{Cite book

There may be many [[drug discovery|novel cures for diseases]] provided by plants, waiting to be discovered. Popular [[stimulant]]s like [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[tobacco]], and [[tea]] also come from plants. Most [[alcoholic beverage]]s come from [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]] plants such as [[barley]] ([[beer]]), [[rice]] ([[sake]]) and [[grapes]] ([[wine]]).

Plants also provide us with many natural materials, such as [[hemp]], [[cotton]], [[wood]], [[paper]], [[linen]], [[vegetable oil]]s, some types of [[rope]], and [[rubber]]. The production of [[silk]] would not be possible without the cultivation of the [[mulberry]] plant. [[Sugarcane]], [[rapeseed]], [[soy]] and other plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content have recently been put to use as sources of [[biofuel]]s, which are important alternatives to [[fossil fuel]]s (see [[biodiesel]]).

===Environmental changes===
Plants can also help us understand changes in on our environment in many ways.

*Understanding [[habitat destruction]] and [[endangered species|species extinction]] is dependent on an accurate and complete catalog of plant [[systematics]] and taxonomy.
*Plant responses to [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] can help us monitor problems like [[ozone depletion]].
*[[palynology|Analyzing pollen]] deposited by plants [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years ago]] can help scientists to reconstruct past climates and predict future ones, an essential part of [[climate change]] research.
*Recording and analyzing the timing of plant [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] are important parts of [[phenology]] used in climate-change research.
*[[Lichens]], which are sensitive to atmospheric conditions, have been extensively used as [[pollution]] indicators.

In many different ways, plants can act a little like the '[[canary|miners' canary']], an early warning system alerting us to important changes in our environment. In addition to these practical and scientific reasons, plants are extremely valuable as recreation for millions of people who enjoy [[gardening]], [[horticulture|horticultural]] and [[herb|culinary]] uses of plants every day.

==History==
{{Main|History of botany}}
[[File:Botany.jpg|thumb|right|The traditional tools of a botanist]]

===Early botany===
The [[History of botany]] begins with ancient writings on, and classifications of, plants. Such writings are found in several early cultures. Examples of early botanical works have been found in [[Ancient India]]n sacred texts, ancient [[Zoroastrian]] writings,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and Ancient Chinese works.

The Greco-Roman world produced a number of botanical works including the [[Historia Plantarum]] and De [[Materia Medica]].

Works from the medieval Muslim world included [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s Nabatean Agriculture, [[Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī]]'s (828-896) the ''Book of Plants'', and [[Ibn Bassal]]'s ''The Classification of Soils''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) also wrote on botany.

===Early modern botany===
[[File:H J N Crantz Classis cruciformium.jpg|thumb|[[Crantz]]'s ''Classis cruciformium...'', 1769]]
[[Germany|German]] physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501–1566) was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489-1534) and [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498–1554) (also called  Hieronymus Tragus).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/852/?article_id=131 Early herbals – The German fathers of botany]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valerius Cordus]] (1515–1554) authored a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/valerius-cordus-scit-0312/ Valerius Cordus | Science and Its Times: 1450-1699 Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 16th century, the Italian [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] was scientifically researching plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]] in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue. The [[Germans]] [[Jacob Theodor Klein]] and [[Leonhart Fuchs]], the Swiss [[Conrad von Gesner]], and the British author [[Nicholas Culpeper]] published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants.

During the 18th century, systems of classification became deliberately artificial and served only for the purpose of identification. These classifications are comparable to diagnostic keys, where taxa are artificially grouped in pairs by few, easily recognisable characters. The sequence of the taxa in keys is often totally unrelated to their natural or phyletic groupings. In the 18th century an increasing number of new plants had arrived in Europe, from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide, and a larger amount of plants became available for study.

In 1754 [[Carolus Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]] (Carl Linnaeus) divided the plant Kingdom into 25 classes. One, the ''Cryptogamia'', included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95&quot;&gt;Hoek, C. van den, Mann, D.G. and Jahns, H.M. 2005. ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xuUoiFesSHMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Algae: An Introduction to Phycology]''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. ISBN  0 521 30419 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased knowledge on anatomy, morphology and life cycles, lead to the realization that there were more natural affinities between plants, than the sexual system of Linnaeus indicated. [[Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems that were widely followed. The ideas of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism for [[evolution]] required adaptations to the [[Candollean system]], which started the studies on evolutionary relationships and [[phylogenetic classification]]s of plants.

Botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first “modern” text book, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundzuge der Wissenschaftlichen}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow|Carl Willdenow]] examined the connection between seed dispersal and distribution, the nature of plant associations and the impact of geological history. The cell nucleus was discovered by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.

===Modern botany===
A considerable amount of new knowledge today is being generated from studying [[model organisms|model plants]] like ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. This weedy species in the mustard family was one of the first plants to have its [[genome]] sequenced. The sequencing of the [[rice]] (''Oryza sativa'') genome, its relatively small genome, and a large international research community have made rice an important [[cereal]]/[[grass]]/[[monocot]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3870991 | title = Genome Relationships: The Grass Model in Current Research | year = 2000 | author = Devos, Katrien M. | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 12 | pages = 637 | url = http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/12/5/637 | format = free full text | pmid = 10810140 | last2 = Gale | first2 = MD | issue = 5 | pmc = 139917 | jstor = 3870991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another grass species, ''[[Brachypodium distachyon]]'' is also emerging as an experimental model for understanding the genetic, cellular and molecular biology of temperate grasses. Other commercially important staple foods like [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[pearl millet]] and [[soybean]] are also having their genomes sequenced. Some of these are challenging to sequence because they have more than two [[haploid]] (n) sets of [[chromosome]]s, a condition known as [[polyploid]]y, common in the plant kingdom. ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a single-celled, green [[Algae|alga]]) is another plant model organism that has been extensively studied and provided important insights into cell biology.

In 1998 the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogeny]] of flowering plants based on an analysis of [[DNA]] sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, major questions such as which families represent the earliest branches in the genealogy of [[angiosperms]] are now understood.  Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.

'''''Bacillus thuringiensis''''' (or '''Bt''') is a [[Gram-positive]], soil-dwelling [[bacterium]], commonly used as a biological alternative to a [[pesticide]]; alternatively, the [[Cry toxin]] may be extracted and used as a pesticide. ''B. thuringiensis'' also occurs naturally in the gut of [[caterpillar]]s of various types of [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]], as well as on the dark surface of plants.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors) | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2005 | isbn= 0-1...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[sporulation]] many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called [[δ-endotoxins]], that have [[insecticidal]] action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to [[genetically modified crops]] using Bt genes. There are however many crystal-producing Bt [[strain (biology)|strains]] that do not have insecticidal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|18051264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and study==
''B. thuringiensis'' was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese [[biologist]] Shigetane Ishiwatari. In 1911, ''B. thuringiensis'' was rediscovered in Germany by Ernst Berliner, who isolated it as the cause of a disease called ''Schlaffsucht'' in flour moth caterpillars. In 1976, Zakharyan reported the presence of a plasmid in a strain of ''B. thuringiensis'' and suggested the plasmid's involvement in endospore and crystal formation.&lt;ref&gt;Zakharyan R.A ''et. el.'' (1979). &quot;Plasmid DNA from Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;. Microbiologiya 48 (2): 226–229. ISSN 0026-3656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Clement Cheng,(1984) Pathogens of invertebrates: application in biological control and transmission mechanisms, ''Society for Invertebrate Pathology Meeting'' Volume 7 page 159 [http://books.google.com/books?cd=1&amp;id=TugDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Zakharyan+thuringiensis&amp;q=Zakharyan#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. thuringiensis'' is closely related to ''[[Bacillus cereus|B.cereus]]'', a soil bacterium, and ''[[Bacillus anthracis|B.anthracis]]'', the cause of [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]]: the three organisms differ mainly in their [[plasmid]]s. Like other members of the genus, all three are [[aerobe]]s capable of producing [[endospore]]s.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; Upon sporulation, ''B. thuringiensis'' forms crystals of  [[proteinaceous]] insecticidal [[δ-endotoxin]]s (called crystal proteins or Cry proteins), which are encoded by ''cry'' genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Circkmore N |url=http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/index.html |title=Bacillus thuringiensis toxin nomenclature |work= |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most strains of ''B. thuringiensis'' the ''cry'' genes are located on the plasmid.&lt;ref name=Stahly&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stahly D.P | title=Biochemical Genetics of the Bacterial Insect-Control Agent Bacillus thuringiensis: Basic Principles and Prospects Engineering. |year =1984 |journal=Biotechnol.

Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders [[Lepidoptera]] (moths and butterflies), [[Diptera]] (flies and mosquitoes), [[Coleoptera]] (beetles), [[hymenoptera]] ([[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[sawfly|sawflies]]) and [[nematode]]s. Thus, ''B. thuringiensis'' serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified crops]]. When insects ingest toxin crystals, the alkaline pH of their digestive tract activates the toxin. Cry toxin gets inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, forming a pore.  The pore results in cell lysis and eventual death of the insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Babu M, Geetha M | url=http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/madanm/articles/dnashuff.htm |title=DNA shuffling of Cry proteins |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dean1984&gt;Dean D.H.

==Use in pest control==
Spores and crystalline insecticidal [[protein]]s produced by ''B. thuringiensis'' have been used to control insect pests since the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemaux|first=Peggy|date=February 19, 2008|title=Genetically Engineered Plants and Foods: A Scientist's Analysis of the Issues (Part I)|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|volume=59|pages=771–812|url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.58.032806.103840|accessdate=9 May 2009|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.58.032806.103840|pmid=18284373}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now used as specific [[insecticide]]s under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these [[pesticide]]s are regarded as [[environmentally friendly]], with little or no effect on [[human]]s, [[wildlife]], [[pollinator]]s, and most other [[beneficial insect]]s. The [[Belgium|Belgian]] company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] was the first company (in 1985) to develop genetically engineered ([[tobacco]]) plants with insect tolerance by expressing ''cry'' genes from ''B. thuringiensis''.&lt;ref name=Hofte_1986&gt;{{cite journal |author=Höfte H, de Greve H, Seurinck J |title=Structural and functional analysis of a cloned delta endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis berliner 1715 |journal=Eur.

''B. thuringiensis''-based insecticides are often applied as liquid sprays on crop plants, where the insecticide must be ingested to be effective. It is thought that the solubilized toxins form pores in the midgut epithelium of susceptible larvae. Recent research has suggested that the midgut bacteria of susceptible larvae are required for ''B. thuringiensis'' insecticidal activity.&lt;ref name=Broderick_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Broderick NA, Raffa KF, Handelsman J |title=Midgut bacteria required for Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal activity |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=41 |pages=15196–9 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17005725 |pmc=1622799 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604865103 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17005725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis|''Bacillus thuringiensis'' serovar ''israelensis'']], a strain of ''B. thuringiensis'' is widely used as a [[larvicide]] against [[mosquito]] [[larva]]e, where it is also considered an environmentally friendly method of [[mosquito control]].

==Genetic engineering for pest control==

===Usage===
In 1995, potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved safe by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=A0YyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4631,1776980&amp;dq=bacillus+thuringiensis+potato+1996+approved&amp;hl= Genetically Altered Potato Ok'd For Crops]
Lawrence Journal-World - 6 May 1995&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, [[Transgenic maize#Bt corn|Bt Maize]], Bt Potato and Bt cotton were being grown by farmers in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irri.org/publications/irrn/pdfs/vol25no2/IRRN25-2Minireview.pdf Bt Rice: Practical steps to sustainable use. IRRI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bt crops (in corn and cotton) were planted on 281,500&amp;nbsp;km² in 2006 (165,600&amp;nbsp;km² of Bt corn and 115900&amp;nbsp;km² of Bt cotton). This was equivalent to 11.1% and 33.6% respectively of global plantings of corn and cotton in 2006.&lt;ref name = &quot;klbbfu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Brookes G, Barfoot P | url=http://www.pgeconomics.co.uk/pdf/global_impactstudy_2006_v1_finalPGEconomics.pdf |title=GM crops: the first ten years - global socio-economic and environmental impacts |format=PDF |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of major benefits to farmers, including poor farmers in developing countries, have been made by advocates of the technology, and have been challenged by opponents. The task of isolating impacts of the technology is complicated by the prevalence of biased observers, and by the rarity of controlled comparisons (such as identical seeds, differing only in the presence or absence of the Bt trait, being grown in identical situations).  The main Bt crop being grown by small farmers in developing countries is cotton, and a recent exhaustive review of findings on Bt cotton by respected and unbiased agricultural economists concluded that &quot;the overall balance sheet, though promising, is mixed. Economic returns are highly variable over years, farm type, and geographical location&quot; .&lt;ref name=Smale_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smale M, Zambrano P,  Cartel M |title=Bales and Balance: A Review of the Methods Used to Assess the Economic Impact of Bt Cotton on Farmers in Developing Economies |journal=AgBioForum |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=195–212 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental impacts appear to be positive during the first ten years of Bt crop use (1996–2005).  One study concluded that insecticide use on cotton and corn during this period fell by 35.6 million kg of insecticide active ingredient which is roughly equal to the amount of pesticide applied to arable crops in the EU in one year. Using the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) measure of the impact of pesticide use on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Kovach J, Petzoldt C, Degni J, Tette J | url=http://www.nysipm.cornell.edu/publications/eiq/ |title=A Method to Measure the Environmental Impact of Pesticides |publisher=New York State Agricultural Experiment Station |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of Bt technology over this ten year period resulted in 24.3% and 4.6% reduction respectively in the environmental impact associated with insecticide use on the cotton and corn area using the technology.&lt;ref name = &quot;klbbfu&quot;/&gt;

===Advantages===
There are several advantages in expressing Bt toxins in transgenic Bt crops:

* The level of toxin expression can be very high thus delivering sufficient dosage to the pest.
* The toxin expression is contained within the plant system and hence only those insects that feed on the crop perish.
* The toxin expression can be modulated by using [[tissue-specific promoters]], and replaces the use of synthetic pesticides in the environment. The latter observation has been well documented worldwide.&lt;ref name = &quot;klbbfu&quot;/&gt;

===Health and safety===
Overall, Bt-modified crops appear to be environmentally safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomson, Jennifer A. |title=Seeds for the future: the impact of genetically modified crops on the environment|publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=2007|pages= |isbn=0-8014-7368-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proteins produced by Bt have been used in sprays for agricultural weed control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with seemingly no ill effects on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/bt_history.html |title=History of Bt |author= |date= |work= |publisher= University of Californis|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bt toxins are considered environmentally friendly by many farmers{{Who|date=June 2009}} and may be a potential alternative to broad spectrum insecticides. The toxicity of each Bt type is limited to one or two insect orders, and is nontoxic to vertebrates and many beneficial arthropods. The reason is that Bt works by binding to the appropriate receptor on the surface of midgut [[epithelial cells]]. Any organism that lacks the appropriate receptors in its gut cannot be affected by Bt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gill SS, Cowles EA, Pietrantonio PV |title=The mode of action of Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxins |journal=Annu. Rev. Entomol. |volume=37 |issue= |pages=615–36 |year=1992 |pmid=1311541 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.37.010192.003151 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.en.37.010192.003151?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Knowles BH | year=1994 | title = Mechanism of action of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal delta-endotoxins | journal=Advances in Insect Physiology | volume = 24 | pages= 275–308 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2806(08)60085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is clear evidence from laboratory settings that Bt toxins can affect non-target organisms. Usually, but not always, affected organisms are closely related to intended targets.&lt;ref&gt;Lovei and Arpaia 2005 and Hilbeck and Schmidt 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, exposure occurs through the consumption of plant parts such as pollen or plant debris, or through Bt ingested by their predatory [[food]] choices. The methodology used by these researchers has been called into quesiton.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton et. al (2009). Setting the record straight: a rebuttal to an erroneous analysis on transgenic insecticidal crops and natural enemies. J Transgenic Res. http://www.ask-force.org/web/Bt/Shelton-Setting-Record-Straight-Lovei-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to significant data gaps, the real-world consequences of Bt transgenics remains unclear.

Not all scientific reports on Bt safety have been positive. A 2007 study funded by the European arm of [[Greenpeace]], suggested the possibility of a slight but statistically meaningful risk of liver damage in rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Séralini et al.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Séralini GE, Cellier D, de Vendomois JS |title=New analysis of a rat feeding study with a genetically modified maize reveals signs of hepatorenal toxicity |journal=Arch.

Toxicol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=596–602 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17356802 |doi=10.1007/s00244-006-0149-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While small statistically significant changes may have been observed, statistical differences are both probable and predictable in animal studies of this kind,(known as [[Type I error]]s), that is, the probability of finding a false-positive due to chance alone. In this case, the number of positive results was within the statistically predicted range for Type I errors. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The observed changes have been found to be of no biological significance by the [[European Food Safety Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efsa.eu.int/EFSA/News_PR/PR_MON863__final,0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of Bt crops===
[[Image:Btcornafrica.jpg|thumb|Kenyans examining insect-resistant transgenic Bt corn.]]
Constant exposure to a toxin creates [[evolutionary pressure]] for pests resistant to that toxin. Already, a [[Diamondback moth]] population is known to have acquired resistance to Bt in spray form (i.e., not engineered) when used in organic agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Biello D | title=Organic Mystery | journal= Scientific American | month=December | year=2006 | page= 33 (quote by Bruce Tabashnik, University of Arizona) | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=organic-mystery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same researcher has now reported the first documented case of pest resistance to biotech cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.physorg.com/news121614449.html | title =First documented case of pest resistance to biotech cotton| publisher=University of Arizona| date=2008-02-07 | accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tabashnik BE, Gassmann AJ, Crowder DW, Carriére Y |title=Insect resistance to Bt crops: evidence versus theory |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=199–202 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18259177 |doi=10.1038/nbt1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method of reducing resistance is the creation of non-Bt crop refuges to allow some non-resistant insects to survive and maintain a susceptible population. To reduce the chance that an insect would become resistant to a Bt crop, the commercialization of transgenic cotton and maize in 1996 was accompanied with a management strategy to prevent insects from becoming resistant to Bt crops, and insect resistance management plans are mandatory for Bt crops planted in the USA and other countries. The aim is to encourage a large population of pests so that any genes for resistance are greatly diluted. This technique is based on the assumption that resistance genes will be recessive.

This means that with sufficiently high levels of transgene expression, nearly all of the heterozygotes (S/s), the largest segment of the pest population carrying a resistance allele, will be killed before they reach maturity, thus preventing transmission of the resistance gene to their progenies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Roush RT | year= 1997 | title=Bt-transgenic crops: just another pretty insecticide or a chance for a new start in resistance management? | journal = Pestic. Sci. | volume = 51 | issue =3 | pages=328–34 | doi =10.1002/(SICI)1096-9063(199711)51:3&lt;328::AID-PS650&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planting of refuges (i. e., fields of non-transgenic plants) adjacent to fields of transgenic plants increases the likelihood that homozygous resistant (s/s) individuals and any surviving heterozygotes will mate with susceptible (S/S) individuals from the refuge, instead of with other individuals carrying the resistance allele. As a result, the resistance gene frequency in the population would remain low.

Nevertheless, there are limitations that can affect the success of the high-dose/refuge strategy. For example, expression of the Bt gene can vary. For instance, if the temperature is not ideal this stress can lower the toxin production and make the plant more susceptible. More importantly, reduced late-season expression of toxin has been documented, possibly resulting from [[DNA methylation]] of the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | unused_data= Dong HZ, Li WJ | year= 2007 | title= Variability of Endotoxin Expression in Bt Transgenic Cotton | journal= Journal of Agronomy &amp; Crop Science | volume= 193 | pages=21–9 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00240.x | author= Dong, H. Z. | last2= Li | first2= W. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  So, while the high-dose/refuge strategy has been successful at prolonging the durability of Bt crops, this success has also had much to do with key factors independent of management strategy, including low initial resistance allele frequencies, fitness costs associated with resistance, and the abundance of non-Bt host plants that have supplemented the refuges planted as part of the resistance management strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tabashnik BE, Carrière Y, Dennehy TJ |title=Insect resistance to transgenic Bt crops: lessons from the laboratory and field |journal=J.

====Insect resistance====
In November 2009, [[Monsanto]] scientists found that the [[pink bollworm]] had become resistant to Bt cotton in parts of [[Gujarat]], India. In four regions, [[Amreli]], [[Bhavnagar]], [[Junagarh]] and [[Rajkot]] the crop is no longer effective at killing the pests. This was the first instance of Bt resistance that was confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx Cotton in India]&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto confirmed field resistance of the worm to the ''Cry1Ac'' first generation Bollgard cotton, which expresses a single Bt gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.327.5972.1439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secondary pests====
Chinese farmers have found that after seven years of growing BT cotton the populations of other insects other than [[bollworm]]s, such as [[mirids]], have become significant problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2010| volume=328|pmid=20466880| issue=5982| pages= 1151–1154 |doi=10.1126/science.1187881|title=Mirid Bug Outbreaks in Multiple Crops Correlated with Wide-Scale Adoption of Bt Cotton in China|author=Yanhui Lu, Kongming Wu, Yuying Jiang, Bing Xia, Ping Li, Hongqiang Feng, Kris A.

==Possible problems==
{{See|Genetically modified food controversies}}

===Lepidopteran toxicity===
The most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the [[monarch butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Losey JE, Rayor LS, Carter ME |title=Transgenic pollen harms monarch larvae |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6733 |pages=214 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10353241 |doi=10.1038/20338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report was puzzling&lt;!-- why? lepidopterans feed on pollen selectively --&gt; because the pollen from most maize hybrids contains much lower levels of Bt than the rest of the plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mendelsohn M, Kough J, Vaituzis Z, Matthews K |title=Are Bt crops safe? |journal=Nat.

It appears that the initial study was flawed by faulty pollen-collection procedure; researchers fed non-toxic pollen mixed with [[anther]] walls  containing Bt toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hellmich RL, Siegfried BD, Sears MK |title=Monarch larvae sensitivity to Bacillus thuringiensis- purified proteins and pollen |journal=Proc.

===Wild maize genetic contamination===
A study in ''Nature'' reported that Bt-containing maize genes was contaminating maize in its center of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Quist D, Chapela IH |title=Transgenic DNA introgressed into traditional maize landraces in Oaxaca, Mexico |journal=Nature |volume=414 |issue=6863 |pages=541–3 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11734853 |doi=10.1038/35107068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Nature'' later &quot;concluded that the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaplinsky N, Braun D, Lisch D, Hay A, Hake S, Freeling M |title=Biodiversity (Communications arising): maize transgene results in Mexico are artefacts |journal=Nature |volume=416 |issue=6881 |pages=601–2; discussion 600, 602 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11935145 |doi=10.1038/nature739}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there still remains a controversy over the highly unorthodox retraction on the part of Nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;http://www.pbs.org/now/science/genenature.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_17133.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Chapela, one of the original paper's authors spoke out against Berkeley accepting a multi-million dollar research grant from the Swiss pharmaceutical company, [[Novartis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;/&gt;

A subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, failed to find any evidence of contamination in Oaxaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ortiz-García S, Ezcurra E, Schoel B, Acevedo F, Soberón J, Snow AA |title=Absence of detectable transgenes in local landraces of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico (2003-2004) |journal=Proc.

However, further studies, such as that published in ''Molecular Ecology'' in 2008, have shown some small-scale (about 1%) genetic contamination (by the [[35S promoter]]) in sampled fields in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/modified-genes-found-in-local-mexican-maize.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081112/full/456149a.html&lt;/ref&gt; One [[meta-study]] has found evidence for and against Bt contamination of maize, concluding that the preponderance of evidence points to Bt maize contamination in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5%5B247%3ATPIMIT%5D2.0.CO%3B2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible link to Colony Collapse Disorder===
As of 2007, a new phenomenon called [[Colony Collapse Disorder]] (CCD) is affecting [[Honey bee|bee]] hives all over North America.

[[Image:PhageExterior.svg|right|thumb|300px|The structure of a typical tailed bacteriophage]]

A '''bacteriophage''' (from '[[bacteria]]' and [[Greek language|Greek]] φᾰγεῖν ''phagein'' &quot;to eat&quot;) is any one of a number of [[viruses]] that [[infection|infect]] bacteria. Bacteriophages are among the most common biological entities on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Collman, J. P. 2001. ''Naturally Dangerous: Surprising facts about food, health, and the Environment.'' Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. Pg. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in its shortened form, ''phage''.

Typically, bacteriophages consist of an outer [[protein]] [[capsid]] enclosing [[genetic material]]. The genetic material can be [[ssRNA]], [[dsRNA]], [[ssDNA]], or [[DNA|dsDNA]] ('ss-' or 'ds-' prefix denotes single-strand or double-strand) along with either circular or linear arrangement. 

Phages are estimated to be the most widely distributed and diverse entities in the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Mc Grath S and van Sinderen D (editors). | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/phage ISBN 978-1-904455-14-1 ]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phages are ubiquitous and can be found in all reservoirs populated by [[bacteria]]l hosts, such as soil or the intestines of animals. One of the densest natural sources for phages and other viruses is sea water, where up to 9×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[virus|virions]] per milliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1128/MMBR.64.1.69-114.2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prescott&quot;&gt;Prescott, L. (1993). Microbiology, Wm. C. Brown Publishers, ISBN 0-697-01372-3&lt;/ref&gt;
They have been used for over 60 years as an alternative to antibiotics in the former [[Soviet Union]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;horizon&quot;&gt;BBC Horizon (1997): ''The Virus that Cures'' – Documentary about the history of phage medicine in Russia and the West&lt;/ref&gt; They are seen as a possible therapy against [[multi drug resistant]] strains of many bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-13005739 BBC article: The drugs don't work - so what will? (8 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The dsDNA tailed phages, or ''Caudovirales'', account for 95% of all the phages reported in the scientific literature, and possibly make up the majority of phages on the planet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | author = Mc Grath S and van Sinderen D (editors). | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology  | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/phage ISBN 978-1-904455-14-1 ]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other phages that occur abundantly in the biosphere, phages with different virions, genomes and lifestyles. Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to morphology and nucleic acid.

==History==
Since ancient times, there have been documented reports of river waters having the ability to cure infectious diseases&lt;!--or &quot;...documented reports of the ability of river water to cure infectious diseases,&quot; but illogical in original form--&gt;, such as [[leprosy]]. In 1896, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]] reported that something in the waters of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in [[India]] had marked [[antibacterial]] action against [[cholera]] and could pass through a very fine porcelain filter. In 1915, [[United Kingdom|British]] [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]], superintendent of the Brown Institution of London, discovered a small agent that infected and killed bacteria. He believed that the agent must be one of the following:
# a stage in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the bacteria;
# an [[enzyme]] produced by the bacteria themselves; or
# a virus that grew on and destroyed the bacteria.

Twort's work was interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]] and shortage of funding.

Independently, [[French-Canadian]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Félix d'Hérelle]], working at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]], announced on September 3, 1917, that he had discovered &quot;an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the [[dysentery]] bacillus&quot;. For d’Hérelle, there was no question as to the nature of his discovery: &quot;In a flash I had understood: what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe ... a virus parasitic on bacteria.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herelle1917&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In 1923, the [[George Eliava Institute|Eliava Institute]] was opened in [[Tbilisi, Georgia]], to research this new science and put it into practice.

In 1969 [[Delbrück, Max Ludwig Henning|Max Delbrück]], [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Luria, S. E.|Salvador Luria]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine]] for their discoveries of the replication of viruses and their genetic structure.

==Replication==
Bacteriophages may have a [[lytic cycle]] or a [[lysogenic cycle]], and a few viruses are capable of carrying out both. With '''lytic phages''' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the new phages can find new hosts. Lytic phages are the kind suitable for [[phage therapy]].

In contrast, the '''lysogenic cycle''' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as ''[[temperate phage]]s''. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it fairly harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients, then the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is reproduced in all of the cell’s offspring.

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial [[genome]] in a phenomenon called [[lysogenic conversion]]. An eminent example is the conversion of a harmless strain of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' by a phage into a highly virulent one, which causes [[cholera]]. This is why temperate phages are not suitable for phage therapy.

===Attachment and penetration ===

[[Image:Phage.jpg|thumb|An [[electron micrograph]] of bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell. These viruses are the size and shape of coliphage T1]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Trialphage.jpg|thumb|A 3D rendering of a T4 type bacteriophage landing on a bacterium to inject genetic material]] --&gt;
To enter a host cell, bacteriophages attach to specific receptors on the surface of bacteria, including [[lipopolysaccharide]]s, [[teichoic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, or even [[flagella]]. This specificity means that a bacteriophage can only infect certain bacteria bearing receptors to which they can bind, which in turn determines the phage's host range. Host growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9356254&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1006/jmbi.1997.1353}}&lt;/ref&gt; As phage virions do not move independently, they must rely on random encounters with the right receptors when in solution (blood, lymphatic circulation, irrigation, soil water, etc.).

[[Virus#Morphology|Complex]] bacteriophages use a [[hypodermic syringe]]-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After making contact with the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell. Once attached completely, the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] present in the tail,&lt;ref name=&quot;Prescott&quot;/&gt; injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane.

=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===
Within minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so that it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host’s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins which help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]]. [[Walter Fiers]] ([[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]]) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of [[Bacteriophage MS2]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1038/260500a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virion assembly===
In the case of the [[T4 phage]], the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterwards. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
[[Image:Tevenphage.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a typical tailed bacteriophage structure]]

===Release of virions===
Phages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain [[Mycoplasma]] phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].

==Phage therapy==
{{Main|Phage therapy}}

Phages were discovered to be anti-bacterial agents, but the medical trials performed in western countries were sub-standard to the point of not being scientifically viable; this was because the early tests were conducted poorly and without an idea of what a phage was. Phage therapy was shortly thereafter ruled out as untrustworthy much because many of the trials were conducted on totally unrelated diseases such as allergies and viral infections. [[Antibiotic]]s were discovered some years later and marketed widely, popular because of their broad spectrum and easier to manufacture in bulk, store, and prescribe. Hence development of phage therapy was largely abandoned in the [[West]], but  continued throughout 1940s in the [[Soviet Union]] for treating bacterial infections, with widespread use including the soldiers in the Red Army&amp;mdash;much of the literature was published in Russian or Georgian, and unavailable for many years in the West. Their use has continued since the end of the Cold War in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]  and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. A monograph written by Nina Chanishvili ''&quot;A Literature Review of the Practical Application of Bacteriophage Research&quot;'' was published in 2009, in Tbilisi, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Chanishvili (2009) &quot;A Literature Review of the Practical Application of Bacteriophage Research&quot;, p184&lt;/ref&gt; The monograph gives the most thorough analysis of the results on phage therapy according to the data given in the old Soviet scientific literature. 

The first regulated clinical trial of efficacy in Western Europe (against ear infections caused by ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'') was reported in the journal ''Clinical Otolaryngology'' in August 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1749-4486.2009.01973.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Western scientists are developing engineered viruses to overcome antibiotic resistance, and experimenting with tumor-suppressing agents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.  One potential treatment currently under development is a phage designed to destroy [[MRSA]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/349461/british_biotech_boasts_antibiotic_breakthrough/?fp=4194304&amp;fpid=1 British biotech boasts antibiotic breakthrough - Biotechnology, bacteriophages, bacteria - Australian Life Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the environment==
{{Main|Marine bacteriophage}}
[[Metagenomics]] has allowed the detection of bacteriophages in water that was not possible previously. These investigations revealed that phage are much more abundant in the water column of both freshwater and marine habitats than previously thought&lt;ref&gt;{{Breitbart, M, P Salamon, B Andresen, J Mahaffy, A Segall, D Mead, F Azam, F Rohwer (2002) Genomic analysis of uncultured marine viral communities. Proceedings of the National Academy USA. 99:14250-14255.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they can cause significant mortality of [[bacterioplankton]]. Methods in phage community ecology have been developed to assess phage-induced mortality of bacterioplankton and its role for food web process and [[biogeochemical]] cycle to genetically fingerprint phage communities or populations and estimate viral [[biodiversity]] by metagenomics. The [[lysis]] of bacteria by phages releases organic carbon that was previously particulate (cells) into dissolved forms, which makes the carbon more available to other organisms. Phages are not only the most abundant biological entities but probably also the most diverse ones. The majority of the sequence data obtained from phage communities has no equivalent in databases. These data and other detailed analyses indicate that phage-specific genes and ecological traits are much more frequent than previously thought. In order to reveal the meaning of this genetic and ecological versatility, studies have to be performed with communities and at [[spatiotemporal]] scales relevant for microorganisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Bacteriophages have also been used in [[hydrology|hydrological]] tracing and modelling in [[river]] systems especially where surface water and [[groundwater]] interactions occur. The use of phages is preferred to the more conventional [[dye]] marker because they are significantly less absorbed when passing through ground-waters and they are readily detected at very low concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1747-6593.1988.tb01352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in food fermentation==
A broad number of food products, commodity chemicals, and [[biotechnology]] products are manufactured industrially by large-scale bacterial [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] of various organic substrates. Because enormous amounts of bacteria are being cultivated each day in large fermentation vats, the risk of bacteriophage [[contamination]] could rapidly bring fermentation to a halt. The resulting economical setback is a serious threat in these industries. The relationship between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts is very important in the context of the food fermentation industry. Sources of phage contamination, measures to control their [[self-replication|propagation]] and [[dissemination]], and biotechnological defense strategies developed to restrain phages are of interest. The dairy fermentation industry has openly acknowledged the problem of phage and has been working with academia and starter culture companies to develop defense strategies and systems to curtail the propagation and evolution of phages for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==Other areas of use==
In August, 2006 the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved using bacteriophages on cheese to kill the ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' bacteria, giving them GRAS status (Generally Recognized As Safe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~rdb/opa-g198.html U.S. FDA/CFSAN: Agency Response Letter: GRAS Notice No. GRN 000198&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the same bacteriophages were approved for use on all food products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~rdb/opa-g218.html U.S. FDA/CFSAN: Agency Response Letter: GRAS Notice No. GRN 000218]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government agencies in the West have for several years been looking to Georgia and the Former Soviet Union for help with exploiting phages for counteracting bioweapons and toxins, such as [[anthrax]] and [[botulism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/americas/25iht-institute.4.5869943.html The New York Times: Studying anthrax in a Soviet-era lab - with Western funding]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many developments with this amongst research groups in the US.  Other uses include spray application in horticulture for protecting plants and vegetable produce from decay and the spread of bacterial disease. Other applications for bacteriophages are as a biocide for environmental surfaces, e.g., in hospitals, and as a preventative treatment for catheters and medical devices prior to use in clinical settings. The technology now exists for phages to be applied to dry surfaces, e.g., uniforms, curtains, even sutures for surgery. Clinical trials reported in the Lancet&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; show success in veterinary treatment of pet dogs with otitis.

[[Phage display]] is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage's genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name), providing a link between the peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library can be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g. Botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound selected phages can be multiplied by re-infecting a susceptible bacterial strain, thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.

The [[Sensing of phage-triggered ion cascades (SEPTIC) | SEPTIC ]] bacterium sensing and identification method utilizes the ion emission and its dynamics during phage infection and offers high specificity and speed for detection.

A '''bacteriostat''' is a biological or chemical agent that causes [[bacteriostasis]]. It stops [[bacteria]] from reproducing, while not necessarily harming them otherwise. Upon removal of the bacteriostat, the bacteria usually start to grow again. Bacteriostats are often used in [[plastic]]s to prevent growth of bacteria on the plastic surface.  This is in contrast to [[bactericide|bacteriocides]], which kill bacteria.

Bacteriostats commonly used in laboratory work include [[sodium azide]] and [[thimerosol]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
A '''bactericide''' or '''bacteriocide''' is a substance that kills [[bacteria]] and, ideally, nothing else. Bactericides are [[disinfectant]]s, [[antiseptic]]s or [[antibiotic]]s.

==Bactericidal disinfectants==
The most used  [[disinfectant]]s are those applying
*active [[chlorine]] (i.e., [[hypochlorite]]s, [[chloramine]]s, [[dichloroisocyanurate]] and [[trichloroisocyanurate]], wet chlorine, [[chlorine dioxide]] etc.),
*active [[oxygen]] ([[peroxide]]s, such as [[peracetic acid]], potassium persulfate, sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate and urea perhydrate),
*[[iodine]] ([[iodpovidone]] (povidone-iodine, Betadine), [[Lugol's solution]], iodine tincture, iodinated nonionic surfactants),
*concentrated [[alcohols]] (mainly [[ethanol]], [[1-propanol]], called also [[n-propanol]] and [[2-propanol]], called [[isopropanol]] and mixtures thereof; further, [[2-phenoxyethanol]] and 1- and [[2-phenoxypropanol]]s are used),
*[[phenols|phenolic substances]] (such as [[phenol]] (also called &quot;carbolic acid&quot;), [[cresol]]s (called &quot;Lysole&quot; in combination with liquid potassium soaps), halogenated (chlorinated, brominated) phenols, such as [[hexachlorophene]], [[triclosan]], [[trichlorophenol]], [[tribromophenol]], [[pentachlorophenol]], Dibromol and salts thereof),
*[[cationic surfactants]], such as some [[quaternary ammonium cations]] (such as [[benzalkonium chloride]], [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] or chloride, [[didecyldimethylammonium chloride]], [[cetylpyridinium chloride]], [[benzethonium chloride]]) and others, non-quaternary compounds, such as [[chlorhexidine]], [[glucoprotamine]], [[octenidine]] dihydrochloride etc.),
*strong [[oxidizer]]s, such as [[ozone]] and [[permanganate]] solutions;
*[[heavy metals]] and their salts, such as colloidal [[silver]], [[silver nitrate]], [[mercury chloride]], [[organomercury|phenylmercury]] salts, [[copper sulfate]], [[copper oxide-chloride]] etc. Heavy metals and their salts are the most toxic and environment-hazardous bactericides and therefore their use is strongly oppressed or canceled 
*properly concentrated strong [[acid]]s (phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, amidosulfuric, toluenesulfonic acids) and
*[[alkali]]s (sodium, potassium, calcium hydroxides), such as of pH &lt; 1 or &gt; 13, particularly under elevated temperature (above 60°C), kills bacteria.

==Bactericidal antiseptics==
As [[antiseptic]]s (i.e., germicide agents that can be used on human or animal body, skin, mucoses, wounds and the like), few of the above mentioned disinfectants can be used, under proper conditions (mainly concentration, pH, temperature and toxicity toward humans and animals). Among them, some important are
*properly diluted [[chlorine]] preparations (f.e. [[Daquin's solution]], 0.5% sodium or potassium hypochlorite solution, pH-adjusted to pH 7 – 8, or 0.5 – 1% solution of sodium benzenesulfochloramide ([[chloramine]] B)), some
*[[iodine]] preparations, such as [[iodophor|iodopovidone]] in various [[galenic]]s (ointment, solutions, wound plasters), in the past also [[Lugol's solution]],
*[[peroxides]] as urea perhydrate solutions and pH-[[Buffer solution|buffered]] 0.1 – 0.25% peracetic acid solutions,
*[[alcohol]]s with or without antiseptic additives, used mainly for skin antisepsis,
* weak [[organic acids]] such as [[sorbic acid]], [[benzoic acid]], [[lactic acid]] and [[salicylic acid]]
*some [[phenol]]ic compounds, such as [[hexachlorophene]], [[triclosan]] and Dibromol, and
*[[cation-active compounds]], such as 0.05 – 0.5% benzalkonium, 0.5 – 4% chlorhexidine, 0.1 – 2% octenidine solutions.
Others are generally not applicable as safe antiseptics, either because of their [[corrosive]] or [[toxic]] nature.

==Bactericidal antibiotics==
Bactericidal [[antibiotic]]s kill bacteria; [[bacteriostatic]] antibiotics slow their growth or reproduction.

Antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis: the [[Beta-lactam antibiotics]] ([[penicillin]] derivatives ([[penam]]s), [[cephalosporin]]s ([[cephem]]s), [[monobactam]]s, and [[carbapenem]]s) and [[vancomycin]].

Also bactericidal are [[daptomycin]], [[fluoroquinolone]]s, [[metronidazole]], [[nitrofurantoin]], [[co-trimoxazole]], telithromycin.

[[Aminoglycoside|Aminoglycosidic antibiotics]]  are usually considered bactericidal, although they may be bacteriostatic with some organisms

He is best known for his (re)discovery of the [[cut-up technique]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristan Tzara]] pulling words at random from a hat to create a poem during a Surrealist rally in the 1920s had already created something similar.&lt;/ref&gt; used by his friend, the novelist [[William S. Burroughs]]. 
With the engineer [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]] he invented the [[Dreamachine]], a flicker device designed as an art object to be viewed with the eyes closed. It was in painting and drawing, however, that Gysin devoted his greatest efforts, creating [[calligraphic]] works inspired by the cursive [[Japanese calligraphy|Japanese &quot;grass&quot; script]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic writing]]. Burroughs later stated that &quot;Brion Gysin was the only man I ever respected.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, William. ''Introduction''.

== Biography ==
===Early years===
John Clifford Brian Gysin was born at Taplow House, England, a Canadian military hospital. His mother, Stella Margaret Martin, was a Canadian from [[Deseronto, Ontario]]. His father, Leonard Gysin, a captain with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], was killed in action eight months after his son's birth. Stella returned to Canada and settled in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] where her son became &quot;the only Catholic day-boy at an Anglican boarding school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. John Geiger's biographical essay on Gysin titled, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', ed. José Férez Kuri (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2003), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating at fifteen, Gysin was sent to [[Downside School]] in [[Stratton-on-the-Fosse]], near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]] in England, a prestigious college known as &quot;the Eton of Catholic public schools&quot; run by the Benedictines.

===Surrealism===
In 1934, he moved to Paris to study ''La Civilisation Française'', an open course given at the [[Sorbonne]] where he made literary and artistic contacts through Marie Berthe Aurenche, [[Max Ernst]]'s second wife.&lt;ref name = &quot;fmmdmv&quot;&gt;Cf. John Geiger, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Surrealist Group and began frequenting [[Valentine Hugo]], [[Leonor Fini]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Picasso]] and [[Dora Maar]]. A year later, he had his first exhibition at the ''Galerie Quatre Chemins'' in Paris with Ernst, Picasso, [[Hans Arp]], [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], Dalí, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[René Magritte]], [[Man Ray]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. On the day of the preview, however, he was expelled from the Surrealist Group by [[André Breton]] who ordered the poet [[Paul Éluard]] to take down his pictures. Gysin was 19 years old. His biographer, John Geiger, suggests the arbitrary expulsion &quot;had the effect of a curse. Years later, he blamed other failures on the Breton incident. It gave rise to conspiracy theories about the powerful interests who seek control of the art world. He gave various explanations for the expulsion, the more elaborate involving 'insubordination' or ''lèse majesté'' towards Breton&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;fmmdmv&quot;/&gt;

===After World War II===
After serving in the U.S. army during World War II, Gysin published a biography of [[Josiah Henson|Josiah &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; Henson]] titled, ''To Master, a Long Goodnight: The History of Slavery in Canada'' (1946). A gifted draughtsman, he took an 18-month course learning the Japanese language (including calligraphy) that would greatly influence his artwork. In 1949, he was among the first [[Fulbright Fellow]]s. His goal: to research the history of slavery at the University of Bordeaux and in the [[Archivo de Indias]] in Seville, Spain, a project that he later abandoned. He moved to [[Tangier]], Morocco after visiting the city with novelist and composer [[Paul Bowles]] in 1950.

===Morocco and the Beat Hotel===
In 1954 in Tangier, Gysin opened a restaurant called &quot;The 1001 Nights&quot;, with his friend [[Mohamed Hamri]], who was the cook. Gysin hired the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]] from the village of Jajouka to perform alongside entertainment that included acrobats, a dancing boy and fire eaters.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Michelle, ''The Dream at the End of the World'', (New York, 1991), p.123, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, John, ''Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted: the Life of Brion Gysin'', (New York, 2005), p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The musicians performed there for an international clientele that included William S. Burroughs. Losing the business in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;In his seminal essay 'Cut-Ups: A Project for Disastrous Success', Gysin explains that &quot;on January 5, 1958, I lost the business over a signature given to a friendly American couple who 'wanted to help me out.' I was out with the shirt on my back.&quot; From ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; and the restaurant closed permanently. In 1958, Gysin returned to live in Paris, taking lodgings in a flophouse located at 9 rue Gît-le-Coeur that would become famous as the [[Beat Hotel]]. Working on a drawing, he discovered a [[Dada]] technique by accident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
William Burroughs and I first went into techniques of writing, together, back in room No. 15 of the Beat Hotel during the cold Paris spring of 1958... Burroughs was more intent on Scotch-taping his photos together into one great continuum on the wall, where scenes faded and slipped into one another, than occupied with editing the monster manuscript... [[Naked Lunch]] appeared and Burroughs disappeared. He kicked his habit with apomorphine and flew off to London to see Dr Dent, who had first turned him on to the cure. While cutting a mount for a drawing in room No. 15, I sliced through a pile of newspapers with my [[Stanley knife|Stanley blade]] and thought of what I had said to Burroughs some six months earlier about the necessity for turning painters' techniques directly into writing. I picked up the raw words and began to piece together texts that later appeared as &quot;First Cut-Ups&quot; in  ''Minutes to Go'' (Two Cities, Paris 1960).&lt;ref&gt;Brion Gysin: ''Cut-Ups: A Project for Disastrous Success'', published in ''Evergreen Review'' and much later in ''[Brion Gysin] Let the Mice In'', Something Else Press, West Clover 1973; also in the ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', John Calder (editor), Picador, London 1982, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Burroughs returned from London in September 1959, Gysin not only shared his discovery with his friend but the new techniques he had developed for it. Burroughs then put the techniques to use while completing ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' and the experiment dramatically changed the landscape of [[American literature]]. Gysin helped Burroughs with the editing of several of his novels including [[Interzone]], and wrote a script for a film version of ''Naked Lunch'' which was never produced. The pair collaborated on a large manuscript for [[Grove Press]] titled ''[[The Third Mind]]'' but it was determined that it would be impractical to publish it as originally envisioned. The book later published under that title incorporates little of this material. Interviewed for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1997, Burroughs explained that Gysin was &quot;the only man that I've ever respected in my life. I've admired people, I've liked them, but he's the only man I've ever respected.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Gysin completed his finest novel, ''[[The Process (novel)|The Process]]'', a work judged by critic Robert Palmer as &quot;a classic of 20th century modernism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;From Palmer's forward to the novel published by The Overlook Press in 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

A consummate innovator, Gysin altered the cut-up technique to produce what he called permutation poems in which a single phrase was repeated several times with the words rearranged in a different order with each reiteration. An example of this is &quot;I don't dig work, man/Man, work I don't dig.&quot;  Many of these permutations were derived using a random sequence generator in an early computer program written by [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]]. Commissioned by the [[BBC]] in 1960 to produce material for broadcast, Gysin's results included &quot;Pistol Poem&quot;, which was created by recording a gun firing at different distances and then splicing the sounds. That year, the piece was subsequently used as a theme for the Paris performance of [[Le Domaine Poetique]], a showcase for experimental works by people like Gysin, [[François Dufrêne]], [[Bernard Heidsieck]], and [[Henri Chopin]]. 

With Sommerville, he built the [[Dreamachine]] in 1961. Described as &quot;the first art object to be seen with the eyes closed&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on coverflap of ''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age''.&lt;/ref&gt; the flicker device uses [[alpha waves]] in the 8-16 [[Hertz|Hz]] range to produce a change of consciousness in receptive viewers.

===Later years===
He also worked extensively with noted [[jazz]] soprano saxophonist [[Steve Lacy]].

He recorded an album in 1986 with French musician Ramuntcho Matta, featuring himself singing/rapping his own texts, with performances by [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Elli Medeiros]], [[Steve Lacy]], [[Lizzy Mercier Descloux]] and more. The album was reissued on CD in 1993 by [[Crammed Discs]], under the title ''Self-Portrait Jumping''. 

As a joke, Gysin contributed a recipe for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] fudge to a cookbook by [[Alice B. Toklas]]; it was unintentionally included for publication, becoming famous under the name [[Alice B. Toklas brownie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Biographer John Geiger writes that Gysin's restaurant, ''The 1001 Nights'' provided him &quot;with an entrée into Tangiers society. His Moroccan culinary delights even merited an entry in Alice B. Toklas's famous cookbook, with a recipe for hashish fudge. Toklas, however, had no idea what the mysterious ingredient - cannabis - was, protesting later 'of course I didn't know the Latin name'.&quot; Cf. John Geiger, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

A heavily edited version of his novel, ''The Last Museum'', was published posthumously in 1986 by [[Faber &amp; Faber]] (London) and by [[Grove Press]] (New York).

Made an American Commander of the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 1985, Gysin died a year later of [[lung cancer]] on July 13, 1986. An obituary by Robert Palmer published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' fittingly described him as a man who &quot;threw off the sort of ideas that ordinary artists would parlay into a lifetime career, great clumps of ideas, as casually as a locomotive throws off sparks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. John Geiger, 'Brion Gysin: His Life and Times' in ''Brion Gysin: Tuning into the Multimedia Age'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Burroughs on the Gysin cut-up  ==
In a 1966 interview by Conrad Knickerbocker for [[The Paris Review]], William S. Burroughs explained that Brion Gysin was, to his knowledge, &quot;the first to create cut-ups&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
INTERVIEWER: How did you become interested in the cut-up technique?

BURROUGHS: A friend, Brion Gysin, an American poet and painter, who has lived in Europe for thirty years, was, as far as I know, the first to create cut-ups. His cut-up poem, ''Minutes to Go'', was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of ''Naked Lunch''. I became interested in the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' was the first great cut-up collage, and Tristan Tzara had done a bit along the same lines. [[Dos Passos]] used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in ''[[U.S.A. trilogy|USA]]''. I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done.&lt;ref&gt;Knickerbocker, Conrad, Burroughs, Williams S., 'The Paris Review Interview with William S. Burroughs' in ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
According to José Férez Kuri, author of ''Brion Gysin: Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'' (2003) and co-curator of a major retrospective of the artist's work at The Edmonton Art Gallery in 1998, Gysin's wide range of &quot;radical ideas would become a source of inspiration for artists of the [[Beat Generation]], as well as for their successors (among them [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Haring]], and [[Laurie Anderson]])&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kuri, ''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', coverflap.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists include [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], and [[Into A Circle]]{{Citation needed|date= December 2010}}.

*: &quot;The Way Is Nor This Nor That.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

*: &quot;Writers don't own their words. Since when do words belong to anybody? 'Your very own words,' indeed! And who are you?&quot;
::- 'Cut-Ups Self-Explained' in ''Brion Gysin Let the Mice In'' &lt;ref&gt;''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

*: &quot;I may write only what I know in space: I am that I am.&quot;
::- ''Notes on Painting'' &lt;ref&gt;''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

*: &quot;He covered tons of paper with his words and made them his very own words... he branded them like cattle he rustled out there on the free ranges of Literature... Used by another writer who was attempting cut-ups, one single word of Burroughs vocabulary could ruin a whole barrel of good everyday words, run the literary rot right through them. One sniff of that prose and you'd say, 'Why, that's a Burroughs.' &quot;
::- on the prose of William S. Burroughs in ''Here to Go: Planet R-101'' (Interviews with Terry Wilson) &lt;ref&gt;''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

*: &quot;Of course the sands of Present Time are running out from under our feet. And why not? The Great Conundrum: 'What are we here for?' is all that ever held us here in the first place. Fear. The answer to the Riddle of the Ages has actually been out in the street since the First Step in Space. Who runs may read but few people run fast enough. What are we here for? Does the great metaphysical nut revolve around that? Well, I'll crack it for you, right now. What are we here for? We are here to go!&quot;
::- ''The Process'' &lt;ref&gt;''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

*: &quot;Language is an abominable misunderstanding which makes up a part of matter. The painters and the physicists have treated matter pretty well. The poets have hardly touched it. In March 1958, when I was living at the Beat Hotel, I proposed to Burroughs to at least make available to literature the means that painters have been using for fifty years. Cut words into pieces and scramble them. You'll hear someone draw a bow-string. Who runs may read, To read better, practice your running. Speed is entirely up to us, since machines have delivered us from the horse. Henceforth the question is to deliver us from that other so-called superior animal, man. It's not worth it to chase out the merchants: their temple is dedicated to the unsuitable lie of the value of the Unique. The crime of separation gave birth to the idea of the Unique which would not be separate. In painting, matter has seen everything: from sand to stuffed goats. Disfigured more and more, the image has been geometrically multiplied to a dizzying degree. A snow of advertising could fall from the sky, and only collector babies and the chimpanzees who make abstract paintings would bother to pick one up.&quot;
::- ''Cut-Ups: A Project for Disastrous Success''

*: &quot;I Am the Artist when I am Open. When I am closed I am Brion Gysin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mycobacterium bovis BCG ZN.jpg|thumb|250px|Microscopic image of the Calmette-Guérin bacillus, [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]],  magnification:1,000]]
'''Bacillus Calmette-Guérin''' (or '''Bacille Calmette-Guérin''', '''BCG''') is a [[vaccine]] against [[tuberculosis]] that is prepared from a strain of the attenuated (weakened) live bovine tuberculosis bacillus, ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]'', that has lost its virulence in humans by being specially subcultured (230 passages) in an artificial medium for 13 years. The bacilli have retained enough strong antigenicity to become a somewhat effective [[vaccine]] for the prevention of human tuberculosis. At best, the BCG vaccine is 80% effective in preventing tuberculosis for a duration of 15 years; however, its protective effect appears to vary according to geography.

==History==
The history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  After the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, scientists thought to find a corollary in [[tuberculosis]] by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  It was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.

[[Image:LouisPasteurMonumentLille.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Institut Pasteur de Lille]]]]
[[Albert Calmette]], a French bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Guérin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tubercle bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  They transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fine PEM, Carneiro IAM, Milstein JB, Clements CJ. | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[Lübeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, and led to legal action being taken against the manufacturers of BCG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Litte, Brown &amp; Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], working at the Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]).  Because of opposition, however, it did not become widely used until after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted increase of TB after a major war. 

BCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. The USA and the Netherlands have never used it routinely. In both countries, BCG vaccination is not routinely given to adults because it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a relatively rare (in those countries) condition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Recent research by the [[Imperial College London]] has focused on finding new cellwall proteins which trigger an immune response and are suitable for use in a vaccine that can provide long-term protection against ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. The study has revealed a few such proteins, the most promising of which has been dubbed EspC, elicits a very strong immune reaction, and is specific to ''M. tuberculosis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12789022 | work=BBC News | title=Tuberculosis vaccine target found | date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variable efficacy==
The most controversial aspect of BCG is the variable efficacy found in different clinical trials that appears to depend on geography.  Trials conducted in the UK have consistently shown a protective effect of 60 to 80%, but those conducted elsewhere have shown no protective effect, and efficacy appears to fall the closer one gets to the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Colditz GA, Brewer TF, Berkey CS | title=Efficacy of BCG Vaccine in the Prevention of Tuberculosis | journal=J Am Med Assoc | year=1994 | volume=271 | pages=698&amp;ndash;702 | doi=10.1001/jama.271.9.698 | pmid=8309034 | issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fine PEM|title=Variation in protection by BCG: implications of and for heterologous immunity|journal=Lancet|year=1995|volume=346|issue=8986|pages=1339&amp;ndash;1345|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)92348-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large scale trial evaluating the efficacy of BCG was conducted from 1956 to 1963, and involved 54,239 school children who received BCG at the age of 14 or 15; this study showed an efficacy of 84% up to 5 years after immunization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hart PD, Sutherland I. | title=BCG and vole bacillus vaccines in the prevention of tuberculosis in adolescence and early adult life. Final Report of the Medical Research Council | journal=Brit Med J | year=1977 | volume=2 | issue=6082 | pages=293&amp;ndash;95 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6082.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a US Public Health Service trial of BCG in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] published in 1966 showed an efficacy of only 14%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Comstock GW, Palmer CE. | title=Long-term results of BCG in the southern United States | journal=Am Rev Resp Dis | year=1966 | volume=93 | issue=2 | pages=171&amp;ndash;83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did much to convince the US it did not want to implement mass immunization with BCG.  A further trial conducted in South India and published in 1979 (the &quot;Chingleput trial&quot;), showed no protective effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Tuberculosis Prevention Trial | title=Trial of BCG vaccines in south India for tuberculosis prevention | journal=Indian J Med Res | year=1979 | volume=70 | pages=349&amp;ndash;63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duration of protection of BCG is not clearly known.  In those studies showing a protective effect, the data are inconsistent.  The MRC study showed protection waned to 59% after 15 years and to zero after 20 years; however, a study looking at native Americans immunized in the 1930s found evidence of protection even 60 years after immunization, with only a slight waning in efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Aronson NE, Santosham M, Comstock GW | title=Long-term efficacy of BCG vaccine in American Indians and Alaska Natives: A 60-year follow-up study | journal=JAMA | year=2004 | volume=291 | issue=17 | pages=2086&amp;ndash;91 | pmid=15126436 | doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCG seems to have its greatest effect in preventing miliary TB or TB meningitis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rodrigues LC, Diwan VK, Wheeler JG | title=Protective Effect of BCG against Tuberculous Meningitis and Miliary Tuberculosis: A Meta-Analysis | journal=Int J Epidemiol | year=1993 | volume=22 | pages=1154&amp;ndash;58 | doi=10.1093/ije/22.6.1154 | pmid=8144299 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which reason, it is still extensively used even in countries where efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis is negligible.

===Reasons for variable efficacy===
The reasons for the variable efficacy of BCG in different countries are difficult to understand.  A number of possible reasons have been proposed, but none have been proven, and none can explain the lack of efficacy in both low TB burden countries (US) and high TB burden countries (India).
#'''Background frequency of exposure to tuberculosis'''  It has been hypothesized that in areas with high levels of background exposure to tuberculosis, every susceptible individual is already exposed prior to BCG, and that the natural immunizing effect of background tuberculosis duplicates any benefit of BCG. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}
#'''Genetic variation in BCG strains'''  There is genetic variation in the BCG strains used, and this may explain the variable efficacy reported in different trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brosch R, Gordon SV, Garnier T, Eiglmeier K | title=Genome plasticity of BCG and impact on vaccine efficacy | year=2007 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci | doi=10.1073/pnas.0700869104 | volume=104 | pages=5596 | pmid=17372194 | issue=13 | pmc=1838518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Genetic variation in populations'''  Differences in genetic make-up of different populations may explain the difference in efficacy.  The Birmingham BCG trial was published in 1988.  The trial was based in [[Birmingham]], United Kingdom, and examined children born to families who originated from the Indian subcontinent (where vaccine efficacy had previously been shown to be zero).  The trial showed a 64% protective effect, which is very similar to the figure derived from other UK trials, thus refuting the genetic variation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Packe GE, Innes JA. | title=Protective effect of BCG vaccination in infant Asians: a case-control study | volume=63 | pages=277&amp;ndash;281 | year=1988 | url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/archdischild%3b63/3/277 | pmid=3258499 | doi=10.1136/adc.63.3.277 | journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood | issue=3 | pmc=1778792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Interference by nontuberculous mycobacteria''' Exposure to environmental mycobacteria (especially ''M. avium'', ''M. marinum'' and ''M. intracellulare'') results in a nonspecific immune response against mycobacteria.  Administering BCG to someone who already has a nonspecific immune response against mycobacteria does not augment the response already there.  BCG will therefore appear not to be efficacious, ''because'' that person already has a level of immunity and BCG is not adding to that immunity.  This effect is called '''masking''', because the effect of BCG is masked by environmental mycobacteria.  There is clinical evidence for this effect from a series of studies performed in parallel in adolescent school children in the UK and Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Black GF, Weir RE, Floyd S | title=BCG-induced increase in interferon-gamma response to mycobacterial antigens and efficacy of BCG vaccination in Malai and the UK: two randomized controlled studies | journal=Lancet | volume=359 | issue=9315 | pages=1393&amp;ndash;401 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08353-8 | year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this study, the UK school children had a low baseline cellular immunity to mycobacteria which was increased by BCG; in contrast, the Malawi school children had a high baseline cellular immunity to mycobacteria and this was not significantly increased by BCG.  Whether this natural immune response is protective is not known.  This hypothesis was first made by Palmer and Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | unused_data=Palmer CE, Long MW. | title=Effects of infection with atypical mycobacteria on BCG vaccination and tuberculosis | journal=Am Rev Respir Dis | year=1966 | pages=553&amp;ndash;68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative explanation is suggested by mouse studies: immunity against mycobacteria stops BCG from replicating and so stops it from producing an immune response.  This is called the '''blocking''' hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brandt L, Feino Cunha J, Weinreich Olsen A | title=Failure of ''Mycobacterium bovis'' BCG vaccine: some species of environmental mycobacteria block multiplication of BCG and induction of protective immunity to tuberculosis | journal=Infect Immun | year=2002 | volume=70 | pages=672&amp;ndash;78 | doi=10.1128/IAI.70.2.672-678.2002 | pmid=11796598 | issue=2 | pmc=127715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Interference by concurrent parasitic infection''' Another hypothesis is that simultaneous infection with parasites changes the immune response to BCG, making it less effective.  A [[T helper cell|Th1]] response is required for an effective immune response to tuberculous infection; one hypothesis is that concurrent infection with various parasites produces a simultaneous Th2-response which blunts the effect of BCG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rook GAW|author2=Dheda K|author3=Zumla A.|authorlink3=Alimuddin Zumla | title=Do successful tuberculosis vaccines need to be immunoregulatory rather than merely Th1-boosting? | journal=Vaccine | volume=23 | issue=17&amp;ndash;18 | year=2005 | pages=2115&amp;ndash;20 | doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.01.069 | pmid=15755581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Exposure to Ultraviolet Light''' Concentration of ultraviolet light (particularly [[UVB]] light) from the [[Sun]] may have some effect on efficacy of the BCG vaccine.  UVB has been demonstrated to reduce efficacy of BCG vaccine in laboratory guinea pigs. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuberculosisjournal.com/article/S1472-9792%2809%2900086-9/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration gradient of UVB light increases geographically closer to the Earth's equator.  It is possible, though currently unresearched, that this effect may occur as a result of sunlight-dependent [[Vitamin D]] production.

==Uses==
'''Tuberculosis''' The main use of BCG is for vaccination against tuberculosis. It is recommended the BCG vaccination be given intradermally by a nurse skilled in the technique. Having had a previous BCG vaccination is a cause of a [[false positive]] [[Mantoux test]], although a very high-grade reading is usually due to active disease. 

The age of the patient and the frequency with which BCG is given has always varied from country to country.

*'''WHO BCG policy''' The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] recommend BCG be given to all children born in countries highly endemic for TB because it protects against miliary TB and TB meningitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=WHO | title=WHO Position Paper on BCG Vaccination | publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | year=2004 | location=Geneva | url=http://www.who.int/immunization/wer7904BCG_Jan04_position_paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''United States''' The US has never used mass immunization of BCG, relying instead on the detection and treatment of [[latent tuberculosis]].
*'''United Kingdom''' The UK introduced universal BCG immunization in 1953, and until 2005, the UK policy was to immunize all school children at the age of 13, and all neonates born into high risk groups.  BCG was also given to protect people who had been exposed to tuberculosis.  The peak of tuberculosis incidence is in adolescence and early adulthood, and the evidence from the MRC trial was that efficacy lasted only 15 years at most.  Styblo and Meijer argued neonatal immunization protected against miliary TB and other noncontagious forms of TB, and not pulmonary TB which was a disease of adults, and that mass immunization campaigns with BCG would therefore not be expected to have a significant public health impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Styblo K, Meijer J. | title=Impact of BCG vaccination programs in children and young adults on the tuberculosis problem | journal=Tubercle | year=1976 | volume=57 | pages=17&amp;ndash;43 | doi=10.1016/0041-3879(76)90015-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For these and other reasons, BCG was therefore given to time with the peak incidence of pulmonary disease. Routine immunization with BCG was withdrawn in 2005 because of falling cost-effectiveness: whereas in 1953, 94 children would have to be immunized to prevent one case of TB, by 1988, the annual incidence of TB in the UK had fallen so much that 12,000 children would have to be immunized to prevent one case of TB.
*'''India and Pakistan'''  India and Pakistan introduced BCG mass immunization in 1948, the first countries outside Europe to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mahler HT, Mohamed Ali P | title=Review of mass B.C.G. project in India | year=1955 | journal=Ind J Tuberculosis | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=108&amp;ndash;16 | url=http://openmed.nic.in/804/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Brazil''' Brazil introduced universal BCG immunization in 1967-1968, and the practice continues until now. According to Brazilian law, BCG is given again to professionals of the health sector and to people close to patients with tuberculosis or leprosy.
*'''Other countries''' In the UK, BCG was only ever given once (as there is no evidence of additional protection from more than one vaccination), but in some countries, such as the former [[USSR]], BCG was given regularly throughout life.  In [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Malaysia]], BCG was given at birth and again at the age of 12. But in Malaysia and Singapore, from 2001, this policy was changed to once only at birth, and it was discontinued in South Korea.

===Method of administration===
[[Image:BCG apparatus ja2.jpg|thumb|upright|An apparatus (4-5 cm length, with nine short needles) used for BCG vaccination in Japan, shown with ampules of BCG and saline]]
Except in neonates, a [[tuberculin skin test]] should always be done before administering BCG.  A reactive tuberculin skin test is a contraindication to BCG.  Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because there is a high risk of severe local inflammation and scarring, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors &quot;are already immune&quot; and therefore do not need BCG.  People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis.

BCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the deltoid.  If BCG is accidentally given [[subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a [[BCG-oma]]) that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with antibiotics. However, it is important to note an abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is that once pus is aspirated and analysed, providing there are no unusual bacilli present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), &quot;Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?&quot;, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital [http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797]&lt;/ref&gt;

BCG immunization leaves a characteristic raised scar that is often used as proof of prior immunization. The scar of BCG immunization must be distinguished from that of [[small pox vaccination]] which it may resemble.

==Adverse effects==
BCG is one of the most widely used vaccines in the world, with an unparalleled safety record{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  BCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection.  The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&amp;mdash;large, raised scars.  The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used.  If given subcutaneously, BCG causes a local skin infection that may spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing a suppurative lymphadenitis.

If BCG is accidentally given to an immunocompromised patient (e.g., an infant with [[severe combined immune deficiency|SCID]]), it can cause disseminated or life-threatening infection.  The documented incidence of this happening is less than 1 per million immunizations given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title=The role of BCG vaccine in the prevention and control of tuberculosis in the United States: a joint statement of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices | journal=MMWR Recomm Rep | year=1996 | volume=45 | issue=RR-4 | pages=1&amp;ndash;18 | pmid=8602127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] stopped recommending BCG for infants with [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]], even if there is a high risk of exposure to TB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=WHO|title=Revised BCG vaccination guidelines for infants at risk for HIV infection|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|year=2007|volume=82|pages=193&amp;ndash;196|pmid=17526121|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the risk of disseminated BCG infection (which is approximately 400 per 100,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trunz BB, Fine P, Dye C|title=Effect of BCG vaccination on childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis worldwide: a meta-analysis and assessment of cost-effectiveness|journal=Lancet|year=2006|volume=367|issue=9517|pages=1173&amp;ndash;1180|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mak TK, Hesseling AC, Hussey GD, Cotton MF|title=Making BCG vaccination programs safer in the HIV era|journal=Lancet|year=2008|volume=372|issue=9641|pages=786&amp;ndash;787|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61318-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturers==
There are a number of different manufacturers of BCG, and each manufacturer uses a different genetic strain.  This may result in different vaccine potency.
1) OncoTICE (used for bladder instillation for bladder cancer), developed by Organon laboratories, acquired by Schering-Plough, in turn acquired by Merck, Inc.
2) Statens Serum Institut in Denmark
3) Pacis BCG.  Apparently the original BCG strain. First marketed by Urocor in about 2002.  Urocor since acquired by Dianon Systems
4) Evans vaccines (subsidiary of PowerJect Pharmaceuticals Plc, London: PJP)

The '''Common Buzzard'''  (''Buteo buteo'') is a medium to large [[bird of prey]], whose range covers most of [[Europe]] and extends into [[Asia]]. It is typically between 51–57&amp;nbsp;cm in length with a 110 to 150&amp;nbsp;cm (1 metre to a metre and half) (48–60&amp;nbsp;inch) wingspan, making it a medium-sized [[Bird of prey|raptor]]. There are around 40,000 [[breeding pair]]s in Britain. It is usually resident all year, except in the coldest parts of its range, and in the case of one [[subspecies]].

It breeds in [[woodland]]s, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small [[mammal]]s, and will come to [[carrion]]. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects. The birds have incredible strength and are therefore able to pick up food of all weights. 

Buzzards do not normally form [[flocks]], but several may be seen together on [[Bird migration|migration]] or in good habitat. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writer on [[Dartmoor]], [[William Crossing]], noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can been spotted in one field area, approximately 30 metres apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise. 

This broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar [[Rough-legged Buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus'') and the only distantly related [[Honey Buzzard]] (''Pernis apivorus''), which mimics the Common Buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from [[Northern Goshawk]]s. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.

The call is a plaintive ''peea-ay'', similar to a cat's [[Cat communication#Meow|meow]].

==Systematics==
This species was first described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''Systema naturae'' in 1758 as ''Falco buteo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

paludo maculis fuscis. |pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buzzard subspecies fall into two groups.
The western ''Buteo'' group is mainly resident or short-distance [[bird migration|migrants]]. They are:
[[File:Buzzard UK09.JPG|thumb|left|In flight, Devon, UK]]
* ''Buteo buteo buteo'': most of Europe
* ''B. b. rothschildi'': [[Azores]]
* ''B. b. insularum'': [[Canary Islands]]&lt;!-- BirdConservInt14:203 --&gt;
* ''B. b. arrigonii'': [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]]
* ''B. b. menetriesi'': [[Caucasus]]
* ''B. b. harterti'': [[Madeira]], doubtfully distinct from nominate ''Buteo''

The eastern ''vulpinus'' group includes
* ''B. b. vulpinus'' ('''Steppe Buzzard'''): [[Eurasia]]: migrant breeder
* ''B. b. japonicus'': [[Japan]]: resident
* ''B. b. trizonatus''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- part of the vulpinus group, or for that matter a subspecies of B. buteo, according to who? --&gt;('''Forest Buzzard'''): [[South Africa]]: resident – traditionally a subspecies of ''[[Buteo oreophilus|B. oreophilus]]''.

Two resident forms on islands close to [[Africa]] are often assigned to the first group, but appear to be distinct [[species]], more closely related to the African [[Long-legged Buzzard]], based on [[biogeography]] and preliminary [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data (Clouet &amp; Wink 2000):

* ''Buteo (buteo) bannermani'' ('''Cape Verde Buzzard'''): [[Cape Verde Islands]]
* ''Buteo (buteo) socotrae'' ('''Socotra Buzzard'''): [[Socotra]]

==Steppe Buzzard==
The Steppe Buzzard, ''B. (b.) vulpinus'' breeds from eastern Europe eastward to the Far East, excluding Japan. It is a long-distance [[bird migration|migrant]], excepting some north [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.

Steppe Buzzard is some times split as a separate species, ''B. vulpinus''. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller (45–50&amp;nbsp;cm long), longer winged and longer tailed. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is Latin for &quot;fox&quot;), and a dark grey form.

The tail of ''vulpinus'' is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American [[Red-tailed Hawk]]. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in ''B. b. buteo''.

==Forest Buzzard==
The Forest Buzzard, ''B. (b.) trizonatus'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- a subspecies of B. buteo (rather than B. oreophilus) according to who? --&gt; is another form sometimes upgraded to a full species, though most recent authorities have placed it as a subspecies of another species, the [[Mountain Buzzard]], ''B. oreophilus''. This is a resident breeding species in woodlands in southern and eastern South Africa.

It is very similar to the abundant summer migrant Steppe Buzzard, but the adult can be distinguished with a good view by its whiter underparts and unbarred flanks. The juvenile differs from the same-age steppe buzzard by its white front and tear-shaped flank streaks.

The Forest Buzzard, as its name implies, inhabits evergreen woodlands, including introduced [[eucalyptus]] and [[pine]]s, whereas the steppe buzzard prefers more open habitats. However, habitat alone is not a good indicator for these forms.

'''Bohrium''' ({{IPAc-en|bohrium2009.ogg|ˈ|b|ɔər|i|əm}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Bh''' and [[atomic number]] 107 and is the heaviest member of group 7 (VIIB).

It is a [[synthetic element]] whose most stable known [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, has a [[half-life]] of 61 seconds. Chemical experiments have confirmed bohrium's predicted position as a heavier homologue to [[rhenium]] with the formation of a stable +7 [[oxidation state]].&lt;ref name=00Ei01&gt;[http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf &quot;Gas chemical investigation of bohrium (Bh, element 107)&quot;], Eichler et al., ''GSI Annual Report 2000''. Retrieved on 2008-02-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Official discovery===
The first convincing synthesis was in 1981 by a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]] at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (Institute for Heavy Ion Research, GSI) in [[Darmstadt]] using the Dubna reaction.

:{{Nuclide|bismuth|209}} + {{Nuclide|chromium|54}} → {{Nuclide|bohrium|262}} + {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}

In 1989, the GSI team successfully repeated the reaction during their efforts to measure an [[excitation function]]. During these experiments, &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh was also identified in the 2n evaporation channel and it was confirmed that &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh exists as two states - a ground state and an [[nuclear isomer|isomeric]] state.

The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group report in 1992 officially recognised the GSI team as discoverers of bohrium.

===Proposed names===
Historically bohrium has been referred to as '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[rhenium]]'''.

The German group suggested the name ''nielsbohrium'' with symbol ''Ns'' to honor the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. The Soviet scientists had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called [[dubnium]]) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction.

There was an [[element naming controversy]] as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the [[IUPAC]] adopted ''unnilseptium'' (symbol ''Uns'') as a temporary, [[systematic element name]] for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named ''bohrium'', not ''nielsbohrium'', since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994)|year=1994|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=66|pages=2419|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was opposed by the discoverers{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} who were adamant that they had the right to name the element. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC who voted in favour of the name ''bohrium''. There was some concern however that the name might be confused with [[boron]] and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxo-ions bohrate and borate. Despite this, the name ''bohrium'' for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199769122471|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997)|year=1997|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=69|pages=2471|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IUPAC subsequently decided that bohrium salts should be called bohriates.

==Nucleosynthesis==
===Cold fusion===
''This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of bohrium by so-called &quot;cold&quot; fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at low excitation energy (~10-20 MeV, hence &quot;cold&quot;), leading to a higher probability of survival from fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of one or two neutrons only.''

;&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi(&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr,xn)&lt;sup&gt;263-x&lt;/sup&gt;Bh (x=1,2)
The synthesis of bohrium was first attempted in 1976 by scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] at [[Dubna]] using this cold fusion reaction. Analysis was by detection of [[spontaneous fission]] (SF). They discovered two SF activities, one with a 1-2 ms half-life and one with a 5 s activity. Based on the results of other cold fusion reactions, they concluded that they were due to &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Db respectively. However, later evidence gave a much lower SF branching for &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh reducing confidence in this assignment. The assignment of the dubnium activity was later changed to &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Db, presuming that the decay of bohrium was missed. The 2 ms SF activity was assigned to &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Rf resulting from the 33% [[electron capture|EC]] branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements. Part II: Introduction to discovery profiles. Part III: Discovery profiles of the transfermium elements (Note: for Part I see Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 63, No. 6, pp. 879-886, 1991)|year=1993|author=Barber, R. C.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=65|pages=1757|last2=Greenwood|first2=N. N.|last3=Hrynkiewicz|first3=A.

The GSI team studied the reaction in 1981 in their discovery experiments. Five atoms of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh were detected using the method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Identification of element 107 by α correlation chains|doi=10.1007/BF01412623|year=1981|author=Münzenberg, G.|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik a Atoms and Nuclei|volume=300|pages=107|last2=Hofmann|first2=S.|last3=He�berger|first3=F.

C.|last9=Thuma|first9=B.|bibcode = 1981ZPhyA.300..107M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1987, an internal report from Dubna indicated that the team had been able to detect the [[spontaneous fission]] of &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh directly.
The GSI team further studied the reaction in 1989 and discovered the new isotope &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh during the measurement of the 1n and 2n excitation functions but were unable to detect an SF branching for &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01565147|title=Element 107|year=1989|author=Münzenberg, G.|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik a Atomic Nuclei|volume=333|pages=163|last2=Armbruster|first2=P.|last3=Hofmann|first3=S.|last4=Heßberger|first4=F.

They continued their study in 2003 using newly developed bismuth(III) fluoride (BiF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) targets, used to provide further data on the decay data for &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and the daughter &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Db.
The 1n excitation function was remeasured in 2005 by the team at LBNL after some doubt about the accuracy of previous data. They observed 18 atoms of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and 3 atoms of &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and confirmed the two isomers of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://rnc.lbl.gov/nsd/annualreport2005/contributions/Nelson_LE.pdf &quot;Entrance Channel Effects in the Production of &lt;sup&gt;262,261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh&quot;], Nelson et al., ''LBNL repositories 2005''. Retrieved on 2008-03-04&lt;/ref&gt;

;&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi(&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr,xn)&lt;sup&gt;262-x&lt;/sup&gt;Bh
The team at Dubna studied this reaction in 1976 in order to assist in their assignments of the SF activities from their experiments with a Cr-54 beam. They were unable to detect any such activity, indicating the formation of different isotopes decaying primarily by alpha decay.

;&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi(&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr,xn)&lt;sup&gt;261-x&lt;/sup&gt;Bh (x=1)
This reaction was studied for the first time in 2007 by the team at LBNL to search for the lightest bohrium isotope &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Bh. The team successfully detected 8 atoms of &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Bh decaying by correlated 10.16 MeV alpha particle emission to &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Db. The alpha decay energy indicates the continued stabilising effect of the N=152 closed shell.&lt;ref name=&quot;LightestIsotope&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=S.|last2=Gregorich|first2=K.|last3=Dragojević|first3=I.|last4=Garcia|first4=M.|last5=Gates|first5=J.|last6=Sudowe|first6=R.|last7=Nitsche|first7=H.|title=Lightest Isotope of Bh Produced via the Bi209(Cr52,n)Bh260 Reaction|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=100|year=2008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.022501|issue=2|bibcode=2008PhRvL.100b2501N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb(&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn,xn)&lt;sup&gt;263-x&lt;/sup&gt;Bh (x=1)
The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 as part of their newly established cold fusion approach to new elements. As for the reaction using a Bi-209 target, they observed the same SF activities and assigned them to &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;107 and &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;105. Later evidence indicated that these should be reassigned to &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;105 and &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;104 (see above).
In 1983, they repeated the experiment using a new technique: measurement of alpha decay from a descendant using chemical separation. The team were able to detect the alpha decay from a descendant of the 1n evaporation channel, providing some evidence for the formation of element 107 nuclei.
This reaction was later studied in detail using modern techniques by the team at LBNL. In 2005 they measured 33 decays of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and 2 atoms of &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, providing a 1n excitation function and some spectroscopic data of both &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh isomers. The 2n excitation function was further studied in a 2006 repeat of the reaction.

Retrieved on 2008-02-29&lt;/ref&gt; The team found that this reaction had a higher 1n cross section than the corresponding reaction with a Bi-209 target, contrary to expectations. Further research is required to understand the reasons.

===Hot fusion===
''This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of bohrium by so-called &quot;hot&quot; fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40-50 MeV, hence &quot;hot&quot;), leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission and quasi-fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 3-5 neutrons.''

;&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Am(&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P,xn)&lt;sup&gt;269-x&lt;/sup&gt;Bh (x=5?)
This reaction was first studied in 2006 at the LBNL as part of their systematic study of fusion reactions using &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U targets. Results have not been published but preliminary results appear to indicate the observation of [[spontaneous fission]], possibly from &lt;sup&gt;264&lt;/sup&gt;Bh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wnt.gsi.de/tasca06/images/contributions/TASCA_06_Gates.pdf Hot fusion studies at the BGS with light projectiles and 238U targets], J.

This reaction was studied for the first time in 2008 by the team at RIKEN, Japan, in order to study the decay properties of &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, which is a decay product in their claimed decay chains of [[ununtrium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0904.1093 |doi=10.1143/JPSJ.78.064201 |title=Decay Properties of &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db Produced in the &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm + &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na Reaction |year=2009 |author=Morita, Kosuke |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=78 |pages=064201 |coauthors=''et al.'' |issue=6|bibcode = 2009JPSJ...78f4201M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decay of &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh by the emission of 9.05-9.23 MeV alpha particles was further confirmed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morita|first1=K.|last2=Morimoto|first2=K.|last3=Kaji|first3=D.|last4=Haba|first4=H.|last5=Ozeki|first5=K.|last6=Kudou|first6=Y.|last7=Sato|first7=N.|last8=Sumita|first8=T.|last9=Yoneda|first9=A.|title=Decay Properties of [sup 266]Bh and [sup 262]Db Produced in the [sup 248]Cm+[sup 23]Na Reaction—Further Confirmation of the [sup 278]113 Decay Chain—|pages=331|year=2010|doi=10.1063/1.3455961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempts to synthesize bohrium by hot fusion pathways were performed in 1979 by the team at Dubna. The reaction was repeated in 1983. In both cases, they were unable to detect any [[spontaneous fission]] from nuclei of bohrium.
More recently, hot fusions pathways to bohrium have been re-investigated in order to allow for the synthesis of more long-lived, [[neutron]] rich isotopes to allow a first chemical study of bohrium. In 1999, the team at LBNL claimed the discovery of long-lived &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Bh (5 atoms) and &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh (1 atom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.2697 |title=Evidence for New Isotopes of Element 107: &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Bh|year=2000|author=Wilk, P.

;&lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es(&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O,xn)&lt;sup&gt;270-x&lt;/sup&gt;Bh
As an alternative means of producing long-lived bohrium isotopes suitable for a chemical study, the synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh were attempted in 1995 by the team at GSI using the highly asymmetric reaction using an einsteinium-254 target. They were unable to detect any product atoms.

== Occurrence ==
The occurrence of bohrium in nature in such minerals as [[molybdenite]], through long-lived isotopes. However this has been deemed as highly unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivanov|first1=A. V.|title=The possible existence of Hs in nature from a geochemical point of view|journal=Physics of Particles and Nuclei Letters|volume=3|pages=165|year=2006|doi=10.1134/S1547477106030046|issue=3|arxiv = nucl-th/0604052 |bibcode = 2006PPNL....3..165I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of bohrium}}
A total of eleven isotopes of bohrium have been characterized. The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the chains of the elements 109 and 111, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The four most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, and 274 appear in decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;113, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;115, &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;115, and &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;117 respectively. These ten isotopes have half-lives ranging from 8 miliseconds to 0.9 minute, and all undergo alpha-decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doi_&quot; /&gt;

===Nuclear isomerism===
;&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh
The only confirmed example of isomerism in bohrium is for the isotope &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh. Direct production populates two states, a ground state and an isomeric state. The ground state is confirmed as decaying by alpha emission with alpha lines at 10.08,9.82 and 9.76 MeV with a revised half life of 84 ms. The excited state decays by alpha emission with lines at 10.37 and 10.24 MeV with a revised half-life of 9.6 ms.

==Chemical properties==
===Extrapolated===
Bohrium is projected to be the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group VII in the Periodic Table, below [[manganese]], [[technetium]] and [[rhenium]]. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well.

The heavier members of the group are known to form volatile heptoxides M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, so BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and MO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ReF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.

===Experimental===
In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malmbeck|first1=R.|last2=Skarnemark|first2=G.|last3=Alstad|first3=J.|last4=Fure|first4=K.|last5=Johansson|first5=M.|last6=Omtvedt|first6=J. P.|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=246|pages=349|year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1006791027906|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, scientist confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, the 107-th element does behave like a typical [[group 7 element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gäggeler|first1=H. W.|last2=Eichler|first2=R.|last3=Brüchle|first3=W.|last4=Dressler|first4=R.|last5=Düllmann|first5=Ch.E.|last6=Eichler|first6=B.|last7=Gregorich|first7=K. E.|last8=Hoffman|first8=D. C.|last9=Hübener|first9=S.|title=Chemical characterization of bohrium (element 107)|journal=Nature|volume=407|issue=6800|pages=63|year=2000|pmid=10993071|doi=10.1038/35024044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a team at the PSI conducted a chemistry reaction using atoms of &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Bh produced in the reaction between Bk-249 and Ne-22 ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, [[technetium]] (as &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) and [[rhenium]] (as &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.&lt;ref name=00Ei01/&gt;

'''Barbara Olson''' (December 27, 1955{{ndash}} September 11, 2001) was a [[lawyer]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[United States|American]] [[television]] commentator who worked for [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], and several other outlets. She was a passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 77]] en route to a taping of the television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' when it was flown into [[the Pentagon]] in the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Early life==
Olson was born '''Barbara Kay Bracher''' in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. (Her older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, has been a member of the Houston City Council since 2004.) She graduated from [[Waltrip High School]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm Waltrip Trivia Page],&quot; ''[[Waltrip High School]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the [[University of St. Thomas (Houston)|University of Saint Thomas]] in Houston.

==Career==
As a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for [[HBO]] and [[Stacey Keach Productions]]. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Yeshiva University]]'s [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]]. In the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of [[Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an assistant U.S. attorney. In 1994, she left to work for the [[United States House of Representatives]], becoming chief investigative counsel for the [[House Government Reform and Oversight Committee]]. In that position, she led the [[Travelgate]] and [[Filegate]] investigations into the Clinton administration. She co-founded the [[Independent Women's Forum]] with [[Rosalie Silberman]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.iwf.org/articles/article_detail.asp?ArticleID=372 &quot;Remembering IWF Founder Barbara Olson&quot;], [[Rosalie Silberman]], [[Independent Women's Forum]], December 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anita K. Blair]]. She was later a partner in the [[Washington, D.C.]] office of the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] [[law firm]] [[Balch &amp; Bingham]]. 

Her support of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas led to the formation of the Independent Women's Forum, which had its origins in 1991-92, when Mrs. Olson and friend &quot;Ricky&quot; Rosalie Gaull Silberman started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[Anita Hill]], a former colleague at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mrs. Olson also had worked with Thomas at the commission and was a close friend. During his contentious confirmation, she spoke out on his behalf and helped edit ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'',a book by [[David Brock]] that savaged Hill and portrayed her charges as a political dirty trick (Brock later recanted his claims and apologized to Hill). The idea for the Independent Women's Forum was to create a high profile group of women who advocated economic liberty, personal responsibility, and political freedom.

She married [[Theodore Olson]] in 1996. He went on to successfully represent presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which effectively determined the final result of the contested [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]]. He subsequently served as [[United States Solicitor General]] in the Bush administration. 

She was a frequent critic of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] and wrote a book about then [[First Lady]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'' (1999). Olson was working on her second book, ''The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House'' (published October 2001) at the time of her death. She was a resident of [[Great Falls, Virginia]].

==Death==
Olson was a passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 77]] on her way to a taping of ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' in [[Los Angeles]], when it was flown into [[the Pentagon]] in the [[September 11 attacks]]. 

Flight 77 was hijacked at 8:54. At some point between 9:16 and 9:26, Olson called her husband. According to him, she reported that the flight had been hijacked, and the hijackers had knives and box-cutters.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;''[[9/11 Commission Report|The 9/11 Commission Report]]'', Official Government Edition, July 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She further indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call, and that they had put all the passengers in the rear of the plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot; /&gt; About a minute into the conversation, the call was cut off.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot; /&gt;

Shortly after, Barbara reached her husband again. She reported that the &quot;[[Hani Hanjour|pilot]]&quot; had announced that the flight had been hijacked, and asked her husband what she should tell the captain to do. Ted Olson asked for her location and she replied that the aircraft was then flying over houses. Another passenger told her they were traveling northeast. Ted Olson informed Barbara of the two previous hijackings and crashes. She did not display signs of panic at the time. The second call was soon cut off.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;/&gt;

''Politically Incorrect'' host [[Bill Maher]] left a panel seat vacant for a week following her death.

==Memorial lectures==
The [[Federalist Society]] has established the Barbara K. Olson Memorial Lectures, &quot;an annual lecture on limited government and the spirit of freedom&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fed-soc.org/resources/id.62/default.asp Barbara K. Olson Memorial Lecture], [[Federalist Society]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the American [[astronomer]] [[Edward Emerson Barnard|E.E. Barnard]] measured its [[proper motion]] as 10.3 [[minute of arc|arcsecond]]s per year, which remains the largest-known proper motion of any star relative to the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EEB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Despite its proximity, Barnard's Star, at a dim [[apparent magnitude]] of about nine, is not visible with the unaided eye; however, it is much brighter in [[infrared light]] than it is in [[visible light]].

Barnard's Star has been the subject of much study, and it has probably received more attention from astronomers than any other class [[M dwarf]] star due to its proximity and favorable location for observation near the [[celestial equator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its [[astrometry]], and also refining the limits of possible [[extrasolar planet]]s. Although Barnard's Star is an ancient star, some observations suggest that it still experiences [[flare star|star flare]] events.

Barnard's Star has also been the subject of some controversy. For a decade, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s, [[Peter van de Kamp]] claimed that there was a [[gas giant]] [[extrasolar planet|planet]] (or planets) in orbit around it. While the presence of small terrestrial planets around the star remains a possibility, Van de Kamp's specific claims of large gas giant planets were refuted in the mid 1970s.

Barnard's Star is also notable as the target for [[Project Daedalus]], a study on the possibility of fast, unmanned [[Interstellar travel|travel to nearby star systems]].

== Overview ==
Barnard's Star is a red dwarf of the dim [[stellar classification|spectral type]] M4, and it is too faint to see without a [[telescope]]. Its [[apparent magnitude]] is 9.54.&lt;ref name=&quot;simbad&quot; /&gt; This compares with a magnitude of −1.5 for [[Sirius]] – the brightest star in the night sky – and about 6.0 for the faintest visible objects with the naked eye (this magnitude scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], and so the magnitude of 9.54 is only about 1/27th of the brightness of the faintest star that can be seen with the naked eye under good viewing conditions).

At seven to 12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun, and it might be among the oldest stars in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedel2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

However in 1998, astronomers observed an intense [[stellar flare]], surprisingly showing that Barnard's Star is a [[flare star]].&lt;ref name=Flare&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=2006-08-10 | title=A Flare for Barnard's Star
 | work=Astronomy Magazine | publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Co }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard's Star has the [[variable star]] [[Variable star designation|designation]] V2500 Ophiuchi. In 2003, Barnard's Star presented the first detectable change in the [[radial velocity]] of a star caused by its motion. Further variability in the radial velocity of Barnard's Star was attributed to its stellar activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurster&quot; /&gt;

The proper motion of Barnard's Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed (&quot;sideways&quot; relative to our line of sight to the Sun) of 90&amp;nbsp;[[kilometers per second|km/s]]. The 10.3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaler&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = James B. | last = Kaler | url = http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/barnard.html | title = Barnard's Star (V2500 Ophiuchi) | month = November | year = 2005 | work = Stars | publisher = James B. Kaler | accessdate = September 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radial velocity of Barnard's Star towards the Sun can be measured by its [[blue shift]]. Two measurements are given in [[Star catalogue|catalogue]]s: 106.8&amp;nbsp;km/s in [[SIMBAD]], which refers to a 1967 compilation of older measurements, and 110.8&amp;nbsp;km/s in ARICNS and similar values in all modern astronomical references. These measurements, combined with proper motion, suggest a true velocity relative to the Sun of 139.7 and 142.7&amp;nbsp;km/s, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''tv'' = (90&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 106.8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; = 139.7, or ''tv'' = (90&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 110.8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; = 142.7. Stars with a large proper motion naturally have large true velocities relative to the Sun, but proper motion is also a function of the distance from the Sun. While Barnard's Star has the largest proper motion, the largest known true velocity of another star in the [[Milky Way]] belongs to [[Wolf 424]] at 555&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11,700, when it approaches to within about 3.8 light-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=García-Sánchez | first=J. | bibcode = 2001A&amp;A...379..634G | title=Stellar encounters with the solar system | journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume=379 | page=642 | year=2001 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20011330}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time, Barnard's Star will not be the nearest star, since [[Proxima Centauri]] will have moved even closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Matthews | first=R.

M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye at the time of its closest approach, since its apparent magnitude will be about 8.5 then. After that it will gradually recede from the Sun.
[[Image:Barnard2005.gif|thumb|Barnard's Star, showing position every 5 years 1985–2005]]

Barnard's Star has approximately 17% of a [[solar mass]], and it has a radius 15% to 20% of that of the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ochsenbein&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ochsenbein |first=F. |year=1982 |month=March |title=A list of stars with large expected angular diameters |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume=47 |pages=523–531 | bibcode = 1982A&amp;AS...47..523O |accessdate= October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, its radius was estimated as 0.20±0.008 of the [[solar radius]], at the high end of the ranges that were typically calculated in the past, indicating that previous estimates of the radius of Barnard's Star probably underestimated the actual value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson&quot; /&gt; Thus, although Barnard's Star has roughly 180 times the mass of Jupiter, its radius is only 1.5 to 2.0 times larger, reflecting the tendency of objects in the [[brown dwarf]] range to be about the same size. Its [[effective temperature]] is 3,134(±102) [[kelvin]], and it has a visual luminosity just 4/10,000ths of solar luminosity, corresponding to a bolometric luminosity of 34.6/10,000ths.&lt;ref name =&quot;Dawson&quot; /&gt; Barnard's Star is so faint that if it were at the same distance from Earth as the Sun is, it would appear only 100 times brighter than a full moon, comparable to the brightness of the Sun at 80 [[Astronomical Unit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolStation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.solstation.com/stars/barnards.htm | title = Barnard's Star | publisher = Sol Station|accessdate = August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broad survey of the [[metallicity]] of M-class dwarf stars, Barnard's Star's was placed between −0.5 and −1.0 on the metallicity scale, which is roughly 10 to 32% of the value for the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizis&quot; /&gt; Metallicity, the proportion of stellar mass made up of elements heavier than [[helium]], helps classify stars relative to the galactic population. Barnard's Star seems to be typical of the old, red dwarf [[population II star]]s, yet these are also generally metal-poor [[halo star]]s. While sub-solar, Barnard's Star's metallicity is higher than a halo star and is in keeping with the low end of the metal-rich [[disk star]] range; this, plus its high space motion, have led to the designation &quot;Intermediate Population II star&quot;, between a halo and disk star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurster&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kürster | first=M. | year = 2003 | title = The low-level radial velocity variability in Barnard's Star | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics | bibcode = 2003A&amp;A...403.1077K | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20030396 | volume = 403 | issue = 6 | page = 1077 | accessdate = August 16, 2006 | last2=Endl | first2=M. | last3=Rouesnel | first3=F. | last4=Els | first4=S. | last5=Kaufer | first5=A. | last6=Brillant | first6=S. | last7=Hatzes | first7=A.

== Claims of a planetary system ==

For a decade from 1963 to about 1973, a substantial number of astronomers accepted a claim by [[Peter van de Kamp]] that he had detected, by using [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|astrometry]], a perturbation in the [[proper motion]] of Barnard's Star consistent with its having one or more planets comparable in mass with [[Jupiter]]. Van de Kamp had been observing the star from 1938, attempting, with colleagues at the [[Swarthmore College]] observatory, to find minuscule variations of one [[micrometre]] in its position on [[photographic plates]] consistent with [[orbital perturbation]]s (wobbles) in the star that would indicate a planetary companion; this involved as many as ten people averaging their results in looking at plates, to avoid systemic, individual errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunder&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1635.html | title = The Barnard's Star Blunder | year = 2005 | month=July| work = Astrobiology Magazine | accessdate = August 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van de Kamp's initial suggestion was a planet having about 1.6 the Jovian mass at a distance of 4.4 AU in a slightly eccentric orbit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1963 | title = Astrometric study of Barnard's star from plates taken with the 24-inch Sproul refractor | journal = Astronomical Journal | volume = 68 | issue = 7 | page = 515|bibcode = 1963AJ.....68..515V|doi = 10.1086/109001 }} [http://www.webcitation.org/5ni3oNB9x Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; and these measurements were apparently refined in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1969 | title = Parallax, proper motion acceleration, and orbital motion of Barnard's Star | journal = Astronomical Journal | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | page = 238|bibcode = 1969AJ.....74..238V|doi = 10.1086/110799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Van de Kamp suggested that there were two planets of 1.1 and 0.8 Jovian masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1969 | title = Alternate dynamical analysis of Barnard's star | journal = Astronomical Journal | volume = 74 | issue = 8 | page = 757 | bibcode = 1969AJ.....74..757V | accessdate = August 10, 2006 | doi = 10.1086/110852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RedDwarfPlanet.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's conception of a planet in orbit around a red dwarf star.]]

Other astronomers subsequently repeated Van de Kamp's measurements, and two important papers in 1973 undermined the claim of a planet or planets. [[George Gatewood]] and Heinrich Eichhorn, at a different observatory and using newer plate measuring techniques, failed to verify the planetary companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gatewood, George, and Eichhorn, H. | year = 1973 | title = An unsuccessful search for a planetary companion of Barnard's star (BD +4 3561) | bibcode = 1973AJ.....78..769G | journal = Astronomical Journal | volume = 78 | issue = 10 | page = 769 | accessdate = August 9, 2006 | doi = 10.1086/111480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper published by John L. Hershey four months earlier, also using the Swarthmore observatory, found that changes in the astrometric field of various stars correlated to the timing of adjustments and modifications that had been carried out on the refractor telescope's objective lens;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = John L.

[http://www.webcitation.org/5qEEedgOJ Archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

Van de Kamp never acknowledged any error and published a further confirmation of two planets' existence as late as 1982;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van de Kamp, Peter. | year = 1982 | title = The planetary system of Barnard's star | journal = Vistas in Astronomy | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | page = 141 | bibcode = 1982VA.....26..141V | doi = 10.1016/0083-6656(82)90004-6 | accessdate = August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; he died in 1995. [[Wulff Heintz]], Van de Kamp's successor at Swarthmore and an expert on [[double stars]], questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards. The two men were reported to have become estranged from each other because of this.&lt;ref name=Swathmore&gt;{{cite web | first = Bill | last =Kent | url = http://media.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_2001_03.pdf | title = Barnard's Wobble | year = 2001 | work = Bulletin | publisher = Swarthmore College | accessdate = June 2, 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5qBBj8cDN Archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refining planetary boundaries ===
While not completely ruling out the possibility of planets, null results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 90s, the latest based on [[interferometric]] work with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1999.&lt;ref name = Hubble99&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benedict | year=1999 | month=August | title = Interferometric Astrometry of Proxima Centauri and Barnard's Star Using Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor 3: Detection Limits for sub-Stellar Companions

M dwarfs such as Barnard's Star are more easily studied than larger stars in this regard because their lower masses render perturbations more obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michael Endl, William D. Cochran, Robert G. Tull, and Phillip J. MacQueen. | year = 2003 | title = A Dedicated M Dwarf Planet Search Using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope | journal = The Astronomical Journal | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/379137 | doi = 10.1086/379137 | volume = 126 | issue = 12 | page = 3099 | accessdate = August 18, 2006 | bibcode=2003AJ....126.3099E|arxiv = astro-ph/0308477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatewood was thus able to show in 1995 that planets with 10 times the mass of Jupiter (the lower limit for [[brown dwarfs]]) were impossible around Barnard's Star,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot; /&gt; in a paper which helped refine the negative certainty regarding planetary objects in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatewood95&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=George D.

While this research has greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard's Star, it has not ruled them out completely; [[terrestrial planets]] would be difficult to detect. [[NASA]]'s [[Space Interferometry Mission]], which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, had chosen Barnard's Star as a search target.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolStation&quot; /&gt; However, this mission was shut down at the end of 2010, and is not expected to be funded again in the 2010s.&lt;ref name=SIM&gt;{{cite web | first = James | last = Marr | url = http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/SIM/projectNews/projectManagerUpdates/ | title = Updates from the Project Manager | date = 8 November 2010 | publisher = NASA | accessdate = January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ESA]]'s similar [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] interferometry mission had the same goal, but was stripped of funding in 2007 and is unlikely to be revived.)

== Project Daedalus ==
{{main|Project Daedalus}}

Excepting the planet controversy, the best known study of Barnard's Star was part of [[Project Daedalus]]. Undertaken between 1973 and 1978, it suggested that rapid, unmanned travel to another star system is possible with existing or near-future technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daedalus76&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bond, A., and Martin, A.R. | year = 1976 | title = Project Daedalus&amp;nbsp;— The mission profile | journal = [[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]] | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A7618970AH&amp;q=project+daedalus&amp;uid=788304424&amp;setcookie=yes | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | page = 101 | accessdate = August 15, 2006|bibcode = 1976JBIS...29..101B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard's Star was chosen as a target, partly because it was believed to have planets.&lt;ref name=DarlingDaedalus&gt;{{cite web | first = David | last = Darling | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/D/Daedalus.html | title = Daedalus, Project | month = July |year=2005 | work = The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight | accessdate = August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical model suggested that a nuclear pulse rocket employing [[nuclear fusion]] (specifically, electron bombardment of [[deuterium]] and [[helium-3]]) and accelerating for four years could achieve a velocity of 12% of the [[speed of light]]. The star could then be reached in 50 years, within a human lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarlingDaedalus&quot; /&gt; Along with detailed investigation of the star and any companions, the [[interstellar medium]] would be examined and baseline astrometric readings performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daedalus76&quot; /&gt;

The initial Project Daedalus model sparked further theoretical research. In 1980, [[Robert Freitas]] suggested a more ambitious plan: a [[self-replicating spacecraft]] intended to search for and make contact with [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name=Repro&gt;{{cite journal | first=Robert A., Jr. | last=Freitas | title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe | journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]] | volume=33 | month=July | year=1980 | pages=251–264 | url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm | accessdate =October 1, 2008|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..251F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Built and launched in [[Jupiter|Jovian]] orbit, it would reach Barnard's Star in 47 years under parameters similar to those of the original Project Daedalus. Once at the star, it would begin automated self-replication, constructing a factory, initially to manufacture exploratory probes and eventually to create a copy of the original spacecraft after 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Repro&quot; /&gt;

== The flare in 1998 ==
The observation of a [[stellar flare]] on Barnard's Star has added another element of interest to its study. Noted by William Cochran, University of Texas at Austin, based on changes in the [[spectral emissions]] on July 17, 1998 (during an unrelated search for planetary &quot;wobbles&quot;), it was four more years before the flare was fully analyzed. At that point Diane Paulson ''et al.'', now of [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], suggested that the flare's temperature was 8000 K, more than twice the normal temperature of the star, although simply analyzing the spectra cannot precisely determine the flare's total output.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Diane B. | last = Paulson | year = 2006 | title = Optical Spectroscopy of a Flare on Barnard's Star | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/499497 | volume = 118 | issue = 1 | page = 227 | doi=10.1086/499497 | accessdate = August 21, 2006 | format = abstract | last2 = Allred | first2 = Joel C. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Ryan B. | last4 = Hawley | first4 = Suzanne L. | last5 = Cochran | first5 = William D. | last6 = Yelda | first6 = Sylvana | bibcode=2006PASP..118..227P|arxiv = astro-ph/0511281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the essentially random nature of flares, she noted &quot;the star would be fantastic for amateurs to observe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flare&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:RedDwarfNASA-hue-shifted.jpg|right|thumb|Artist's conception of a [[red dwarf]] star]]
The flare was surprising because intense stellar activity is not expected around stars of such age. Flares are not completely understood, but are believed to be caused by strong [[magnetic fields]] which suppress [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[convection]] and lead to sudden outbursts: strong magnetic fields occur in rapidly rotating stars, while old stars tend to rotate slowly. An event of such magnitude around Barnard's Star is thus presumed to be a rarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulson&quot; /&gt; Research on the star's periodicity, or changes in stellar activity over a given timescale, also suggest it ought to be quiescent; 1998 research showed weak evidence for periodic variation in Barnard's Star's brightness, noting only one possible starspot over 130 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedict1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last= Benedict | first=G. Fritz | year = 1998 | title = Photometry of Proxima Centauri and Barnard's star using Hubble Space Telescope fine guidance senso 3 | journal = The Astronomical Journal | bibcode = 1998AJ....116..429B | volume = 116 | issue = 1 | page = 429 | accessdate = August 18, 2006 | doi= 10.1086/300420 | last2= McArthur | first2= Barbara | last3= Nelan | first3= E. | last4= Story | first4= D. | last5= Whipple | first5= A.

Stellar activity of this sort has created interest in using Barnard's Star as a proxy to understand similar stars. Photometric studies of its [[X-ray]] and [[Ultraviolet|UV]] emissions are hoped to shed light on the large population of old M dwarfs in the galaxy. Such research has [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] implications: given that the habitable zones of M dwarfs are close to the star, any planets would be strongly influenced by solar flares, winds, and plasma ejection events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedel2005&quot; /&gt;

== The star's neighborhood ==
Barnard's Star shares much the same neighborhood as the Sun. The neighbors of Barnard's Star are generally of red dwarf size, the smallest and most common star type. Its closest neighbor is currently the red dwarf [[Ross 154]], at 1.66 parsecs or 5.41 light years distance. The Sun and [[Alpha Centauri]] are, respectively, the next closest systems.&lt;ref name=SolStation/&gt; From Barnard's Star, the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at coordinates RA={{RA|5|57|48.5}}, Dec={{DEC|−04|41|36}}, in the eastern part of the constellation [[Monoceros]]. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 and at a distance of 1.834 parsecs, it would be an impressively bright first-magnitude star, like [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] is from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;The Sun’s apparent magnitude from Barnard’s Star: &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix} m = 4.83 + 5\cdot((\log_{10} 1.834) - 1) = 1.15 \end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bayer designation''' is a stellar designation in which a specific star is identified by a [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]], followed by the [[genitive case|genitive]] form of its parent constellation's [[Latin language|Latin]] name. The original list of Bayer designations contained 1,564 stars.

Most of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names by the [[Germany|German]] [[astronomer]] [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603, in his star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]'' (named after [[Urania]], the Greek [[Muse]] of [[Astronomy]], along with [[Uranus]], the Greek god of the sky and heavens). Bayer assigned a lower-case Greek letter, such as alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), etc., to each star he catalogued, combined with the Latin name of the star’s parent constellation in [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) form. (See [[List of constellations]] for the genitive forms.) For example, [[Aldebaran]] is designated ''α Tauri'' (pronounced ''Alpha Tauri''), which means &quot;Alpha of [[Taurus (constellation)|the Bull]]&quot;.  (The letters of the Greek alphabet were [[Greek numerals|used in antiquity as numerals]], so Bayer's scheme might be regarded as a numbering system.)

A single constellation may contain fifty or more stars, but the Greek alphabet has only twenty-four letters; when these ran out, Bayer began using lower-case Latin letters: hence ''[[HD 90853|s Carinae]]'' (''s'' of [[Carina (constellation)|the Keel]]) and ''[[d Centauri]]'' (''d'' of [[Centaurus|the Centaur]]). Within constellations having an extremely large number of stars, Bayer eventually advanced to upper-case Latin letters, as in ''[[G Scorpii]]'' (''G'' of [[Scorpius (constellation)|the Scorpion]]) and ''[[HD 82668|N Velorum]]'' (''N'' of [[Vela (constellation)|the Sails]]).  The last letter used by Bayer was ''Q''.

==Is Alpha always the brightest star?==
For the most part, Bayer assigned Greek and Latin letters to stars in rough order of apparent brightness, from brightest to dimmest, within a particular constellation.  Since in a majority of constellations the brightest star is designated Alpha (α), many people wrongly assume that Bayer meant to put the stars exclusively in order of their brightness, but in his day there was no way to measure stellar brightness precisely. Traditionally, the stars were assigned to one of six magnitude classes, and Bayer's catalog lists all the first-magnitude stars, followed by all the second-magnitude stars, and so on.  Within each magnitude class, Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness.&lt;ref name=jha17_50_189&gt;{{cite journal

 | bibcode=1986JHA....17..189S
}} See p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer did not always follow this rule; he sometimes assigned letters to stars according to their location within a constellation (for example: the northern, southern, eastern, or western part of a constellation), according to the order in they rise in the east, according to historical or mythological information on specific stars within a constellation, or according to his own random choosing.  Usually the stars were roughly ordered from the head to the feet (or tail) of the figure (as in the [[Big Dipper]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Of the 88 modern constellations, there are at least 30 in which &quot;Alpha&quot; is not the brightest star, and four of those lack an alpha star altogether.  (Constellations with no alpha include [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] and [[Puppis]], both formerly part of [[Argo Navis]] whose alpha is [[Canopus]] in [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]].)

[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] provides a good example of Bayer's method. (The ''lower'' the magnitude, the ''brighter'' the star; additionally, there is a precise definition: a &quot;2nd-magnitude&quot; star ranks between 1.51 and 2.50, inclusive.)  Bayer first designated the two 1st-magnitude stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, as Alpha and Beta, with Betelgeuse (the shoulder) coming ahead of Rigel (the foot), even though the latter is usually the brighter. (Betelgeuse, a variable star, can at its maximum very occasionally be brighter than Rigel.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Moore, ''Brilliant Stars'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;)
He then repeated the procedure for the stars of the 2nd magnitude. As is evident from the map and chart, he again followed a &quot;top-down&quot; (&quot;north-south&quot;) route.

==Various Bayer designation arrangements==
This &quot;First to Rise in the East&quot; method is done in a number of other instances, even for [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]]. Although Pollux is brighter than Castor, the latter was assigned ''alpha'' because it rises in the east ahead of the former. Bayer may also have assigned the stars Castor and Pollux in terms of historical or mythological knowledge. Both historically and mythologically, Castor's name is almost always mentioned first (Castor and Pollux) whenever the twins are mentioned, and that may have compelled him to assign ''alpha'' (α) to Castor and ''beta'' (β) to Pollux.

Although the brightest star in Draco is Eltanin ([[Gamma Draconis]]), [[Thuban]] was assigned ''alpha'' (α) by Bayer because Thuban, in history, was once the [[pole star|north pole star]], 4,000 years ago. Almost every star with a history of being the [[North Star]], including [[Vega]], [[Alderamin]] and [[Polaris]], were designated as the ''alpha'' (α) of their parent constellations by Bayer.

Sometimes, indeed, there's no apparent order, as exemplified by the stars in [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] and [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], where Bayer assigned designations to stars at random.

==Revised Bayer designations==
Some stars were &quot;border stars&quot;, falling on the boundaries between two constellations, and Bayer would assign them a Greek letter from each constellation. The two most prominent examples are [[Beta Tauri|β Tau]]/γ [[Auriga (constellation)|Aur]], and [[Alpha Andromedae|α And]]/δ [[Pegasus (constellation)|Peg]]. When the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) outlined the official 88 constellations with definite boundaries in 1930, it declared that stars and other celestial objects can be assigned to only one constellation.  Consequently, the redundant Bayer designations for those two stars were scrapped, and now only Beta Tauri and Alpha Andromedae are used.  Another star, [[Sigma Librae|σ Lib]], was formerly known as γ [[Scorpius (constellation)|Sco]], though it is well inside [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].  A few stars still do not lie (according to the modern constellation boundaries) within the constellation for which they are named. Nonetheless, these designations have proved useful and are widely used today.

==Bayer designation styles==
There are two common ways in which Bayer designations can be written. The designation can be written out in full, as in [[Alpha Canis Majoris]] or [[Beta Persei]], or a lowercase Greek letter can be used together with the standard 3-letter abbreviation of the constellation, as in α CMa or β Per. Or the two can be combined (α Canis Majoris). Earlier 4-letter abbreviations (such as α CMaj) are rarely used today.

==Other Bayer designations==
The Latin-letter extended designations are rarely used, but there are some exceptions such as [[h Persei]] (which is actually a [[star cluster]]) and [[P Cygni]]. Uppercase Latin Bayer designations never went beyond Q; names such as [[R Leporis]] and [[W Ursae Majoris]] are [[variable star designation]]s, not Bayer designations.

A further complication is the use of numeric superscripts to distinguish between stars with the same Bayer letter. Usually these are [[double star]]s (mostly optical doubles rather than true [[binary star]]s), but there are some exceptions such as the chain of stars [[Pi1 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Pi2 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Pi3 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Pi4 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Pi5 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Pi6 Orionis|π&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Pi Orionis|Orionis]].

'''Boötes''' ({{IPA-en|boʊˈoʊtiːz|US}} {{IPA-en|bəʊˈəʊtiːz|UK}}, or boh-'oh-tees&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/spacewatch/lc_pronunciation.html&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° [[declination]], and 13 and 16 hours of [[right ascension]] on the [[celestial sphere]]. The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Βοώτης, ''Boōtēs'', meaning [[herder|herdsman]] or [[plowman]] (literally, ox-driver; from ''boos'', related to the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''bovis'', “cow”). The &quot;ö&quot; in the name is a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], not an [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]], meaning that each 'o' is to be pronounced separately.

Boötes was one of the 48 [[constellation]]s described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and is now one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s. It contains the [[List of brightest stars|third brightest star]] in the night sky, [[Arcturus]].

== Notable features ==
===Stars===
[[Tau Boötis|τ Boötis]], a relatively [[Sun]]-like star, is orbited by the massive [[hot Jupiter]] planet [[Tau Boötis Ab|τ Boötis Ab]]. It was the fourth [[extrasolar planet]] to be discovered and is one of the most studied. Boötes also hosts a large number of double stars suitable for viewing by amateur astronomers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Deep sky objects===
*[[NGC 5466]] is a loose globular cluster that can be observed with most telescopes. It was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on May 17, 1784.
*The [[Boötes void]], a large section of the [[universe]] devoid of galaxies, is located in the area of Boötes.
*The [[Boötes Dwarf Galaxy]] (Boo I dSph) is a faint, satellite galaxy of the Milky Way located in Boötes about 197 000 light-years (60 [[Kiloparsec|kpc]]) away from Earth.

==History==
The [[former constellations|former constellation]] [[Mons Maenalus]], created by [[Johannes Hevelius]], resided in the southern part of Boötes. It contained only faint stars barely visible to the naked eye.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Mythology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
In ancient Babylon the stars of Bootes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god [[Enlil]], who was the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and special patron of farmers.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in [[Greek mythology]] is not clear. According to one version, he was a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation [[Ursa Major]] using his two dogs ''Chara'' and ''Asterion'' (from the constellation [[Canes Venatici]]). The oxen were tied to the polar axis and so the action of Boötes kept the heavens in constant rotation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Boötes was also supposed to have invented the [[plough]]. This is said to have greatly pleased [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the goddess of agriculture who asked [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to give Boötes a permanent fixture in the heavens as a reward for doing this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Another version portrays Boötes as a grape grower called [[Icarius]], who one day invited the Roman god Bacchus, also called [[Dionysus]], to inspect his vineyards. Bacchus revealed the secret of [[wine making]] to Icarius, who was so impressed by this alcoholic beverage that he invited his friends round to sample it. Having never tasted wine before, they all drank too much and woke up the next morning with terrible [[hangover]]s; and they made the mistaken assumption that Icarius had tried to poison them. It was decided that Icarius should pay the price with his own life, and he was swiftly murdered in his sleep. Bacchus placed Icarius in the stars to honor him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Following another reading the constellation is identified with [[Arcas]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a wolf and gave back life to his son. In the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-bear, by Zeus' wife, [[Hera]], who was angry at Zeus' infidelity. When he was grown up, Arcas met with the she-bear and, since obviously he didn't recognize her as his mother, he began to chase Callisto. Callisto, followed by Arcas, sheltered herself in a temple, a sacred place whose profaners were convicted to death. To avoid such fate, Zeus decided to set them in the sky, Arcas as Boötes and Callisto as Ursa Major. This is a rare version of the myth surrounding Ursa Major, as the myth usually holds that Arcas is transformed into a bear as well (becoming Ursa Minor), and in such versions Boötes has no part. Ursa Minor, and Ursa Major, are constellations whose identification only originated in later classical Greece, and in Rome, and as such Boötes kept separate associations dating from much earlier.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In Ovid's Metamorphoses VIII, Icarus is told by his father Daedalus, upon receiving the wings, to fly using the Boötes and Orion as guides.  Icarus ignores the advice to run this &quot;middle path&quot; and subsequently drowns.

==Visualizations==
[[File:Bootesurania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Boötes as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. In his left hand he holds his hunting dogs, Canes Venatici. Below them is the constellation Coma Berenices. Above the head of Boötes is [[Quadrans Muralis]], now obsolete.]]
Illustrations of Boötes traditionally represent him as a herdsman with a club or staff, holding two hunting dogs on a leash and following [[Ursa Major]] around the pole.
[[File:Bootes constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|160px|right|Diagram of [[H.A. Rey]]'s alternative method of connecting the stars of Boötes.]]
[[H.A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative way to visualize the herdsman, in which he is seated and smoking a [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Rey]], ''The Stars &amp;mdash; A New Way To See Them''.  Enlarged World-Wide Edition.  Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1997.  ISBN 0-395-24830-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The stars [[Epsilon Boötis|ε Boo]], [[Delta Boötis|δ Boo]], [[Mu Boötis|μ Boo]], [[Beta Boötis|β Boo]], [[Gamma Boötis|γ Boo]], [[Rho Boötis|ρ Boo]], and [[Sigma Boötis|σ Boo]] form the herdsman's head. In addition, the stars δ Boo, μ Boo, and β Boo may be seen to form a cap. The stars γ Boo, [[Lambda Boötis|λ Boo]], [[Theta Boötis|θ Boo]], and [[Kappa Boötis|κ Boo]] form the herdsman's pipe. Star γ Boo is of the third magnitude and would be the herdsman's mouth. Stars ε Boo, [[Zeta Boötis|ζ Boo]], and [[Arcturus|α Boo]] (Arcturus) form the herdsman's body. Star ε Boo is of the third magnitude whereas Arcturus is of magnitude zero. Stars α Boo, [[Eta Boötis|η Boo]] and [[Upsilon Boötis|υ Boo]] form the herdsman's leg, with η Boo being the knee. Finally, stars υ Boo and [[Tau Boötis|τ Boo]] form the herdsman's foot. Star η Boo is of the third magnitude.

Modern diagrammatic visualizations often depict Boötes as looking like a [[kite]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Polakis&quot;&gt;''e.g.'', Tom Polakis, &quot; [http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=7615 Celestial Portraits: Boötes and Corona Borealis],&quot; from ''Astronomy Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Boötes are located in three areas: the [[Purple Forbidden Enclosure]] (紫微垣 ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán'') and [[Heavenly Market Enclosure]] (天市垣 ''Tiān Shì Yuán'') (both included in the [[Three Enclosures]] (三垣, ''Sān Yuán'')), and the [[Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon of the East]] (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'').

==Namesakes==
The [[US Navy]] ship [[USS Bootes (AK-99)]] was named after the constellation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bernardino Ochino''' (1487–1564) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]].
[[Image:Ochino.jpg|thumb|right|Bernardino Ochino in an old engraving.]]
 {{POV-check|date=December 2007}}

==Biography==
Bernardino Ochino was born in [[Siena]] son of the barber Domenico Ochino, and at the age of 7 or 8 around 1504 was entrusted to the Minorite order of [[Franciscan]] Friars, then from 1510 he studied medicine at [[Perugia]].

===1534, transfer to the Capuchins===
At the age of 38, perhaps craving a stricter governance, Ochino transferred himself in 1534 to the newly-founded [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]].

He had already become famous for zeal and eloquence, and was the intimate friend of the [[Spain|Spaniard]] [[Juan de Valdés]], of [[Pietro Bembo]], [[Vittoria Colonna]], [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Pietro Martire]], [[Pietro Carnesecchi|Carnesecchi]], and others destined to incur the suspicion of [[Christian heresy|heresy]], either from the moderation of their characters or from the evangelical tincture of their [[theology]].

===1538, vicar-general of the Capuchin order===
In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order. In 1539, urged by [[Pietro Bembo]], he visited [[Venice]] and delivered a remarkable course of [[sermon]]s, showing a decided tendency to the [[doctrine]] of [[justification by faith]], which appears still more evidently in his ''Dialogues'' published the same year.  

He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment of the [[Inquisition]] in [[Rome]] in June 1542, at the instigation of Cardinal [[Pope Paul IV|Giovanni Pietro Carafa]], the first [[Grand Inquisitor]], and later Pope Paul IV. Ochino almost immediately received a citation to [[Rome]], and set out to obey it about the middle of August.  According to his own statement, he was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of [[Gasparo Contarini|Cardinal Contarini]], whom he found at [[Bologna]], dying of [[poison]] administered by the reactionary party.

===1542, escape to Geneva===
He turned aside to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and after some hesitation escaped across the [[Alps]] to [[Geneva]].  He was cordially received by [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and published within two years several volumes of ''Prediche'', controversial tracts rather than sermons, explaining and vindicating his change of [[religion]].  He also addressed replies to marchioness [[Vittoria Colonna]], [[Claudio Tolomei]], and other Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself. His own breach with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was decisive and irreparable.

===1545-1547, Augsburg===
In 1545 he became minister of the Italian Protestant congregation at [[Augsburg]]. From this time dates his contact with [[Caspar Schwenckfeld]]. He was compelled to leave forsake when, in January 1547, the city was occupied by the imperial forces for the [[Diet of Augsburg]].

===1547-1553, Edward VI's England===
He found an asylum in [[England]], where he was made a [[prebendary]] of [[Canterbury]], received a [[pension]] from [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI's]] privy purse, and composed his capital work, the ''Tragoedie or Dialoge of the unjuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of Rome''. This remarkable text, originally written in [[Latin]], is extant only in the 1549 translation of Bishop [[John Ponet]].

The conception is highly dramatic; the form is that of a series of dialogues.  [[Lucifer]], enraged at the spread of [[Jesus]]' kingdom, convokes the fiends in council, and resolves to set up the [[pope]] as [[antichrist]].  The state, represented by the emperor [[Phocas]], is persuaded to connive at the [[pope]]'s assumption of spiritual authority; the other churches are intimidated into acquiescence; Lucifer's projects seem fully accomplished, when [[Heaven]] raises up [[Henry VIII of England]] and his son for their overthrow.  The conception bears a remarkable resemblance to that of ''Paradise Lost''; and it is nearly certain that [[John Milton|Milton]], whose sympathies with the Italian Reformation were so strong, must have been acquainted with it.  

Several of Ochino's ''Prediche'' were also translated into English by a lady, [[Anna Cooke]],&lt;ref&gt;or Anne Cooke b.1533&lt;/ref&gt; afterwards second wife of Sir [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]]; and he published numerous controversial treatises on the Continent.

===1553-1663, pastor at Zürich===
In 1553 the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] drove Ochino, and hundreds of other European exiles, from England. He went to Basel, where [[Lelio Sozzini]] and the lawyer [[Martino Muralto]] were sent to secure Ochino as pastor of the Italian church at Zürich, which Ochino accepted. The Italian congregation at [[Zürich]] was composed principally of refugees from [[Locarno]]. There for 10 years Ochino continued to write books which, repeating the history of his early works, gave increasing evidence of his alienation from the strict [[orthodoxy]] around him.  The most important of these was the ''Labyrinth'', a discussion of the [[free will|freedom of the will]], covertly assailing the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] doctrine of [[predestination]].

In 1563 the long-gathering storm of slander burst upon the occasion of the publication of his ''Thirty Dialogues'', in one of which his adversaries maintained that he had justified [[polygamy]] under colour of a pretended refutation.  His dialogues on [[divorce]] and against the [[Trinity]] were also considered obnoxious.

===Poland, and death===
Ochino was not given opportunity to defend himself, and banished from Zürich. After being refused a shelter by other Protestant cities, he directed his steps towards [[Poland]], at that time the most tolerant state in [[Europe]].  He had not resided there long when an edict appeared (August 8, 1564) banishing all foreign [[dissident]]s.  Fleeing the country, he encountered the [[Black Death|plague]] at [[Pińczów]]; three of his four children were carried off; and he himself, worn out by misfortune, expired in solitude and obscurity at [[Slavkov u Brna|Slavkov]] in [[Moravia]], about the end of 1564.

==Legacy==
His reputation among Protestants was at the time so bad that he was charged by [[Thomas Browne]] in 1643&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ce monstre d'homme, ce secrétaire de l'enfer, en un mot, l'auteur de l'abominable livre des trois imposteurs&quot; (Thomas Browne, Religio medici, 1643, 1e partie, section 19. Cité par Georges Minois, Le Traité des trois imposteurs, Albin Michel, 2009, p. 85 et p. 310, n. 35.)&lt;/ref&gt; with the authorship of the legendary-apocryphal heretical treatise ''[[The Treatise of the Three Impostors|De tribus Impostoribus]]'', as well as with having carried his alleged approval of polygamy into practice.

It was reserved for his biographer [[Karl Benrath]] to justify him, and to represent him as a fervent [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and at the same time as a speculative thinker with a passion for free inquiry, always learning and unlearning and arguing out difficult questions with himself in his dialogues, frequently without attaining to any absolute conviction.  The general tendency of his mind, nevertheless, was counter to tradition, and he is remarkable as resuming in his individual history all the phases of Protestant theology from Luther to [[Fausto Sozzini]].  He is especially interesting in relation to English Reformation literature for his residence in England, and the probable influence of more than one of his writings upon [[John Milton|Milton]].

The '''Bay of Quinte''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkwɪnti|pron}}) is a long, thin bay shaped like the letter &quot;Z&quot; on the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]] in the province of [[Ontario]], Canada. It is close to the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] that connects the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It is located about 200 kilometers east of [[Toronto]] and 400 west of [[Montreal]].

The name &quot;Quinte&quot; is derived from &quot;''Kente''&quot;, which was the name of an early French Catholic [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] located on the south shore of what is now [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/ontario/lake_ontario/cul_page3.htm Great Canadian Lakes, Lake Ontario - Saving Souls in Kente] Retrieved: 2010-04-15&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Bay, as it is known locally, provides some of the best trophy [[Walleye]] angling in North America as well as most sport fish common to the great lakes.  The bay is subject to [[algae bloom]]s in late summer which are a naturally occurring phenomenon and do not indicate pollution other than from agricultural runoff.  [[Zebra mussel]]s as well as the other invasive species found in the great lakes are present.

The Quinte area played a vital role to bootleggers during [[Prohibition in the United States]], with large volumes of booze being produced in the area, and shipped via boat on the Bay to [[Lake Ontario]] finally arriving in New York State where it was distributed.  Illegal sales of liquor accounted for many fortunes in and around [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]].

Tourism in the area is significant, especially in the summer months due to the Bay of Quinte and its fishing, local golf courses, provincial parks, and wineries.

==Geography==
[[File:BayofQuinteMap-1108.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Map of the Bay of Quinte Area]]
The northern side of the bay is defined by Ontario's mainland, while the southern side follows the shore of the Prince Edward County headland. Beginning in the east with the outlet to Lake Ontario, the bay runs west-southwest for {{km to mi|25}} to [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] (although this section is also called Adolphus Reach), where it turns north-northwest for another {{km to mi|20}} as far as [[Deseronto, Ontario|Deseronto]]. From there it turns south-southwest again for another {{km to mi|40}}, running past [[Big Island (Bay of Quinte)|Big Island]] on the south and [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on the north. The width of the bay rarely exceeds two kilometers. The bay ends at [[Trenton, Ontario|Trenton]] ([[Quinte West, Ontario|Quinte West]]) and the [[Trent River (Ontario)|Trent River]], both also on the north side. The [[Murray Canal]] has been cut through the few miles separating the end of the bay and Lake Ontario on the west side. The Trent River is part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], a canal connecting Lake Ontario to [[Lake Simcoe]] and then [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]].

There are several sub-bays off the Bay of Quinte, including Hay Bay, Big Bay, and Muscote Bay.

==Quinte Region==
'''Quinte''' is also a region comprising several communities situated along the Bay of Quinte, including [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] which is the largest city in the Quinte Region, and represents a mid-point between [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Toronto]].

The Greater Bay of Quinte area includes the municipalities of Brighton, Quinte West, Belleville, Prince Edward County, and Greater Napanee as well as the Native Mohawk Territory of Tyendinaga.  Overall population of the area exceeds 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quintedevelopment.com/v2/assets/File/Population%202006.pdf Demographics of the greater Bay of Quinte region] Retrieved: 2010-04-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bassoon''' is a [[woodwind instrument]] in the [[double reed]] family that typically plays music written in the [[Bass (music)|bass]] and [[tenor]] registers, and occasionally higher. Appearing in its modern form in the 19th century, the bassoon figures prominently in [[orchestra]]l, [[concert band]], and [[chamber music]] literature. The bassoon is a non-[[transposing instrument]] known for its distinctive tone color, wide range, variety of character, and agility. Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy [[timbre]] to that of a male [[baritone]] voice.

==Construction and range==
[[File:Fagott-Bassoon.svg|thumb|left|upright|Parts of the bassoon]]
[[File:Range bassoon.svg|thumb|[[Range (music)|Playing range]] of a bassoon&lt;br /&gt;({{Audio|Bassoon-technical-range.ogg|listen}})]]
[[File:Bassoon-octaves-spectrogram.png|thumb|A [[spectrogram]] of the bassoon's B{{Music|b}} in four [[octave]]s.]]

The bassoon disassembles into six main pieces, including the reed. The bell &lt;font color=red&gt;(6)&lt;/font&gt;, extending upward; the bass joint (or long joint) &lt;font color=red&gt;(5)&lt;/font&gt;, connecting the bell and the boot; the boot (or butt) &lt;font color=red&gt;(4)&lt;/font&gt;, at the bottom of the instrument and folding over on itself; the wing joint &lt;font color=red&gt;(3)&lt;/font&gt;, which extends from boot to bocal; and the [[bocal]] (or crook) &lt;font color=red&gt;(2)&lt;/font&gt;, a crooked metal tube that attaches the wing joint to a reed &lt;font color=red&gt;(1)&lt;/font&gt; ({{Audio|Bassoon-technical-reed.ogg|listen}}). Bassoons are double reed instruments like the oboe and the English horn.

The modern bassoon is generally made of [[maple]], or plastic for beginners, with medium-hardness types such as [[sycamore maple]] and [[sugar maple]] preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of materials such as [[polypropylene]] and [[ebonite]], primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons were made in the past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected at the bottom of the instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also [[stain]]ed and [[varnish]]ed. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or [[ivory]]. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.

Folded upon itself, the bassoon stands 1.34 m (4.4&amp;nbsp;feet) tall, but the total sounding length is 2.54 m (roughly 8.3 feet). Playing is facilitated by doubling the tube back on itself and by closing the distance between the widely spaced holes with a complex system of key work, which extends throughout nearly the entire length of the instrument. There are also short-reach bassoons made for the benefit of young or petite players.

The range of the bassoon begins at B-flat&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (the first one below the bass staff) and extends upward over three octaves (roughly to the G above the treble staff).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfg.woodwind.org/bassoon/basn_alt_3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Higher notes are possible but difficult to produce and rarely called for; orchestral parts rarely go higher than the C or D; even [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s famously difficult opening solo in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' only ascends to the High D. Low A at the bottom of the range is possible with a special extension to the instrument—see &quot;Extended Techniques&quot; below.

==Development==
===Early history===
[[File:Praetorius bassoons.jpg|thumb|Dulcians and [[rackett]]s, from the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]].]]
Music historians generally consider the [[dulcian]] to be the forerunner of the modern bassoon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Music: The Listener's Companion |last=Morin |first=Alexander J. |coauthors=Harold C. Schonberg |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |location=San Francisco |isbn= |page=1154 }}. &quot;Its direct ancestor is the dulcian, a hairpin-shaped instrument with a long, folded bore and a single key; developed in the first half of the 16th ceentury, it remained in use until the 17th.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as the two instruments share many characteristics: a double reed fitted to a metal crook, obliquely drilled [[tone hole]]s, and a [[Bore (wind instruments)|conical bore]] that doubles back on itself. The origins of the dulcian are obscure, but by the mid-16th century it was available in as many as eight different sizes, from [[soprano]] to great bass. A full consort of dulcians was a rarity; its primary function seems to have been to provide the bass in the typical wind band of the time, either loud ([[shawm]]s) or soft ([[recorder]]s), indicating a remarkable ability to vary [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] to suit the need. Otherwise, dulcian technique was rather primitive, with eight finger holes and generally one key, indicating that it could play in only a limited number of key signatures.

The dulcian came to be known as ''fagotto'' in Italy. However, the usual etymology that equates ''fagotto'' with &quot;[[Faggot (wood)|bundle of sticks]]&quot; is somewhat misleading, as the latter term did not come into general use until later. Some think it may resemble the Roman Facis, a standard of bound sticks with an ax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cache.eb.com/eb/image?id=95620&amp;rendTypeId=4 Facis Image]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; A further discrepancy lies in the fact that the dulcian was carved out of a single block of wood—in other words, a single &quot;stick&quot; and not a bundle.

Circumstantial evidence indicates that the baroque bassoon was a newly invented instrument, rather than a simple modification of the old dulcian. The dulcian was not immediately supplanted, but continued to be used well into the 18th century by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and others. The man most likely responsible for developing the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have invented the three-piece ''flûte traversière'' and the [[Oboe#Baroque|''hautbois'']]. Some historians believe that sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre conceived the bassoon in four sections (bell, bass joint, boot and wing joint), an arrangement that allowed greater accuracy in machining the bore compared to the one-piece dulcian. He also extended the compass down to [[B♭ (musical note)|B{{Music|b}}]] by adding two [[Key (instrument)|keys]].&lt;ref&gt;Lange and Thomson, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate view maintains Hotteterre was one of several craftsmen responsible for the development of the early bassoon. These may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other French makers active around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Kopp, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of [[Johann Christoph Denner]] and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key ([[G♯ (musical note)|G♯]]) was added, and it was for this type of instrument that composers such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]], Bach, and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low E{{Music|b}}, was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c. 1678–1769), J. Poerschmann (1680–1757), [[Thomas Stanesby|Thomas Stanesby, Jr]]. (1668–1734), G.H. Scherer (1703–1778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732–1786).

===Modern history===
Increasing demands on capabilities of instruments and players in the 19th century&amp;mdash;particularly larger concert halls requiring greater volume and the rise of virtuoso composer-performers&amp;mdash;spurred further refinement. Increased sophistication, both in manufacturing techniques and acoustical knowledge, made possible great improvements in the instrument's playability.

The modern bassoon exists in two distinct primary forms, the Buffet system and the Heckel system. Most of the world plays the Heckel system, while the Buffet system is primarily played in France, Belgium, and parts of [[Latin America]].

====Heckel (German) system====
[[File:Bassoon 1870.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Adam Heckel|Heckel]] system bassoon from 1870]]
The design of the modern bassoon owes a great deal to the performer, teacher, and composer [[Carl Almenräder]]. Assisted by the German acoustic researcher [[Gottfried Weber]], he developed the 17-key bassoon with a range spanning four [[octave]]s. Almenräder's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise describing ways of improving [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], response, and technical ease of playing by augmenting and rearranging the keywork. Subsequent articles further developed his ideas. Working at the Schott factory gave him the means to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, and he published the results in ''Caecilia'', Schott's house journal. Almenräder continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of the papers. In 1831, Almenräder left Schott to start his own factory with a partner, [[Johann Adam Heckel]].

Heckel and two generations of descendants continued to refine the bassoon, and their instruments became the standard other makers followed. Because of their superior singing tone quality (an improvement upon one of the main drawbacks of the Almenräder instruments), the Heckel instruments competed for prominence with the reformed Wiener system, a [[Boehm System|Boehm]]-style bassoon, and a completely keyed instrument devised by [[Charles-Joseph Sax]], father of [[Adolphe Sax]]. F.W. Kruspe implemented a latecomer attempt in 1893 to reform the fingering system, but it failed to catch on. Other attempts to improve the instrument included a 24-keyed model and a single-reed [[Mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]], but both these had adverse effects on tone and were abandoned.

Coming into the 20th century, the Heckel-style German model of bassoon dominated the field. Heckel himself had made over 1,100 instruments by the turn of the 20th century (serial numbers begin at 3,000), and the British makers' instruments were no longer desirable for the changing [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] requirements of the symphony orchestra, remaining primarily in [[military band]] use.

Except for a brief 1940s wartime conversion to [[ball bearing]] manufacture, the Heckel concern has produced instruments continuously to the present day. Heckel bassoons are considered by many the best, although a range of Heckel-style instruments is available from several other manufacturers, all with slightly different playing characteristics. Companies that manufacture Heckel-system bassoons include: [[Wilhelm Heckel GmbH|Wilhelm Heckel]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], Fox Products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxproducts.com/ Fox Products]&lt;/ref&gt; W. Schreiber &amp; Söhne, Püchner,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puchner.com/ Püchner]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Selmer Company]], Linton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lintonwoodwinds.com/ Linton]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosmann&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b-moosmann.de/ Moosmann]&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlert, Moennig/Adler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moennig-adler.de/ Moennig/Adler]&lt;/ref&gt; B.H. Bell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellbassoons.com/ B.H. Bell]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guntram Wolf]]. In addition, several factories in the People's Republic of China are producing inexpensive instruments under such labels as Laval, Haydn, and Lark, and these have been available in the West for some time now. However, they are generally of marginal quality and are usually avoided by serious players.

Because its mechanism is primitive compared to most modern woodwinds, makers have occasionally attempted to &quot;reinvent&quot; the bassoon. In the 1960s, [[Giles Brindley]] began to develop what he called the &quot;logical bassoon,&quot; which aimed to improve intonation and evenness of tone through use of an electrically activated mechanism, making possible key combinations too complex for the human hand to manage. Brindley's logical bassoon was never marketed.

====Buffet (French) system====
The Buffet system bassoon achieved its basic acoustical properties somewhat earlier than the Heckel. Thereafter it continued to develop in a more conservative manner. While the early history of the Heckel bassoon included a complete overhaul of the instrument in both [[acoustics]] and keywork, the development of the Buffet system consisted primarily of incremental improvements to the keywork. This minimalist approach deprived the Buffet of the improved consistency, ease of operation, and increased power found in the Heckel bassoons, but the Buffet is considered by some to have a more vocal and expressive quality. The conductor [[John Foulds]] lamented in 1934 the dominance of the Heckel-style bassoon, considering them too homogeneous in sound with the [[horn (instrument)|horn]].

Compared to the Heckel bassoon, Buffet system bassoons have a narrower bore and simpler mechanism, requiring different fingerings for many notes. Switching between Heckel and Buffet requires extensive retraining. Buffet instruments are known for a reedier sound and greater facility in the [[Register (music)|upper registers]], reaching e&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with far greater ease and less air pressure. French woodwind tone in general exhibits a certain amount of &quot;edge,&quot; with more of a vocal quality than is usual elsewhere, and the Buffet bassoon is no exception. This type of sound can be beneficial in music by French composers, but has drawn criticism for being too intrusive. As with all bassoons, the tone varies considerably, depending on individual instrument and performer. In the hands of a lesser player, the Heckel bassoon can sound flat and woody, but good players succeed in producing a vibrant, singing tone. Conversely, a poorly played Buffet can sound buzzy and nasal, but good players succeed in producing a warm, expressive sound, different from&amp;mdash;but not inferior to&amp;mdash;the Heckel.

Though the United Kingdom once favored the French system,&lt;ref&gt;Langwill, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Buffet-system instruments are no longer made there and the last prominent British player of the French system retired in the 1980s. However, with continued use in some regions and its distinctive tone, the Buffet continues to have a place in modern bassoon playing, particularly in France. Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by [[Buffet Crampon]] and The Selmer Company. Some players, for example the late Gerald Corey in Canada, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire.

==Use in ensembles==
===Earlier ensembles===
Orchestras first used the bassoon to reinforce the bass line, and as the bass of the double reed choir ([[oboe]]s and taille). Baroque composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and his ''Les Petits Violons'' included oboes and bassoons along with the strings in the 16-piece (later 21-piece) ensemble, as one of the first orchestras to include the newly invented double reeds. [[Antonio Cesti]] included a bassoon in his 1668 opera ''Il Pomo d'oro'' (The Golden Apple). However, use of bassoons in concert orchestras was sporadic until the late 17th century when double reeds began to make their way into standard instrumentation. This was largely due to the spread of the ''hautbois'' to countries outside of France. Increasing use of the bassoon as a ''[[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]'' instrument meant that it began to be included in [[opera]] orchestras, first in France and later in Italy, Germany and England. Meanwhile, composers such as [[Joseph Bodin de Boismortier]], [[Michel Corrette]], [[Johann Ernst Galliard]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Johann Friedrich Fasch]] and Telemann wrote demanding solo and ensemble music for the instrument. Antonio Vivaldi brought the bassoon to prominence by featuring it in 37 [[Concerto|concerti]] for the instrument.

By the mid-18th century, the bassoon's function in the orchestra was still mostly limited to that of a continuo instrument—since scores often made no specific mention of the bassoon, its use was implied, particularly if there were parts for oboes or other winds. Beginning in the early [[Rococo]] era, composers such as [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]] and [[Johann Stamitz]] included parts that exploited the bassoon for its unique color, rather than for its perfunctory ability to double the bass line. Orchestral works with fully independent parts for the bassoon would not become commonplace until the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s &quot;[[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Jupiter]]&quot; symphony is a prime example, with its famous bassoon solos in the first [[Movement (music)|movement]]. The bassoons were generally paired, as in current practice, though the famed [[Mannheim school|Mannheim orchestra]] boasted four.

Another important use of the bassoon during the Classical era was in the ''[[Harmonie]]'', a chamber ensemble consisting of pairs of oboes, horns and bassoons; later, two clarinets would be added to form an octet. The ''Harmonie'' was an ensemble maintained by German and Austrian noblemen for private music-making, and was a cost-effective alternative to a full orchestra. Haydn, Mozart, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Krommer]] all wrote considerable amounts of music for the ''Harmonie''.

===Modern ensembles===
The modern symphony orchestra typically calls for two bassoons, often with a third playing the [[contrabassoon]]. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''. Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous running line (doubled in the [[viola]]s and [[cello]]s) in the overture to ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and [[double bass]]es, and [[harmonic]] support along with the French horns.

A wind ensemble will usually also include two bassoons and sometimes contra, each with independent parts; other types of concert wind ensembles will often have larger sections, with many players on each of first or second parts; in simpler arrangements there will be only one bassoon part and no contra. The bassoon's role in the wind band is similar to its role in the orchestra, though when scoring is thick it often cannot be heard above the brass instruments also in its range. ''La Fiesta Mexicana'', by [[H. Owen Reed]], features the instrument prominently, as does the transcription of [[Malcolm Arnold]]'s ''Four Scottish Dances'', which has become a staple of the concert band repertoire.

The bassoon is also part of the standard [[wind quintet]] instrumentation, along with the flute, oboe, clarinet, and horn; it is also frequently combined in various ways with other woodwinds. [[Richard Strauss]]'s &quot;Duet-Concertino&quot; pairs it with the clarinet as ''concertante'' instruments, with string orchestra in support.

The bassoon quartet has also gained favor in recent times. The bassoon's wide range and variety of tone colors make it ideally suited to grouping in like-instrument ensembles. [[Peter Schickele]]'s &quot;Last Tango in Bayreuth&quot; (after themes from ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'') is a popular work; Schickele's fictional alter ego [[P. D. Q. Bach]] exploits the more humorous aspects with his quartet &quot;Lip My Reeds,&quot; which at one point calls for players to perform on the reed alone. It also calls for a low [[A (musical note)|A]] at the very end of the prelude section in the fourth bassoon part. It is written so that the first bassoon does not play; instead, his or her role is to place an extension in the bell of the fourth bassoon so that the note can be played.

===Jazz===
The bassoon is infrequently used as a [[jazz]] instrument and rarely seen in a [[Jazz band|jazz ensemble]]. It first began appearing in the 1920s, including specific calls for its use in [[Paul Whiteman]]'s group, the unusual Octets of [[Alec Wilder]], and a few other session appearances. The next few decades saw the instrument used only sporadically, as symphonic jazz fell out of favor, but the 1960s saw artists such as [[Yusef Lateef]] and [[Chick Corea]] incorporate bassoon into their recordings; Lateef's diverse and eclectic instrumentation saw the bassoon as a natural addition, while Corea employed the bassoon in combination with [[flautist]] [[Hubert Laws]].

More recently, [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Ray Pizzi]], [[Frank Tiberi]], and [[Marshall Allen]] have both doubled on bassoon in addition to their saxophone performances. Bassoonist [[Karen Borca]], a performer of [[free jazz]], is one of the few jazz musicians to play only bassoon; [[Michael Rabinowitz]], the Spanish bassoonist [[Javier Abad]], and [[James Lassen]], an American resident in [[Bergen]], Norway, are others. [[Katherine Young (musician)|Katherine Young]] plays the bassoon in the ensembles of [[Anthony Braxton]]. [[Lindsay Cooper]], [[Paul Hanson]], the [[Brazil]]ian bassoonist [[Alexandre Silverio]], and [[Daniel Smith (bassoonist)|Daniel Smith]] are also currently using the bassoon in jazz. French bassoonists [[Jean-Jacques Decreux]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrs.org/Publications/DR/DR15.1/DR15.1.Klimko.CD.PDF Review of the CD &quot;FAAA.&quot; International Double Reed Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexandre Ouzounoff]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://idrs.colorado.edu/Publications/DR/DR12.2/DR12.2.Bassoon.RecRev.html#anchor369603 Review of the LP &quot;Palisander's Night.&quot; International Double Reed Society. The Double Reed, Vol. 12, No. 2 Fall 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; have both recorded jazz, exploiting the flexibility of the Buffet system instrument to good effect.

===Popular music===
The bassoon is even rarer as a regular member of rock bands. However, several 1960s pop music hits feature the bassoon, including &quot;[[The Tears of a Clown]]&quot; by [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], &quot;[[Jennifer Juniper]]&quot; by [[Donovan]], &quot;[[The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)|59th Street Bridge Song]]&quot; by [[Harpers Bizarre]], and the oompah bassoon underlying [[The New Vaudeville Band]]'s &quot;[[Winchester Cathedral (song)|Winchester Cathedral]]&quot;. From 1968 to 1978, the bassoon was played by Lindsay Cooper in the British [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde band]] [[Henry Cow]], and in the 1970s it was used by the British medieval/[[progressive rock]] band [[Gryphon (band)|Gryphon]] (played by Brian Gulland) as well as by the American band [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]] (played by drummer Burleigh Drummond). The Belgian [[Rock in Opposition]]-band [[Univers Zero]] is also known for they use of the bassoon.

In the 1990s, [[Madonna Wayne Gacy]] provided bassoon for the alternative metal band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] as did Aimee DeFoe, in what is self-described as &quot;grouchily lilting garage bassoon&quot; in the indie-rock band [[Blogurt]] from [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogurt.com Blogurt, official website]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[These New Puritans]]'s 2010 album [[Hidden (album)|Hidden]] makes heavy use of the instrument throughout; their principal songwriter, Jack Barnett, claimed repeatedly to be ''&quot;writing a lot of music for bassoon&quot;'' in the run-up to its recording.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/xbd3&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2011, American [[hip-hop]] artist [[Kanye West]] updated his [[Twitter]] account to inform followers that he recently added the bassoon to an as-of-yet unnamed song.&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/29295326921756672&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock band [[Better Than Ezra]] took their name from a passage in [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'' in which the author comments that listening to an annoyingly talkative person is still “better than Ezra learning how to play the bassoon,” referring to [[Ezra Pound]].

==Technique==
[[File:Bassoon2 (PSF).jpg|left|150px|alt=Female bassoon player]]
The bassoon is held diagonally in front of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be supported by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is required; the most common ones used are 1) a seat strap attached to the base of the boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or 2) a neck strap or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a ''balance hanger'' is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity.

The bassoon is played with both hands in a stationary position, the left above the right, with five main finger holes on the front of the instrument (nearest the audience) plus a sixth that is activated by an open-standing key. Five additional keys on the front are controlled by the little fingers of each hand. The back of the instrument (nearest the player) has twelve or more keys to be controlled by the thumbs, the exact number varying depending on model.

To stabilize the right hand, many bassoonists use an adjustable comma-shaped apparatus called a &quot;crutch,&quot; or a hand rest, which mounts to the boot joint. The crutch is secured with a thumb screw, which also allows the distance that it protrudes from the bassoon to be adjusted. Players rest the curve of the right hand where the thumb joins the palm against the crutch. The crutch also keeps the right hand from tiring and enables the player to keep the finger pads flat on the finger holes and keys.

An aspect of bassoon technique not found on any other woodwind is called ''flicking''. It involves the left hand thumb momentarily pressing, or 'flicking' the high A, [[C (musical note)|C]] and [[D (musical note)|D]] keys at the beginning of certain notes in the middle octave. This eliminates cracking, or brief [[multiphonics]] that happens without the use of this technique.

Flicking is not universal amongst bassoonists; some American players, principally on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], use it sparingly, if at all. The rest use it virtually 100% of the time—it has become in essence part of the fingering.

The alternative method is &quot;venting&quot;, which requires that the register key be used as part of the full fingering as opposed to being open momentarily at the start of the note.

A new automatic octave key system is available as an add-on, invented by [[Arthur Weisberg]]. When installed, the Weisberg system completely eliminates the need to 'flick' in the upper octave. Only a few years old, it has yet to be offered as standard equipment by any of the major bassoon manufacturers.

While bassoons are usually critically tuned at the factory, the player nonetheless has a great degree of flexibility of pitch control through the use of breath support and [[embouchure]] and reed profile. Players can also use alternate fingerings to adjust the pitch of many notes.
&lt;!--labeled keywork picture goes here--&gt;

===Embouchure===
The bassoon [[embouchure]] is a very important aspect of producing a full, round bassoon tone, but can be difficult to obtain as a beginner. Since the bassoon is not a common concert instrument, like [[clarinet]] or [[trumpet]], many band directors do not understand the bassoon embouchure, leaving the bassoon students to basically &quot;create their own&quot; embouchure. The bassoon embouchure is made by putting your lips together as if you were whistling and then dropping your jaw down as if you were yawning (don't actually yawn or open your mouth), while keeping your throat open.

===Extended techniques===
Many extended techniques can be performed on the bassoon, such as [[multiphonics]], [[flutter-tonguing]], [[circular breathing]], [[tonguing|double tonguing]], and harmonics. In the case of the bassoon, flutter-tonguing may be accomplished by &quot;gargling&quot; in the back of the throat as well as by the conventional method of rolling Rs.

Also, using certain fingerings, notes may be produced on the instrument that sound lower pitches than the actual range of the instrument. These &quot;impossible notes&quot; tend to sound very gravelly and out of tune, but technically sound below the low B{{Music|b}}. Alternatively, lower notes can be produced by inserting a small paper or rubber tube into the end of the bell, which converts the lower B{{Music|b}} into a lower note such as an A natural; this lowers the pitch of the instrument, but has the positive effect of bringing the lowest register (which is typically quite sharp) into tune. A notable piece that calls for the use of a low A bell is [[Carl Nielsen]]'s [[Wind Quintet (Nielsen)|Wind Quintet]], op. 43, which includes an optional low A for the final cadence of the work. Bassoonists sometimes use the end bell segment of an [[Cor anglais (English horn)|English horn]] or [[clarinet]] if one is available instead of a specially made extension. This often yields unsatisfactory results, though, as the resultant A can be quite sharp. The idea of using low A was begun by [[Richard Wagner]], who wanted to extend the range of the bassoon. Many passages in his later operas require the low A as well as the B-flat above. (This is impossible on a normal bassoon using an A extension as the fingering for the B-flat yields the low A.) These passages are typically realized on the contrabassoon, as recommended by the composer. Some bassoons have been made to allow bassoonists to realize similar passages. These bassoons are made with a &quot;Wagner bell,&quot; which is an extended bell with a key for both the low A and the low B-flat. Bassoons with Wagner bells suffer similar intonational deficiencies as a bassoon with an A extension. Another composer who has required the bassoon to be chromatic down to low A is [[Gustav Mahler]].

===Learning the bassoon===
The complicated [[fingering]] and the problem of [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]] make the bassoon more difficult to learn than some of the other woodwind instruments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idrs.org/Publications/DR/DR4.2/few.html — Paragraph 7&lt;/ref&gt; Cost is another factor in a person's decision to pursue the bassoon. Prices range from $8,000 up to $25,000 for a quality instrument.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_a_qualitiy_bassoon_cost&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, schoolchildren typically take up bassoon only after starting on another reed instrument, such as [[clarinet]] or [[saxophone]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Z. Powell (1950) ''This is an Orchestra'' Houghton Mifflin, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reeds and reed construction==
===Modern reeds===
[[File:Bassoon-reeds2.jpg|thumb|[[Reed (instrument)|Bassoon reeds]] are usually around {{convert|5.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length and wrapped in thread.]]
[[File:Bassoon reed binding.jpg|thumb|Detail of binding around base of reed.]]
[[Reed (instrument)|Bassoon reeds]], made of ''[[Arundo donax]]'' cane, are often made by the players themselves, although beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces. The cane is then trimmed and ''gouged'' to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or ''profile'', by removing material from the bark side. This can be done by hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel [[mandrel]] (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the &quot;throat,&quot; and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.

After the reed has dried, the wires are tightened around the reed, which has shrunk after drying. The lower part is sealed (a [[nitrocellulose]]-based cement such as Duco may be used) and then wrapped with thread to ensure both that no air leaks out through the bottom of the reed and that the reed maintains its shape. The wrapping itself is often sealed with Duco or clear nail varnish (polish). The bulge in the wrapping is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Turk's head&quot;—it serves as a convenient handle when inserting the reed on the bocal.

To finish the reed, the end of the reed blank, originally at the center of the unfolded piece of cane, is cut off, creating an opening. The blades above the first wire are now roughly {{convert|27|-|30|mm|abbr=on}} long. For the reed to play, a slight bevel must be created at the tip with a knife, although there is also a machine that can perform this function. Other adjustments with the knife may be necessary, depending on the hardness and profile of the cane and the requirements of the player. The reed opening may also need to be adjusted by squeezing either the first or second wire with the pliers. Additional material may be removed from the sides (the &quot;channels&quot;) or tip to balance the reed. Additionally, if the &quot;e&quot; in the staff is sagging in pitch, it may be necessary to &quot;clip&quot; the reed by removing {{convert|1|-|2|mm|abbr=on}} from its length.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin and Glickman, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKay, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing styles of individual bassoonists vary greatly; because of this, most advanced players will make their own reeds, in the process customizing them to their individual playing requirements. Many companies and individuals do offer reeds for sale, but even with store-bought reeds, the player must know how to make adjustments to suit his particular playing style.

===Early reeds===
Little is known about the early construction of the bassoon reed, as few examples survive, and much of what is known is only what can be gathered from artistic representations. The earliest known written instructions date from the middle of the 17th century, describing the reed as being held together by wire or resined thread; the earliest actual reeds that survive are more than a century younger, a collection of 21 reeds from the late 18th century Spanish ''bajon''.

'''Bipedalism''' is a form of [[terrestrial locomotion]] where an organism [[Motion (physics)|moves]] by means of its two rear [[limbs]], or [[legs]]. An [[animal]] or [[machine]] that usually moves in a '''bipedal''' manner is known as a '''biped''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|aɪ|p|ɛ|d}}), meaning &quot;two feet&quot; (from the [[Latin]] ''bi'' for &quot;two&quot; and ''ped'' for &quot;foot&quot;). Types of bipedal movement include [[walking]], [[running]], or [[jumping|hopping]], on two [[appendage]]s (typically [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]]).

Relatively few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. Within [[mammal]]s, habitual bipedalism has evolved four times, with the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, [[Kangaroo mouse|kangaroo mice]], [[springhare]] &lt;ref&gt;NC Heglund, GA Cavagna and CR Taylor
 1982 Energetics and mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. III. Energy changes of the centre of mass as a function of speed and body size in birds and mammals Journal of Experimental Biology 97:1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hominina]]n apes. In the [[Triassic]] period some groups of [[archosaur]]s (a group that includes the  ancestors of [[crocodile]]s) developed bipedalism; among their descendants the [[dinosaur]]s all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the [[bird]]s descended from one group of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs.

A larger number of modern species are capable of bipedal movement for a short time in exceptional circumstances. Several non-archosaurian [[lizard]] species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. A few animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.

There are two main types of bipedal locomotion: [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, some smaller birds{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;!--Don't cuckoos and parrots, to name just two, move each leg independently?--&gt;, and [[Heteromyidae|heteromyid rodents]] move by hopping on both legs simultaneously; other groups, including apes and larger birds, walk or run by moving one leg at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philosophistry.com/static/bipedalism.html | last = Dhingra | first = Philip | title = Comparative bipedalism:  How the rest of the animal kingdom walks on two legs | date=  2004-05-25 | accessdate = 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Bipedalism, involving the exclusive use of two legs for locomotion, has evolved multiple times independently among [[vertebrate]]s. Within [[mammal]]s, exclusive bipedalism has evolved four times, with the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, springhares, [[Kangaroo mouse|kangaroo mice]] and [[ape]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; In [[reptile]]s, it evolved once with the [[archosaur]]s, ancestors to [[crocodile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[dinosaur]]s, and once with the [[lizard]]s such as the [[zebra-tailed lizard]].    Within these groups there is still variations in locomotion - in large birds and humans locomotion occurs through [[walking]] by alternating legs.  In comparison, macropods, smaller birds and kangaroo mice move through hopping on both legs simultaneously.
--&gt;

==Definition==
The word is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''bi(s)'' 'two (2)' and ''ped-'' 'foot', as contrasted with [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] 'four feet'.

===Facultative and obligate bipedalism===
Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as &quot;facultative&quot; (i.e. optional) or &quot;obligate&quot; (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut - for example humans normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary. There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases are a result of conditions such as [[Uner Tan syndrome]] - very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumphreyEtAl2005HumanHandWalkers&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf | title=Human Hand-Walkers: Five Siblings Who Never Stood Up | author=Humphrey, N., Skoyles, J.R., and Keynes, R. | publisher=Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London School of Economics | year=2005 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that &quot;normal&quot; humans can crawl on hands and knees. This article therefore avoids the terms &quot;facultative&quot; and &quot;obligate&quot;, and focuses on  the range of styles of locomotion ''normally'' used by various groups of animals.

==Movement==
There are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism.

# [[Standing]]. Staying still on both legs. In most bipeds this is an active process, requiring constant adjustment of balance.
# [[Walking]]. One foot in front of another, with at least one foot on the ground at any time.
# [[Running]]. One foot in front of another, with periods where both feet are off the ground.
# [[Jumping]]/[[Hopping]]. Moving by a series of jumps with both feet moving together.

==Bipedal animals==
The great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds. Among mammals, bipedalism is a normal method of [[Animal locomotion|ground locomotion]] in various groups of [[primates]] (e.g. [[lemurs]], [[gibbon]]s and [[Hominina]]), in the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s (kangaroos, wallabies, etc.), and in a few groups of rodents, including [[kangaroo rat]]s and [[Kangaroo mouse|kangaroo mice]] in the family [[Heteromyidae]], as well as [[gerbils]] and [[spring hare]]s). All [[birds]] are bipeds when on the ground, a feature inherited from their [[dinosaur]] ancestors. Bipedalism evolved more than once in [[archosaurs]], the group that includes both dinosaurs and [[crocodilians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutchinson2006EvolutionOfLocomotionInArchosaurs&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | title=The evolution of locomotion in archosaurs | author=Hutchinson, J.R. | journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol | volume=5 | issue=3-4 | year=2006 | pages=519–530 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6X1G-4J6WP8M-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=ff4c612aef14e51e872112989be76277 | doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2005.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of [[lizards]] become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus ''[[Ctenosaura]]''). There are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians.

Most bipedal animals move with their backs close to horizontal, using a long tail to balance the weight of their bodies. The primate version of bipedalism is unusual because the back is close to upright (completely upright in humans) and, among primates that move bipedally, only the lemurs have tails.

Humans and large birds [[walking|walk]] by raising one foot at a time.  On the other hand most macropods, smaller birds and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously. [[Tree kangaroo]]s are able to utilize either form of locomotion, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground.

===Dinosaurs and other archosaurs===
All dinosaurs are believed to be descended from a fully bipedal ancestor, perhaps similar to ''[[Eoraptor]]''.  Bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other [[dinosaur]] lineages such as the [[iguanodon]]s. Some extinct members of the [[crocodilian]] line, a sister group to the dinosaurs and birds, also evolved bipedal forms - a [[crocodile]] relative from the [[triassic]], ''[[Effigia okeeffeae]]'', is believed to be bipedal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0125_060125_crocodile.html | title = Dino-Era Fossil Reveals Two-Footed Croc Relative | last = Handwerk | first = Brian | date=  2006-01-26 | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | publisher = [[National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pterosaur]]s were previously thought to have been bipedal, but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion.

===Mammals===
Bipedal movement is less common among [[mammal]]s, most of which are [[quadruped]]al. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though non-human primates primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the largest mammalian group using exclusive bipedal movement are the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), which move via hopping.  Other mammals also move via hopping, such as the [[kangaroo rat]],  [[springhare]] and certain primates such as the [[sifaka]] and [[sportive lemur]]. Possibly the only mammals other than primates that commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping is the [[ground pangolin]].

====Primates====
Primates can be distinguished from other quadrupedal mammals as they exhibit a greater diversity in locomotor behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;encylopediahumanevolution&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution | author=Fleagle, J.G | chapter=Primate locomotion and posture | editors=Steve Jones, Robert Martin &amp; David Pilbeam | year=1994 | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge |isbn=0-521-3270-3 | pages=75–79}} Also ISBN-0-521-46786-1 (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt; These include  [[arm swinging]] (brachiation), [[quadrumanous|quadrumanous climbing]], [[knuckle walking]], and regular short bouts of bipedalism. In addition, quadrupedal locomotion in primates also exhibits significant differences from other mammals. These differences in gait characteristics are primarily adaptations to an [[arboreal]] environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Primates that live in tropical areas often wade through water in a bipedal stance. Gorillas, bonobos, [[proboscis monkey]]s and baboons have been observed wading bipedally.Three captive primates, one macaque [[Natasha (monkey)|Natasha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5479501 | title = Monkey apes humans by walking on two legs | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | last = Waldman | first = Dan | date=  2004-07-21  | accessdate = 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two chimps, [[Oliver (chimpanzee)|Oliver]] and Poko (chimpanzee), were found to move bipedally.  Natasha switched to exclusive bipedalism after an illness, while Poko was discovered in captivity in a tall, narrow cage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue22/walkingtall.html University of Liverpool - Research Intelligence Issue 22 - Walking tall after all&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/04/functional_anatomy_part_i.php#more Tetrapod Zoology : Bipedal orangs, gait of a dinosaur, and new-look Ichthyostega: exciting times in functional anatomy part I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Oliver reverted to [[knuckle-walking]] after developing arthritis.

In addition, non-human primates often use bipedal locomotion when carrying food. One hypothesis for human bipedalism is thus that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival from carrying food to share with group members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/93519752/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Bipedality in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus): Testing hypotheses on the evolution of bipedalism]&lt;/ref&gt; although there are other hypotheses, as below.

===Limited bipedalism in mammals===
Other mammals engage in limited, non-locomotory, bipedalism. A number of other animals, such as [[rat]]s, [[racoon]]s, and [[beaver]]s will squat on their hindlegs to manipulate some objects but revert to four limbs when moving (the beaver may also move bipedally if transporting wood for their [[Beavers#Dams|dams]]).  [[Bear]]s will fight in a bipedal stance to use their forelegs as weapons.  [[Ground squirrel]]s and [[meerkat]]s will stand on hind legs to survey their surroundings, but will not walk bipedally.  [[Dog]]s can stand or move on two legs if trained, or if birth defect or injury precludes [[quadruped]]alism.  The [[gerenuk]] antelope stands on its hind legs while eating from trees, as did the extinct [[Megatherium|giant ground sloth]]  and [[chalicothere]]s.  The [[spotted skunk]] will also use limited bipedalism when threatened, rearing up on its forelimbs while facing the attacker so its [[anal glands]], capable of spraying an offensive oil, face its attacker.

===Limited bipedalism in non-mammals===
Bipedalism is unknown among the [[amphibian]]s. Among the non-[[archosaur]] [[reptile]]s bipedalism is rare, but it is found in the 'reared-up' running of [[lizard]]s such as [[Agamidae|agamids]] and [[monitor lizard]]s. Many reptile species will also temporarily adopt bipedalism while fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wildlifetimes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=601 | format = php | last = Sharma | first = Jayanth | title = The Story behind the Picture - Monitor Lizards Combat | date=  2007-03-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | publisher = Wildlife Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One genus of [[Basiliscus (genus)|basilisk lizard]] can run bipedally across the surface of water for some distance. [[Birds]] are also bipedal when not flying.  Among [[arthropod]]s, [[cockroach]]es are known to move bipedally at high speeds [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/joa/2004/00000204/00000005/art00002?crawler=true].  Bipedalism is virtually solely found in [[terrestrial animal]]s, though at least two types of [[octopus]] walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, allowing the remaining arms to be used to camouflage the octopus as a mat of algae or a floating coconut.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15790846&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huffard CL, Boneka F, Full RJ |title=Underwater bipedal locomotion by octopuses in disguise |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5717 |pages=1927 |year=2005 |pmid=15790846 |doi=10.1126/science.1109616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages.  Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths.  While upright, non-locomotory [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in giant pangolin), combat (in bears and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage (in certain species of octopus).  Running speeds can be increased when an animal lacks a flexible backbone, though the maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrapedal movement with a flexible backbone - the [[ostrich]] reaches speeds of {{convert|65|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the [[red kangaroo]] {{convert|70|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[cheetah]] can exceed {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name='Garland_1983_JZL'&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]]|first=T., Jr.|coauthors= |year=1983 |title=The relation between maximal running speed and body mass in terrestrial mammals| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1983_JZL.pdf |journal=Journal of Zoology, London |volume=199 |issue= |pages=157–170 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02087.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Recent evidence regarding modern human [[sexual dimorphism]] (physical differences between men and women) in the [[lumbar spine]] has been seen in pre-modern primates such as ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.  This dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during [[pregnancy]], an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make.&lt;ref&gt;The Independent's article [http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article3247561.ece A pregnant woman's spine is her flexible friend], by Steve Connor from The Independent (Published: 13 December 2007) quoting [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/anthropology/faculty/profiles/Shapiro/Liza/ Shapiro, Liza], University of Texas at Austin Dept. of Anthropology about her article, Whitcome, et al., [http://www.nature.com/news/2007/071212/full/news.2007.374.html Nature advance online publication, doi:10.1038/nature06342 (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071212-pregnancy-tips_2.html Why Pregnant Women Don't Tip Over.] Amitabh Avasthi for National Geographic News, December 12, 2007.  This article has good pictures explaining the differences between bipedal and non-bipedal pregnancy loads.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bipedalism has a number of adaptive advantages, and has evolved independently in a number of lineages.

===Early reptiles and lizards===
The first known biped is the [[bolosaurid]] ''[[Eudibamus]]'' whose fossils date from 290 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Upright lizard leaves dinosaur standing | date=  2000-11-03 | work = cnn.com | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031005956/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

This may have given increased speed. The species was extinct before the dinosaurs appeared.

Independent of ''Eudibamus'', some modern lizard species have developed the capacity to run on their hind legs for added speed.

===Dinosaurs and birds===
Bipedalism also evolved independently among the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs diverged from their [[archosaur]] ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late [[Triassic]] period, roughly 20 million years after the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 95% of all [life on Earth].&lt;ref&gt;Citation for Permian/Triassic extinction event, percentage of animal species that went extinct.

D36040612.&lt;/ref&gt; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sereno |first=Paul C. |authorlink= |coauthors=Catherine A.

===Mammals===
A number of mammals will adopt a bipedal stance in specific situations such as for feeding or fighting. A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans, [[giant pangolin]]s, the extinct [[Megatheriidae|giant ground sloths]], numerous species of jumping [[rodent]]s and [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied are documented in the next section. Macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burk 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burk |first=Angela |coauthors=Michael Westerman and Mark Springer |year=1988 |month=September |title=The Phylogenetic Position of the Musky Rat-Kangaroo and the Evolution of Bipedal Hopping in Kangaroos (Macropodidae: Diprotodontia) |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=457–474 |pmid=12066687 |url= |accessdate=2008-06-28 |quote= |doi=10.1080/106351598260824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humans===
{{Main|Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism}}
There are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lovejoy, C.O. |title=Evolution of Human walking |journal=Scientific American. |volume=259 |issue=5 |pages=82–89 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bipedal specializations are found in ''[[Australopithecus]]'' fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago &lt;ref name=&quot;evolutionthe1st4billionyears&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Evolution: The First Four Billion Years| author=McHenry, H.M | chapter=Human Evolution | editors=Michael Ruse &amp; Joseph Travis | year=2009 | publisher= The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03175-3 | page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still.

Possible reasons for the evolution of human bipedalism include freeing the hands for tool use and carrying, [[sexual dimorphism]] in food gathering, changes in climate and habitat (from [[jungle]] to [[savanna]]) and to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the tropical sun.  The first two explanations have been criticized {{By whom|date=October 2009}}  for projecting modern social concerns and prejudices onto ancestral species.  The latter two have been criticized for not making sense in the context of the forest and woodland [[biome]]s occupied by human ancestors.

====Traveling efficiency hypothesis====
An alternative explanation is the mixture of savanna and scattered forests increased terrestrial travel by proto-humans between clusters of trees, and bipedalism offered greater efficiency for long-distance travel between these clusters than quadrupedalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Isbell, L.A. and T.P. Young.   |title=The evolution of bipedalism in hominids and reduced group size in chimpanzees: alternative responses to decreasing resource availability. |journal=Journal of Human Evolution  |volume=30 |pages=289–297 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewin, Roger; Swisher, Carl Celso; Curtis, Garniss H. |title=Java man: how two geologists' dramatic discoveries changed our understanding of the evolutionary path to modern humans |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-684-80000-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postural feeding hypothesis====
The postural feeding hypothesis has been recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, a professor at Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they ate. While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was utilized by grabbing for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits because they were so convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt hypothesises that these movements coevolved with [[chimpanzee]] arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the ''[[Australopithecus]]'' hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to [[humans]]. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture. As Hunt says, “A bipedal postural feeding adaptation may have been a [[preadaptation]] for the fully realized locomotor bipedalism apparent in [[Homo erectus]].” {{cite}}

====Provisioning model====
One theory on the origin of bipedalism is the behavioral model presented by C. Owen Lovejoy, known as &quot;male provisioning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy theorizes that the [[evolution]] of bipedalism was linked to monogamy. In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early [[hominids]] engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort aimed at the rearing of offspring. Lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the survivorship of the offspring and increase the pair's reproductive rate. Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs. This model is supported by the reduction (&quot;feminization&quot;) of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunet|first=Michel|coauthors=Guy F, Pilbeam D, Mackaye HT, Likius A et al.|title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa|journal=Nature|date=11|year=2002|month=July|volume=418|pages=145–151|doi=10.1038/nature00879|pmid=12110880|url=http://www.nature.com/nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suwa|first=Gen|coauthors=Kono RT, Simpson SW, Asfaw B, Lovejoy CO, White TD|title=Paleobiological implications of the Ardipithecus ramidus dentition.|journal=Science|date=2|year=2009|month=October|volume=326|pages=94–99|doi=10.1126/science.1175824|pmid=19810195|url=http://www.sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which along with low body size dimorphism in ''Ardipithecus''&lt;ref&gt;White TD et al. Science. 2009 326(5949):75-86&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Australopithecus'',&lt;ref&gt;Reno PL et al. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 365(1556):3355-63; Harmon E. J Hum Evol. 2009 56(6):551-9.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Lovejoy CO.  Science. 2009 326(5949):74e1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of sexual swelling) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; 

However, this model has generated some controversy, as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous. Among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size. That is [[sexual dimorphism]] is minimal, and other studies have suggested that [[Australopithecus afarensis]] males were nearly twice the weight of females (as well as a great deal taller){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy CO. Science. 1981 211(4480):341-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom &lt;ref&gt;Keith Oatley, Dacher Keltner, Jennifer M. Jenkins. Understanding Emotion (2006) Second Edition. Page 235.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as [[gibbons]] tend to be also territorial, but fossil evidence indicates that ''Australopithecus afarensis'' lived in large groups. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a group living primate.

====Other behavioural models====
There are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski &amp; Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others (''e.g.'' Dart 1925) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins (''e.g.'' 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested (''e.g.'' Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive.

====Thermoregulatory model====
The thermoregulatory model explaining the origin of bipedalism is one of the simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of [[Ardipithecus]] reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the [[forest]] and [[woodland]] environmental [[preadaptation]] of early-stage [[hominid]] bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of [[natural selection]]. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions [[ecological niche]], rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus.

====Carrying models====
Charles Darwin wrote that &quot;Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will&quot; Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought. Gordon Hewes (1961) suggested that the carrying of meat &quot;over considerable distances&quot; (Hewes 1961:689) was the key factor. Isaac (1978) and Sinclair et al. (1986) offered modifications of this idea as indeed did Lovejoy (1981) with his 'provisioning model' described above. Others, such as Nancy Tanner (1981) have suggested that infant carrying was key, whilst others have suggested stone tools and weapons drove the change.{{Who|date=October 2010}}

====Wading models====
Several theories have been proposed regarding the influence of water on human bipedalism.  The [[aquatic ape hypothesis]], promoted for several decades by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]], proposed that swimming, diving and aquatic food sources exerted a strong influence on many aspects of human evolution, including bipedalism.&lt;ref name = Morgan1997&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Elaine | authorlink = Elaine Morgan (writer) | title = The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis   | year = 1997 | month =  | publisher = Souvenir Press | isbn = 0285635182  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not accepted by or considered a serious theory within anthropological scholarly community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=0Zim5e65ij4C&amp;pg=PA64 64] | title = Psychology &amp; evolution: the origins of mind | isbn = 0761924795 | last = Bridgeman | first = B | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Meier&gt;{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0028644212 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?doi=r_Wit4KYSmMC&amp;pg=PA57 57–59]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly theories have been proposed that suggest wading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | 10.1007/s00114-009-0637-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the exploitation of aquatic food sources (providing essential nutrients for human brain evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunnane | first = Stephen C | title = Survival of the fattest: the key to human brain evolution | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company | year = 2005 | isbn = 9812561919 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=kKNpHN3dDaUC&amp;pg=PA259 259]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or critical fallback foods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wrangham R, Cheney D, Seyfarth R, Sarmiento E |title=Shallow-water habitats as sources of fallback foods for hominins |journal=Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. |volume=140 |issue=4 |pages=630–42 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19890871 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21122 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) may have exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors leading to bipedalism.

==Physiology==
Bipedal movement occurs in a number of ways, and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations. Some of these are described below.

===Biomechanics===
====Standing====
Energy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid [[feedback|overcorrection]].  The difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly, even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness.

====Walking====
Walking is characterized by an &quot;inverted pendulum&quot; movement in which the body vaults over a stiff leg with each step.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=1sz5501URh0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=macmahon+muscles&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ooh2TO_ZCcH58Aa_7cy1Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Force plate]]s can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic &amp; potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;  Interestingly, this model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion is does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, walking is composed of several separate processes&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;:
* Vaulting over a stiff stance leg
* Passive ballistic movement of the swing leg
* A short 'push' from the ankle prior to toe-off, propelling the swing leg
* Rotation of the hips about the axis of the spine, to increase stride length
* rotation of the hips about the horizontal axis to improve balance during stance

====Running====
Running is characterized by a spring-mass movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;  Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored &amp; released from a spring-like limb during foot contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;  Again, the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Musculature===
Bipedalism requires strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs. Contrast in [[domestication|domesticated]] [[poultry]] the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings. Likewise in humans, the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]] muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is much larger than even the well-developed biceps of the arms.

===Nervous system===
The famous knee jerk (or [[patellar reflex]]) emphasizes the necessary bipedal control system: the only function served by the nerves involved being connected as they are is to ensure quick response to imminent disturbance of erect posture; it not only occurs without conscious mental activity, but also involves none of the nerves which lead from the leg to the brain.

A less well-known aspect of bipedal [[neuroanatomy]] can be demonstrated in human infants who have not yet developed toward the ability to stand up. They can nevertheless run with great dexterity, provided they are supported in a vertical position and offered the stimulus of a moving treadmill beneath their feet.

===Respiration===
A biped also has the ability to breathe whilst it runs. Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] system is functioning. During a sprint, at which point the anaerobic system kicks in, breathing slows until the [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] system can no longer sustain a sprint.

This is not necessarily an advantage over quadrupeds, as not only can many quadrupeds breathe while running, but in mammals such as dogs, the act of running helps to expand and contract the lungs. The muscles of the trunk thus perform locomotive and respiratory tasks at the same time, making breathing while running more efficient in these animals than in bipeds{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

==Bipedal robots==
{{Main|humanoid robot}}
[[Image:Asimo.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[ASIMO]] - a bipedal robot]]
For nearly the whole of the 20th century, bipedal [[robot]]s were very difficult to construct and [[robot locomotion]] involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible. Some notable biped robots are [[ASIMO]], [[HUBO]] and [[QRIO]].  Recently, spurred by the success of creating a fully passive, un-powered bipedal walking robot,&lt;ref&gt;http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/hplab/pdw.html&lt;/ref&gt; those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion, which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bootstrapping''' or '''booting''' refers to a group of metaphors that share a common meaning: a self-sustaining process that proceeds without external help.

The term is often attributed to [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]]'s story ''[[wikisource:The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen|The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', where the main character pulls himself out of a [[swamp]] by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), but the Baron does not, in fact, pull himself out by his [[:wikt:bootstrap|bootstraps]]. Instead, the phrase appears to have originated in the early 19th century United States (particularly in the sense &quot;pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps&quot;), from a similar tall tale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-boo2.htm World Wide Words: Boot], Michael Quinion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;linguist-listserv&quot;&gt;{{cite mailing list | url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0508D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=14748 | title=bootstraps--speculation/questions | date=2005-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dr Martens, black, old.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pair of boots with one bootstrap visible.]]
Tall [[boot]]s may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a tool to provide greater force in pulling the boots on. The saying &quot;to pull yourself up by your bootstraps&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0508b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=14972 Bootstrap citations from 1800s]&lt;/ref&gt; was already in use during the 19th century as an example of an impossible task.  Bootstrap as a metaphor, meaning to better oneself by one's own unaided efforts, was in use in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']] cited in the Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphor spawned additional metaphors for a series of self-sustaining processes that proceed without external help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/290800.html Phrase Finder]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Computing===
{{main | Booting}}

The computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a hardwired program to read a bootstrap program from an input unit and then execute the bootstrap program which caused reading of more program instructions and became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions.  As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=[[Oxford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bootstrap concept was used in the [[IBM 701]] computer (1952–1956) which had a &quot;load button&quot; which initiated reading of the first 36-bit word from a punched card in a card reader, from a magnetic tape unit or a drum unit (predecessor of the [[hard disk drive]]).  The left 18-bit half-word was then executed as an instruction which read additional words into memory.&lt;ref&gt;''From Gutenberg to the Internet'', Jeremy M. Norman, 2005, page 436, ISBN 0-930405-87-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also championed by [[Doug Engelbart]], to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His SRI team that developed the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they'd developed to improve the tool. The development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion.

===Business===
[[Bootstrapping (business)|Bootstrapping in business]] is to start a business without external help/capital.  Startups that bootstrap their business fund development of their company through internal cash flow and are cautious with their expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturebeat.com/2008/11/20/the-art-of-the-bootstrap/ The Art of the Bootstrap, Venture Beat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sparxoo.com/?p=253 Startup Survival Guide, Sparxoo]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally at the start of a venture a small amount of money will be set aside for the bootstrap&lt;ref name=&quot;Bootstrap&quot;&gt;[http://www.bootstrapbusiness.org/ Bootstrap]&lt;/ref&gt; process.

* See [[Operation Bootstrap]] (&quot;Operación Manos a la Obra&quot;), ambitious projects which industrialized Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century.

===Biology===
[[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''River Out of Eden''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''River Out of Eden'', pages 23-25, 1995 (paper) ISBN 0-465-06990-8&lt;/ref&gt; used the computer bootstrapping concept to explain how biological cells differentiate: &quot;Different cells receive different combinations of chemicals, which switch on different combinations of genes, and some genes work to switch other genes on or off.  And so the bootstrapping continues, until we have the full repertoire of different kinds of cells.&quot;

===Phylogenetics===
Bootstrapping analysis gives a way to judge the strength of support for nodes on [[phylogenetic tree]]s. A number is presented by each node, which reflects the percentage of bootstrap trees which also resolve that [[clade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Baltic languages''' are a group of related [[language]]s belonging to the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family and spoken mainly in areas extending east and southeast of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Northern Europe]]. The language group is usually divided into two sub-groups: '''Western Baltic''', containing only extinct languages, and '''Eastern Baltic''', containing both extinct and the two living languages in the group: [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (including both Standard Lithuanian and [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian]]) and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (including both literary Latvian and [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]). The range of Eastern Balts reached to the Ural mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Marija Gimbutas 1963. The Balts. London : Thames and Hudson, Ancient peoples and places 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. P.

== Geographic distribution ==
[[Image:Baltic languages.png|thumb|left|Distribution of the Baltic languages in the Baltic (simplified).]]
Speakers of modern Baltic languages &lt;ref&gt;Though included among the [[Baltic states]], the language of [[Estonia]] (the [[Estonian language]]) is a [[Uralic language]] and is not related to the Baltic languages, which are [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].&lt;/ref&gt; are generally concentrated within the borders of [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], and in emigrant communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and states of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Historically the languages were spoken over a larger area: West to the mouth of the [[Vistula]] river in present-day [[Poland]], at least as far East as the [[Dniepr]] river in present-day [[Belarus]], perhaps even to [[Moscow]], perhaps as far south as [[Kiev]]. Key evidence of Baltic language presence in these regions is found in [[hydronym]]s (names of bodies of water) in the regions that are characteristically Baltic. Use of hydronyms is generally accepted to determine the extent of these cultures' influence, but ''not'' the date of such influence. Historical expansion of the usage of [[Slavic languages]] in the South and East, and [[Germanic languages]] in the West reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area which they had formerly covered.

== Prehistory and history ==
{{Indo-European topics}}
Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by ancient historians as early as 98 B.C., the first attestation of a Baltic language was in about 1350, with the creation of the ''Elbing Prussian Vocabulary'', a German to Prussian translation dictionary. It is also believed that Baltic languages are among the most archaic of the remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late attestation. Lithuanian was first attested in a hymnal translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a [[Catechism]] by [[Martynas Mažvydas]] was published in 1547 in [[Königsberg]], Prussia (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585. One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples [[Northern Crusades|resisted Christianization]] longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.

With the establishment of a [[Germany|German]] state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.

During the years of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569–1795), official documents were written in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Old Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Latin]], with Lithuanian being mostly an oral language, with small quantities of written documents.

After the [[Partitions of Poland]], most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]], where the native languages were sometimes prohibited from being written down, or used publicly.

== Relationship with other Indo-European languages ==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2009}}
The Baltic languages are of particular interest to linguists because they retain many archaic features, which are believed to have been present in the early stages of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]].

Linguists disagree regarding the relationship of the Baltic languages to other languages in the Indo-European family. Such relationships are discerned primarily by the [[comparative method]], which seeks to reconstruct the [[chronology]] of the languages' divergence from each other in [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. Language kinship is generally determined by the identification of linguistic innovations that are held in common by two languages or groups.

Several of the extinct Baltic languages have a limited or nonexistent written record, their existence being known only from the records of ancient historians and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.

The Baltic languages show the closest relationship with the Slavic languages, and are commonly reconstructed to have passed through a common [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]] stage, during which numerous Common Balto-Slavic lexical, phonological, morphological and accentological isoglosses developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Oswald Szemerényi|Szemerényi, Oswald]] | title=The problem of Balto-Slav unity | journal=Kratylos | year=1957 | volume=2 | pages=97–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beekes, Robert S. P. | title=Comparative Indo-European Linguistics | location=[[Amsterdam]] | publisher=John Benjamins | year=1995 | isbn=90-272-2151-0 (Europe), ISBN 1-55619-505-2 (U.S.) |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Russell D., and Clayton Atkinson. 2003. &quot;Language-tree divergence times support Anatolian theory of Indo-European Origins,&quot; ''Nature'' 426 (27 November): 435-439.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative Balto-Slavic [[accentology]] is one of the most active branches of [[Indo-European studies]] nowadays, with numerous mysteries still waiting to be solved. Even the commonly accepted facts – such as [[Winter's law]], identical reflexes of Proto-Indo-European syllabic sonorants or development of Balto-Slavic [[mobile paradigm]]s – have many intricate problems in their formulations.

Some linguists feel that the Baltic languages do not represent a genetic node in either the Indo-European family or the Balto-Slavic group.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There are virtually no non-trivial isoglosses that connect the Baltic languages to Proto-Indo-European and leave the Slavic languages aside; West and East Baltic languages seem to differ from each other as much as each of them differs from [[Proto-Slavic]], and all major isoglosses that differentiate Slavic from Baltic that are usually mentioned are either Proto-Indo-European archaisms preserved in Baltic or later innovations in Slavic that occurred during the Common Slavic period, and not some &quot;Common Baltic&quot; innovations. Thus, there was most likely no &quot;Proto-Baltic&quot; stage, and the Baltic languages would thus represent an archaic remnant of the former Balto-Slavic dialect continuum, the last Proto-Indo-European branch to finally split, some theorize around 1500-1000 BCE. The [[Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture]] remains, hydronyms such as the [[Oka river]], and Baltic loanwords in [[Uralic]] add relevant dating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen V. 1890 Berøringer mellem de finske og de baltiske ( litauisk-lettiske ) Sprog. 4to. pp. 72-104.

Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such Baltic loanwords into [[Uralic]] are: East Baltic Lithuanian ''žalgas'' &quot;pole&quot; &gt; North [[Saami]] ''čuolggu'' &quot;lever&quot;, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''salko'' &quot;pole&quot;, or Lithuanian ''šaras'' &quot;fodder&quot; &gt; Mordvinian ''śora'' &quot;grain&quot;.

[[Image:Genome viewer screenshot small.png|thumbnail|right|220px|'''Map of the human X chromosome''' (from the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] website). Assembly of the [[human genome]] is one of the greatest achievements of bioinformatics.]]

'''Bioinformatics''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|en-us-bioinformatics.ogg|ˌ|b|aɪ|oʊ|ˌ|ɪ|n|f|ɚ|ˈ|m|æ|t|ɪ|k|s}}) is the application of [[statistics]] and [[computer science]] to the field of [[molecular biology]].

The term ''bioinformatics'' was coined by [[Paulien Hogeweg]] and Ben Hesper in 1978 for the study of informatic processes in biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1177/003754977803100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|21483479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary use since at least the late 1980s has been in genomics and genetics, particularly in those areas of genomics involving large-scale [[DNA sequencing]].

Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.

Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. It is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.

Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing [[DNA]] and protein sequences, aligning different DNA and protein sequences to compare them and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.

The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques (e.g., [[pattern recognition]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] algorithms, and [[Biological Data Visualization|visualization]]) to achieve this goal. Major research efforts in the field include [[sequence alignment]], [[gene finding]], [[genome assembly]], [[drug design]], [[drug discovery]], [[protein structural alignment|protein structure alignment]], [[protein structure prediction]], prediction of [[gene expression]] and [[protein–protein interactions]], [[genome-wide association studies]] and the modeling of [[evolution]].

Bioinformatics was applied in the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological information at the beginning of the &quot;genomic revolution&quot;, such as nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Development of this type of database involved not only design issues but the development of complex interfaces whereby researchers could both access existing data as well as submit new or revised data.

In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data, including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures. The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:
* the development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access to, and use and management of, various types of information.
* the development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets, such as methods to locate a gene within a sequence, predict protein structure and/or function, and cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences.

There are two fundamental ways of modelling a Biological system (e.g. living cell) both coming under Bioinformatic approaches.
*Static
**Sequences – Proteins, Nucleic acids and Peptides
**Structures – Proteins, Nucleic acids, Ligands (including metabolites and drugs) and Peptides
**Interaction data among the above entities including microarray data and Networks of proteins, metabolites
*Dynamic
**Systems Biology comes under this category including reaction fluxes and variable concentrations of metabolites
**Multi-Agent Based modelling approaches capturing cellular events such as signalling, transcription and reaction dynamics

A broad sub-category under bioinformatics is [[structural bioinformatics]].

==Major research areas==
===Sequence analysis===
{{main|Sequence alignment|Sequence database}}

Since the [[Phi X 174|Phage Φ-X174]] was [[sequencing|sequenced]] in 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid870828&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanger F, Air GM, Barrell BG, Brown NL, Coulson AR, Fiddes CA, Hutchison CA, Slocombe PM, Smith M |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA |journal=Nature |volume=265 |issue=5596 |pages=687–95 |year=1977 |month=February |pmid=870828 |doi= 10.1038/265687a0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[DNA sequence]]s of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode [[polypeptides]] ([[proteins]]), RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a [[species]] or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of [[molecular systematics]] to construct [[phylogenetic tree]]s). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today, [[computer program]]s such as [[BLAST]] are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion [[nucleotides]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18073190&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benson DA, Karsch-Mizrachi I, Lipman DJ, Ostell J, Wheeler DL |title=GenBank |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=Database issue |pages=D25–30 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18073190 |pmc=2238942 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm929 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, in order to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this [[sequence alignment]] is used in the sequencing process itself. The so-called [[shotgun sequencing]] technique (which was used, for example, by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] to sequence the first bacterial genome, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7542800&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7542800 |doi= 10.1126/science.7542800|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) does not produce entire chromosomes, but instead generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the [[human genome]], it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly will usually contain numerous gaps that have to be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.

Another aspect of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is annotation, which involves computational [[gene finding]] to search for protein-coding genes, RNA genes, and other functional sequences within a genome. Not all of the nucleotides within a genome are part of genes. Within the genome of higher organisms, large parts of the DNA do not serve any obvious purpose. This so-called [[junk DNA]] may, however, contain unrecognized functional elements. Bioinformatics helps to bridge the gap between genome and [[proteome]] projects — for example, in the use of DNA sequences for protein identification.

===Genome annotation===
{{main|Gene finding}}

In the context of [[genomics]], [[Genome project#Genome annotation|annotation]] is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. The first genome annotation software system was designed in 1995 by Dr. Owen White, who was part of the team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free-living organism to be decoded, the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. Dr. White built a software system to find the genes (places in the DNA sequence that encode a protein), the transfer RNA, and other features, and to make initial assignments of function to those genes. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA are constantly changing and improving.

===Computational evolutionary biology===
[[Evolutionary biology]] is the study of the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time. [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] has assisted evolutionary biologists in several key ways; it has enabled researchers to:
* trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their [[DNA]], rather than through [[physical taxonomy]] or physiological observations alone,
* more recently, compare entire [[genomes]], which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as [[gene duplication]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], and the prediction of factors important in bacterial [[speciation]],
* build complex computational models of populations to predict the outcome of the system over time
* track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms
Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex [[Evolutionary tree|tree of life]].

The area of research within [[computer science]] that uses [[genetic algorithm]]s is sometimes confused with [[computational evolutionary biology]], but the two areas are not necessarily related.

===Literature analysis===
{{main|Text mining}}

The growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed subfields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:
* abbreviation recognition - identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms,
* named entity recognition - recognizing biological terms such as gene names
* protein-protein interaction - identify which proteins interact with which proteins from text

The area of research uses [[statistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], and is substantially influenced by them.

===Analysis of gene expression===
The [[gene expression|expression]] of many genes can be determined by measuring [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] levels with multiple techniques including [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[expressed sequence tag|expressed cDNA sequence tag]] (EST) sequencing, [[serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) tag sequencing, [[massively parallel signature sequencing]] (MPSS), [[RNA-Seq]], also known as &quot;Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing&quot; (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate [[signal (information theory)|signal]] from [[noise]] in high-throughput gene expression studies. Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous [[epithelial]] cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.

===Analysis of regulation===
Regulation is the complex orchestration of events starting with an extracellular signal such as a [[hormone]] and leading to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more [[protein]]s. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process. For example, [[promoter analysis]] involves the identification and study of [[sequence motif]]s in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare [[microarray]] data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the [[cell cycle]], along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply [[cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]] to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented [[regulatory elements]].

===Analysis of protein expression===
[[Protein microarray]]s and high throughput (HT) [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected.

===Analysis of mutations in cancer===
In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown [[point mutation]]s in a variety of [[gene]]s in [[cancer]]. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of [[human genome]] sequences and [[germline]] polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as [[oligonucleotide]] microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called [[comparative genomic hybridization]]), and [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] arrays to detect known ''point mutations''. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate [[terabyte]]s of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or [[noise]], and thus [[Hidden Markov model]] and [[change-point analysis]] methods are being developed to infer real [[copy number variation|copy number]] changes.

Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of [[lesion]]s found to be recurrent among many tumors &lt;!-- this is specific enough, compared to general knowledge in previous paragraph, that it would be nice to have a source or example --&gt;
.

===Comparative genomics===
{{main|Comparative genomics}}

The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between [[genes]] ([[orthology]] analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and [[endosymbiosis]], often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, [[heuristics]], fixed parameter and [[approximation algorithms]] for problems based on parsimony models to [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms for [[Bayesian analysis]] of problems based on probabilistic models.

Many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein families computation.

===Modeling biological systems===
{{main|Computational systems biology}}

Systems biology involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. [[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

===High-throughput image analysis===
Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content [[biomedical imagery]]. Modern image analysis systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving [[accuracy]], [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both [[diagnostics]] and research. Some examples are:
* high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization ([[high-content screening]], cytohistopathology, [[Bioimage informatics]])
* [[morphometrics]]
* clinical image analysis and visualization
* determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals
* quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury
* making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals
* infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination
* inferring clone overlaps in [[Gene mapping|DNA mapping]], e.g. the [[Sulston score]]

===Structural Bioinformatic Approaches===
====Prediction of protein structure====
{{main|Protein structure prediction}}

Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, the so-called [[primary structure]], can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] – aka [[Mad Cow Disease]] – [[prion]].) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. For lack of better terms, structural information is usually classified as one of ''[[secondary structure|secondary]]'', ''[[tertiary structure|tertiary]]'' and ''[[quaternary structure|quaternary]]'' structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. As of now, most efforts have been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.

One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene ''A'', whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene ''B,'' whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called homology modeling, this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.

One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes ([[leghemoglobin]]). Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes.

Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and ''de novo'' (from scratch) physics-based modeling.

''See also:'' [[structural motif]] and [[structural domain]].

====Molecular Interaction====
Efficient software is available today for studying interactions among proteins, ligands and peptides. Types of interactions most often encountered in the field include – Protein–ligand (including drug), protein–protein and protein–peptide.

Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms, termed '''docking algorithms''' for studying molecular interactions.

''See also:'' [[protein–protein interaction prediction]].

=====Docking algorithms=====
{{main|Protein–protein docking}}
In the last two decades, tens of thousands of protein three-dimensional structures have been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (protein NMR). One central question for the biological scientist is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without doing [[protein–protein interaction]] experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the [[Protein–protein docking]] problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.

==Software and tools==
[[Software]] tools for bioinformatics range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various [[List of bioinformatics companies|bioinformatics companies]] or public institutions.

===Open source bioinformatics software===
Many [[free and open source software]] tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=obf-main&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: About us|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page|work=Official website|publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of a continued need for new [[algorithm]]s for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative ''[[in silico]]'' experiments, and freely available [[open code]] bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] in commercial applications. They may also provide ''[[de facto]]'' standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.  

The [[List of open source software packages|range of open source software packages]] includes titles such as [[Bioconductor]], [[BioPerl]], [[BioJava]], [[Bioclipse]], [[EMBOSS]], [[Taverna workbench]], and [[UGENE]]. In order to maintain this tradition and create further opportunities, the non-profit [[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]&lt;ref name=obf-main /&gt; have supported the annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) since 2000.&lt;ref name=obf-bosc&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: BOSC|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC|work=Official website|publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web services in bioinformatics===
[[SOAP]] and [[REST]]-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.

Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] into three categories: [[Sequence alignment software|SSS]] (Sequence Search Services), [[Multiple sequence alignment|MSA]] (Multiple Sequence Alignment) and [[Bioinformatics#Sequence analysis|BSA]] (Biological Sequence Analysis). The availability of these [[Service-orientation|service-oriented]] bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible [[bioinformatics workflow management systems]].

'''Brian Russell De Palma''' (born September 11, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[film director]] and [[writer]]. In a career spanning over 40 years, he is probably best known for his [[suspense]] and crime [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] films, including such [[box office]] successes as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]''.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, De Palma worked repeatedly with actors [[Jennifer Salt]], [[Amy Irving]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] (his wife from 1979 to 1983), [[Gary Sinise]], [[John Lithgow]], [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Gerrit Graham]], cinematographers [[Stephen H. Burum]] and [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] (see [[List of noted film director and cinematographer collaborations]]), set designer [[Jack Fisk]], and composers [[Bernard Herrmann]] and [[Pino Donaggio]]. De Palma is credited with fostering the careers of or outright discovering [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Andy Garcia]] and [[Margot Kidder]].

==Early life==
De Palma, whose background is [[Italian American|Italian]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the son of Vivienne (née Muti) and [[Anthony DePalma|Anthony Frederick De Palma]], an [[orthopedic]] surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmreference.com/film/80/Brian-De-Palma.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New Hampshire]] in various [[Protestant]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] schools, eventually graduating from [[Friends' Central School]]. He won a regional science-fair prize for a project titled &quot;An [[Analog Computer]] to Solve Differential Equations&quot;.

==1960s and early career==
Enrolled at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] as a physics student, De Palma became enraptured with the filmmaking process after viewing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. De Palma subsequently enrolled at the newly coed [[Sarah Lawrence College]] as a graduate student in their theater department in the early 1960s, becoming one of the first male students among a female population. Once there, influences as various as drama teacher [[Wilford Leach]], the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles brothers]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] impressed upon De Palma the many styles and themes that would shape his own cinema in the coming decades. An early association with a young [[Robert De Niro]] resulted in ''[[The Wedding Party (film)|The Wedding Party]]''. The film, which was co-directed with Leach and producer Cynthia Munroe, had been shot in 1963 but remained unreleased until 1969, when De Palma's star had risen sufficiently within the [[Greenwich Village]] filmmaking scene. De Niro was unknown at the time; the credits mistakenly display his name as &quot;Robert Denero.&quot; The film is noteworthy for its invocation of silent film techniques and an insistence on the [[jump-cut]] for effect. De Palma followed this with various small films for the [[NAACP]] and The [[U.S. Treasury Department|Treasury Department]].

During the 1960s, De Palma began making a living producing documentary films, notably ''The Responsive Eye'', a 1966 movie about The Responsive Eye [[op-art]] exhibit curated by William Seitz for [[MOMA|Museum of Modern Art]] in 1965. In an interview with Gelmis from 1969, De Palma described the film as &quot;very good and very successful. It's distributed by Pathe Contemporary and makes lots of money. I shot it in four hours, with synched sound. I had two other guys shooting people's reactions to the paintings, and the paintings themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gelmis |first= Joseph |authorlink=  |title= The Film Director as Superstar |year= 1970 |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location= Garden City  | page =24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dionysus (film)|Dionysus in 69]]'' (1969) was De Palma's other major documentary from this period. The film records [[The Performance Group]]'s performance of Euripides’ [[The Bacchae]], starring, amongst others, De Palma regular William Finley. The play is noted for breaking traditional barriers between performers and audience. The film's most striking quality is its extensive use of the [[split screen (film)|split-screen]]. De Palma recalls that he was “floored” by this performance upon first sight, and in 1973 recounts how he &quot;began to try and figure out a way to capture it on film. I came up with the idea of split-screen, to be able to show the actual audience involvement, to trace the life of the audience and that of the play as they merge in and out of each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Knapp | first= Lawrence |title= Brian De Palma Interviews |year= 2003 |publisher= University Press of Mississippi | location= Jackson|page= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Palma's most significant features from this decade are ''[[Greetings (film)|Greetings]]'' (1968) and ''[[Hi, Mom!]]'' (1970). Both films star Robert De Niro and espouse a [[Leftist]] [[revolutionary]] viewpoint common to their era. ''Greetings'' was entered into the [[19th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it won a [[Silver Bear]] award.&lt;ref name=&quot;berlinale 1969&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1969/03_preistr_ger_1969/03_Preistraeger_1969.html |title=Berlinale 1969: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-03-06 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other major film from this period is the slasher comedy ''[[Murder a la Mod]]''. Each of these films contains experiments in narrative and [[intertextuality]], reflecting De Palma's stated intention to become the &quot;American Godard&quot; while integrating several of the themes which permeated Hitchcock's work. 

''Greetings'' is about three New Yorkers dealing with draft. The film is often considered the first to deal explicitly with the draft. The film is noteworthy for its use of various experimental techniques to convey its narrative in ultimately unconventional ways. Footage was sped up, rapid cutting used to distance the audience from the narrative, and it was difficult to discern with whom the audience must ultimately align. &quot;Greetings&quot; ultimately grossed over $1 million at the box office and cemented De Palma's position as a bankable filmmaker. 

After the success of his 1968 breakthrough, De Palma and his producing partner ([[Charles Hirsch]]) were given the opportunity by Sigma 3 to make an unofficial sequel of sorts, initially entitled ''Son of Greetings'', and subsequently released as ''Hi, Mom!''. While &quot;Greetings&quot; accentuated its varied cast, ''Hi, Mom!'' focuses on De Niro's character, Jon Rubin, an essential carry-over from the previous film. The film is ultimately significant insofar as it displays the first enunciation of De Palma's style in all its major traits – voyeurism, guilt, and a hyper-consciousness of the medium are all on full display, not just as hallmarks, but built into this formal, material apparatus itself. 

These traits come to the fore in ''Hi, Mom!'''s &quot;[[Be Black, Baby]]&quot; sequence. This sequence parodies [[cinéma vérité]], the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of [[Brecht]]ian distanciation: “First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In ''Hi, Mom!'' for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching at the same time that you are emotionally involved with it.” 

&quot;Be Black, Baby&quot; was filmed in black and white stock on 16&amp;nbsp;mm, in low-light conditions that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of “realism.” In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes “[Be Black, Baby] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action.” Furthermore, “I wanted to show in ''Hi, Mom!'' how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – “Be Black, Baby” – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck ‘em in and annihilate ‘em. Then you say, “It's just a movie, right? It's not real.” It's just like television. You’re sucked in all the time, and you’re being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The “Be Black, Baby” section of ''Hi, Mom!'' is probably the most important piece of film I’ve ever done.”

==Transition to Hollywood==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2007}}

In the 1970s, De Palma went to Hollywood where he did big budget films: after several small, studio and independent released films that included stand-outs ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'' and ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'', a small film based on a novel called ''Carrie'' was released directed by Brian De Palma. The [[psychic]] thriller ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by [[United Artists]], and well under the cultural radar during the early months of production, as [[Stephen King]]'s source novel had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the saleability of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though the stars [[Sissy Spacek]] and [[John Travolta]] had gained considerable attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic [[situation comedy|sitcoms]]. ''Carrie'' became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and [[Piper Laurie]] Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice-versa. The &quot;shock ending&quot; finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of [[split screen (film)|split-screen]], split-diopter and [[slow motion]] shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.

The financial and critical success of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' was a novel that had fascinated De Palma since the late 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and [[avant-garde]] storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, and has yet to appear onscreen (Steven Spielberg's adaptation of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of ''The Demolished Man'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The result of his experience with adapting ''The Demolished Man'' was ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'', a [[science fiction|sci-fi]] psychic thriller that starred [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Carrie Snodgress]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Amy Irving]]. The film was admired by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], who featured a clip in his mammoth [[Histoire(s) du cinéma]], and [[Pauline Kael]] who championed both ''The Fury'' and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', the thematic complex thrillers for which he is now better known.

For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, most notably ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Carlito's Way]]'', pushed the envelope of violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary from one another in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of ''Scarface'' contrast with the more emotional tragedy of ''Carlito's Way''. Both films feature Al Pacino in what has become a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;.

Later into the 1990s and 2000s, De Palma did other films. He attempted to do dramas and a few thrillers plus science fiction. Some of these movies (''Mission: Impossible, Carlito's Way'') worked and some others (''Mission to Mars, Raising Cain, Snake Eyes, The Bonfire of the Vanities'') failed at the box office. Of these films, ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' would be De Palma's biggest box office disaster, losing millions. Another later movie from De Palma, ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'', unleashed a torrent of controversy over its subject of American involvement in [[Iraq]], and atrocities committed there. It received limited release in the United States.

De Palma today resides in Los Angeles.

==Trademarks and style==
===Themes===
De Palma's films can fall into two categories, his [[psychological thriller]]s (''Sisters'', ''Obsession'', ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Blow Out'', ''Raising Cain'') and his other commercial films (''Scarface'', ''The Untouchables'', ''Carlito's Way'', and ''Mission: Impossible''). He has often produced &quot;De Palma&quot; films one after the other before going on to direct a different genre, but would always return to his familiar territory. Because of the subject matter and [[graphic violence]] of some of De Palma's films, such as ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Scarface'' and ''Body Double'', they are often at the center of controversy with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], [[Film criticism|film critics]] and the viewing public. 

De Palma is known for quoting and referencing other director's work throughout his career. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Conversation]]'' plots were used for the basis of ''Blow Out''. ''The Untouchables''' finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the [[Odessa]] Steps sequence in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''. The main plot from ''[[Rear Window]]'' was used for ''Body Double'', while it also used elements of ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. ''Vertigo'' was also the basis for ''Obsession''. ''Dressed to Kill'' was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (film)|Psycho]]'', including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.

===Camera shots===
Film critics have often noted De Palma's trend for camera tricks, good and bad, throughout his career. He often frames characters against the background using a [[Dutch angle|canted angle shot]]. [[split screen (film)|Split-screen]] techniques have been used to show two separate events happening simultaneously. To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a [[Circle|360-degree]] camera [[Panning (camera)|pan]]. Slow sweeping, panning and [[tracking shot]]s are often used throughout his films. Split focus shots are used to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus.

==Significant collaborations==
De Palma has collaborated with many of the same actors and crew members throughout his career. [[Robert De Niro]] starred in ''The Wedding Party'', ''Greetings'', ''Hi, Mom!'', and ''The Untouchables''. [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] had acting roles in ''Carrie'', ''Home Movies'', ''Dressed to Kill'' and ''Blow Out''. Other actors that De Palma has worked with on more than one occasion include [[Jennifer Salt]] (''The Wedding Party'', ''Hi, Mom!'', and ''Sisters''), [[Charles Durning]] (''Hi, Mom!'', ''Sisters'', and ''The Fury''), [[Al Pacino]] (''Scarface'' and ''Carlito's Way''), [[John Lithgow]] (''Obsession'', ''Blow Out'' and ''Raising Cain''), [[Sean Penn]] (''Casualties of War'' and ''Carlito's Way''), [[Amy Irving]] (''Carrie'', ''The Fury'' and ''Casualties of War'' (uncredited voice-over)), and [[John Travolta]] (''Carrie'', ''Blow Out'').

De Palma has consistently worked with a group of [[screenwriter]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[Film editing|editor]]s and [[composer]]s throughout his career. Screenwriter [[David Koepp]] worked with him on ''Carlito's Way'', ''Mission: Impossible'', and ''Snake Eyes''. He commonly works with cinematographers [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] (''Obsession'', ''Blow Out'', ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', ''The Black Dahlia'') and [[Stephen H. Burum]] (''Body Double'', ''The Untouchables'', ''Casualties of War'', ''Raising Cain'', ''Carlito's Way'', ''Snake Eyes'', ''Mission to Mars''). De Palma has also worked with composers [[Pino Donaggio]] (''Carrie'', ''Home Movies'', ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Blow Out'', ''Body Double'', ''Raising Cain'') and [[Ennio Morricone]] (''The Untouchables'', ''Casualties of War'', ''Mission to Mars'' and ''Capone Rising''). Furthermore, De Palma has used editors [[Bill Pankow]] (''Body Double'', ''The Untouchables'', ''Casualties of War'', ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', ''Carlito's Way'', ''Snake Eyes'', ''The Black Dahlia'', ''Redacted'') and [[Paul Hirsch (film editor)|Paul Hirsch]] (''Phantom of the Paradise'', ''Carrie'', ''Raising Cain'', ''Mission to Mars'').

==Personal life==
De Palma has been married and divorced three times. He married Nancy Allen in 1979 and divorced her in 1983. He married producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] in 1991, who had previously been married to Director [[James Cameron]]. They had one child together and divorced in 1993. De Palma's last wife was Darnell Gregorio, who he married in 1993. They divorced four years later, and had a child together.

==Legacy==
[[File:BrianDePalma09TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|De Palma at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the [[New Hollywood]] generation of film directors, a distinct pedigree who either emerged from film schools or are overtly cine-literate. His contemporaries include [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Paul Schrader]], [[John Milius]], [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Ridley Scott]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]. His artistry in directing and use of cinematography and suspense in several of his films has often been compared to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-depalma24sep24,0,6512079.story|title=The Director's Craft: The death-deifying De Palma|accessdate=2007-12-26|first=Peter|last=Rainier|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080325222433/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-depalma24sep24,0,6512079.story |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Palma has encouraged and fostered the filmmaking careers of directors such as [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Mark Romanek]] and [[Keith Gordon]]. Tarantino said - during interview with De Palma, that ''Blow Out'' is one of his all time favourite films, and that after watching ''Scarface'' he knew how to make his own film. [[Terrence Malick]] credits seeing De Palma's early films on college campus tours as a validation of [[independent film]], and subsequently switched his attention from [[philosophy]] to filmmaking.

In his review of ''[[Femme Fatale (film)|Femme Fatale]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote about the director: &quot;De Palma deserves more honor as a director. Consider also these titles: ''Sisters, Blow Out, The Fury, Dressed to Kill, Carrie, Scarface, Wise Guys, Casualties of War, Carlito's Way, Mission: Impossible.'' Yes, there are a few failures along the way (''Snake Eyes, Mission to Mars, The Bonfire of the Vanities''), but look at the range here, and reflect that these movies contain treasure for those who admire the craft as well as the story, who sense the glee with which De Palma manipulates images and characters for the simple joy of being good at it. It's not just that he sometimes works in the style of Hitchcock, but that he has the nerve to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20021106%2FREVIEWS%2F211060301%2F1023&amp;AID1=%2F20021106%2FREVIEWS%2F211060301%2F1023&amp;AID2= Roger Ebert's review of ''Femme Fatale'' (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North American B-25 Mitchell''' was an American twin-engined [[medium bomber]] manufactured by [[North American Aviation]]. It was used by many [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces, in every theater of World War II, as well as many other air forces after the war ended, and saw service across four decades.

The B-25 was named in honor of General [[Billy Mitchell]], a pioneer of U.S. military aviation. The B-25 is the only American military aircraft named after a specific person. By the end of its production, nearly 10,000 B-25s in numerous models had been built. These included a few limited variations, such as the [[United States Navy]]'s and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps']] PBJ-1 patrol bomber and the [[United States Army Air Forces]]' F-10 [[reconnaissance|photo reconnaissance]] aircraft.

==Design and development==
[[Image:B25-1 300.jpg|right|thumb|Flight Performance School also included work in evaluating the performance of this B-25 Mitchell medium bomber]]

The B-25 was a descendant of the earlier [[North American XB-21|XB-21]] (North American-39) project of the mid-[[List of years in aviation#1930s in aviation|1930s]]. Experience gained in developing that aircraft was eventually used by North American in designing the B-25 (called the NA-40 by the company). One NA-40 was built, with several modifications later being done to test a number of potential improvements. These improvements included [[Wright R-2600]] [[radial engine]]s, which would become standard on the later B-25.

In 1939, the modified and improved NA-40B was submitted to the [[United States Army Air Corps]] for evaluation. This aircraft was originally intended to be an attack bomber for export to the United Kingdom and France, both of which had a pressing requirement for such aircraft in the early stages of World War II. However, those countries changed their minds, opting instead for the also-new [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] DB-7 (later to be used by the US as the [[A-20 Havoc]]). Despite this loss of sales, the NA-40B re-entered the spotlight when the Army Air Corps evaluated it for use as a medium bomber. Unfortunately, the NA-40B was destroyed in a crash on 11 April 1939. Nonetheless, the type was ordered into production, along with the Army's other new medium bomber, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] [[B-26 Marauder]].

===Early production===
[[Image:B25-mitchell-assembly.jpg|thumb|right|Mitchell production in Kansas City in 1942]]

An improvement of the NA-40B, dubbed the '''NA-62''', was the basis for the first actual B-25. Due to the pressing need for medium bombers by the Army, no experimental or service-test versions were built. Any necessary modifications were made during production runs, or to existing aircraft at field modification centers around the world.

A significant change in the early days of B-25 production was a re-design of the wing. In the first nine aircraft, a constant-[[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] wing was used, in which the wing had a consistent, straight, slight upward angle from the fuselage to the wing tip. This design caused stability problems, and as a result, the dihedral angle was nullified on the outboard wing sections, giving the B-25 its slightly [[gull wing]] configuration. Less noticeable changes during this period included an increase in the size of the tail fins and a decrease in their inward cant.

A total of 6,608 B-25s were built at North American's [[Fairfax Airport]] plant in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].

A descendant of the B-25 was the [[North American XB-28]], meant to be a high-altitude version of the B-25. Despite this premise, the actual aircraft bore little resemblance to the Mitchell. It had much more in common with the [[B-26 Marauder]].

===Far East===
The majority of B-25s in American service were used in the Pacific. It fought on [[Papua New Guinea]], in [[Burma]] and in the [[island hopping campaign]] in the central Pacific. It was in the Pacific that the aircraft’s potential as a ground attack aircraft was discovered and developed. The jungle environment reduced the usefulness of standard level bombing, and made low level attack the best tactic. The ever-increasing amount of forward firing guns was a response to this, making the B-25 a formidable strafing aircraft. 

In Burma the B-25 was often used to attack Japanese communication links, especially bridges in central Burma. It was also used to help supply the besieged troops at [[Imphal]] in 1944. 

In the Pacific the B-25 proved itself to be a very capable anti-shipping weapon, sinking many of the ships being used to reinforce the Japanese position. Later in the Pacific war the distance between islands limited the usefulness of the B-25, although it was used against [[Guam]] and [[Tinian]]. It was also used against Japanese-occupied islands that had been bypassed by the main campaign, as happened in the [[Marshal Islands]].

===Middle East and Italy===
The first B-25s arrived in Egypt just in time to take part in the [[battle of El Alamein]]. From there the aircraft took part in the rest of the campaign in North Africa, the invasion of Sicily and the advance up Italy. In Italy the B-25 was used in the ground attack role, concentrating on attacks against road and rail links in Italy, Austria and the Balkans. The B-25 had a longer range than the [[A-20 Havoc]] and [[A-26 Invader]]s, allowing it to reach further into occupied Europe. The five bombardment groups that used the B-25 in the desert and Italy were the only US units to use the B-25 in Europe.

===Europe===
The [[U.S. Eighth Air Force]], based in Britain, concentrated on long range raids over Germany and occupied Europe. Although it did have a small number units equipped with twin-engined aircraft, the B-25 was not amongst them. However, the RAF received nearly nine hundred Mitchells, using them to replace [[Douglas Boston]]s, [[Lockheed Ventura]]s and [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers. The Mitchell entered active RAF service on 22 January 1943. At first it was used to bomb strategic targets in occupied Europe. After the [[D-Day]] invasion the RAF used its Mitchells to support the armies in Europe, moving several squadrons to forward airbases in France and Belgium.

The B-25 first gained fame as the bomber used in the 18 April 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]], in which 16 B-25Bs led by the legendary [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Jimmy Doolittle]], attacked mainland Japan four months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The mission gave a much-needed lift in spirits to the Americans, and alarmed the Japanese who had believed their home islands were inviolable by enemy troops. While the amount of actual damage done was relatively minor, it forced the Japanese to divert troops for the home defense for the remainder of the war. The raiders took off from the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} and successfully bombed Tokyo and four other Japanese cities without loss. However, 15 subsequently crash-landed ''en route'' to recovery fields in Eastern China. These losses were the result of the task force being spotted by Japanese fishing vessels forcing the bombers to take off {{convert|170|mi|km|abbr=on}} early, fuel exhaustion, stormy nighttime conditions with zero visibility, and lack of electronic homing aids at the recovery bases. Only one landed intact; it came down in the [[Soviet Union]], where its five-man crew was interned and the aircraft confiscated. Of the 80 aircrew, 69 survived their historic mission and eventually made it back to American lines.

Following a number of additional modifications, including the addition of [[Plexiglas]] windows for the navigator and radio operator, heavier nose armament, and [[deicing]] and anti-icing equipment, the '''B-25C''' was released to the Army. This was the second mass-produced version of the Mitchell, the first being the lightly armed B-25B used by the Doolittle Raiders. The B-25C and '''B-25D''' differed only in location of manufacture: -Cs at [[Inglewood, California]], -Ds at [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. A total of 3,915 B-25Cs and -Ds were built by North American during World War II.

Although the B-25 was originally designed to bomb from medium altitudes in level flight, it was used frequently in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific theater]] (SWPA) on treetop-level [[strafing]] and parafrag (parachute-retarded fragmentation bombs) missions against Japanese airfields in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Philippines]]. These heavily armed Mitchells, field-modified at [[Townsville, Australia]], by [[Major]] [[Paul I. &quot;Pappy&quot; Gunn]] and North American tech rep Jack Fox, were also used on strafing and skip-bombing missions against Japanese shipping trying to re-supply their land-based armies. Under the leadership of [[Lieutenant General]] [[George C. Kenney]], B-25s of the [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]]s devastated Japanese targets in the SWPA from 1942 to 1945, and played a significant role in pushing the Japanese back to their home islands. B-25s were also used with devastating effect in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Central Pacific]], [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|Alaska]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]], [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] and [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|China-Burma-India]] (CBI) theaters.

==== Use as a gunship ====
&lt;!-- Gunship links here --&gt;
Because of the urgent need for hard-hitting strafer aircraft, a version dubbed the '''B-25G''' was developed, in which the standard-length transparent nose and the bombardier were replaced by a shorter solid nose containing two fixed .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[machine gun]]s and a 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) M4 cannon, one of the largest weapons fitted to an aircraft, similar to the experimental British [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito Mk. XVIII]], and German [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88P]] heavy cannon carrying aircraft. The cannon was manually loaded and serviced by the navigator, who was able to perform these operations without leaving his crew station just behind the pilot. This was possible due to the shorter nose of the G-model and the length of the M4, which allowed the breech to extend into the navigator's compartment.

The B-25G's successor, the '''B-25H''', had even more firepower. The M4 gun was replaced by the lighter [[75 mm gun (US)#T13E1 .2F M5|T13E1]], designed specifically for the aircraft. The 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) gun fired at a muzzle velocity of 2,362&amp;nbsp;[[feet per second|ft/s]] (about 720&amp;nbsp;[[metre per second|m/s]]). Due to its low rate of fire (approximately four rounds could be fired in a single [[strafing]] run) and relative ineffectiveness against ground targets, as well as substantial recoil, the 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) gun was sometimes removed from both G and H models and replaced with two additional .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns as a field modification.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzey 1999, pp. 51, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The -H also mounted four fixed forward-firing .50&amp;nbsp; (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose, four more fixed ones in forward-firing cheek blisters, two more in the top turret, one each in a pair of new waist positions, and a final pair in a new tail gunner's position. Company promotional material bragged the B-25H could &quot;bring to bear 10 machine guns coming and four going, in addition to the 75&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, a brace of eight [[unguided rocket|rockets]] and 3,000&amp;nbsp;lb (1,360&amp;nbsp;kg) of bombs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 1989, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The B-25H also featured a redesigned cockpit area, with the top turret moved forward to the navigator's compartment (thus requiring the addition of the waist and tail gun positions), and a heavily modified cockpit designed to be operated by a single pilot, the co-pilot's station and controls deleted, and the seat cut down and used by the navigator/cannoneer, the radio operator being moved to the aft compartment, operating the waist guns.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzey 1999, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 1,400 B-25Gs and B-25Hs were built.

The final version of the Mitchell, the '''B-25J''', looked much like the earlier B, C and D, having reverted to the longer nose. The less-than-successful 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) cannon was deleted on the J model. Instead, 800 of this version were built with a solid nose containing eight .50&amp;nbsp; (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns, while other J-models featured the earlier &quot;greenhouse&quot; style nose containing the bombardier's position. Regardless of the nose style used, all J-models also included two .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns in a &quot;fuselage package&quot; located directly under the pilot's station, and two more such guns in an identical package just under the co-pilot's compartment. The solid-nose B-25J variant carried an impressive total of 18 .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns: eight in the nose, four in under-cockpit packages, two in an upper turret, two in the waist, and a pair in the tail. No other bomber of World War II carried as many guns. However, the first 555 B-25Js (the B-25J-1-NC production block) were delivered without the fuselage package guns, because it was discovered muzzle blast from these guns was causing severe stress in the [[fuselage]]; this was cured with heavier fuselage skin patches, while later production runs returned these guns, they were often removed as a field modification for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzey 1999, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 4,318 B-25Js were built.

==== Flight characteristics ====

The B-25 was a safe and forgiving aircraft to fly. With an engine out, 60° banking turns into the dead engine were possible, and control could be easily maintained down to 145&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (230&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]). However, the pilot had to remember to maintain engine-out directional control at low speeds after take off with rudder - if this was attempted with ailerons, the aircraft would snap out of control. The tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. The only significant complaint about the B-25 was the extremely high noise level produced by its engines; as a result, many pilots eventually suffered from various degrees of [[hearing loss]].&lt;ref name = &quot;dbvxho&quot;&gt;Higham 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The high noise level was due to design and space restrictions in the engine cowlings which resulted in the exhaust &quot;stacks&quot; protruding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing. This directed exhaust and noise directly at the pilot and crew compartments. Crew members and operators on the airshow circuit frequently comment that &quot;the B-25 is the fastest way to turn aviation fuel directly into noise&quot;. Many B-25's now in civilian ownership have been modified with exhaust rings that direct the exhaust through the outboard bottom section of the cowling.

The Mitchell was also an amazingly sturdy aircraft and could withstand tremendous punishment. One well-known B-25C of the [[321st Bombardment Group|321st Bomb Group]] was nicknamed &quot;Patches&quot; because its crew chief painted all the aircraft's [[flak]] hole patches with high-visibility [[zinc chromate]] paint. By the end of the war, this aircraft had completed over 300 missions, was belly-landed six times and sported over 400 patched holes. The airframe was so bent, straight-and-level flight required 8° of left [[aileron]] trim and 6° of right rudder, causing the aircraft to &quot;crab&quot; sideways across the sky.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

An interesting characteristic of the B-25 was its ability to extend range by using one-quarter wing flap settings. Since the aircraft normally cruised in a slightly nose-high attitude, about 40&amp;nbsp;gal (150&amp;nbsp;l) of fuel was below the fuel pickup point and thus unavailable for use. The flaps-down setting gave the aircraft a more level flight attitude, which resulted in this fuel becoming available, thus slightly extending the aircraft's range.&lt;ref name = &quot;dbvxho&quot;/&gt;

By the time a separate [[United States Air Force]] was established in 1947, most B-25s had been consigned to long-term storage. However, a select number continued in service through the late 1940s and 1950s in a variety of training, reconnaissance and support roles. Its principal use during this period was for undergraduate training of multi-engine aircraft pilots slated for reciprocating engine or turboprop cargo, aerial refueling or reconnaissance aircraft. Still others were assigned to units of the [[Air National Guard]] in training roles in support of [[F-89 Scorpion]] and [[F-94 Starfire]] operations. [[B-25 Mitchell|TB-25J-25-NC Mitchell]], ''44-30854'', the last B-25 in the USAF inventory, assigned at [[March AFB]], California as of March 1960,&lt;ref&gt;Fort Walton Beach, Florida, &quot;Doolittle Park Will Have AF B-25 Bomber&quot;, ''Playground News'', Thursday, 10 March 1960, Volume 15, Number 7, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; was flown to [[Eglin AFB]], Florida, from [[Turner Air Force Base]], Georgia, on 21 May 1960, the last flight by a USAF B-25, and presented by Brig. Gen. A. J. Russell, Commander of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]]'s [[822d Air Division]] at Turner AFB, to the Air Proving Ground Center Commander, Brig. Gen. Robert H. Warren, who in turn presented the bomber to [[Valparaiso, Florida]] Mayor Randall Roberts on behalf of the Niceville-Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce. Four of the original [[Doolittle Raid|Tokyo Raiders]] were present for the ceremony, Col. Davy Jones, Col. Jack Simms, Lt. Col. Joseph Manske, and retired Master Sgt. Edwin W. Horton.&lt;ref&gt;Special, &quot;B-25 Makes Last Flight During Ceremony at Eglin&quot;, ''Playground News'', Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Thursday 26 May 1960, Volume 15, Number &quot;17&quot; (actually No. 18), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It was donated back to the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] circa 1974 and marked as Doolittle's ''40-2344''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warbirdregistry.org/b25registry/b25-4430854.html &quot;B-25 44-330854.&quot;] ''warbirdregistry.org''. Retrieved: 30 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many B-25s are kept in airworthy condition by air museums and collectors.

===US Navy and USMC===
The PBJ-1 was a navalized version of the USAAF B-25. It had its origin in a deal cut in mid-1942 between the Navy and the USAAF. As part of the deal, fifty B-25Cs and 152 B-25Ds were transferred to the Navy from the USAAF. The planes carried Navy serial numbers beginning with 34998. The first PBJ-1s arrived in February 1943. They were used by Marine Corps pilots, beginning with VMB-413. Many of them were equipped with a search [[radar]] with a retractable radome fitted in place of the ventral turret.

Large numbers of B-25H and J variants were delivered to the Navy as PBJ-1H and PBJ-1J respectively. These aircraft joined, but did not necessarily replace, the earlier PBJs. 

The PBJs were operated almost exclusively by the Marine Corps as land-based bombers. To operate them, the [[US Marine Corps]] established a number of bomber squadrons, beginning with VMB-413, in March 1943 at Cherry Point, North Carolina. Eight VMB squadrons were flying PBJs by the end of 1943, forming the initial Marine Medium Bombardment Group. Four more squadrons were in the process of formation in late 1945, but had not yet deployed by the time the war ended. 

Operational use of the Marine Corps PBJ-1s began in March 1944. The Marine PBJs operated from the [[Philippines]], [[Saipan]], [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Okinawa]] during the last few months of the Pacific war. Their primary mission was the long range [[interdiction]] of enemy shipping that was trying to run the blockade which was strangling Japan. The weapon of choice during these missions was usually the five-inch HVAR rocket, eight of which could be carried on underwing racks. Many of the PBJ-1C and D versions carried a rather ugly, bulbous antenna for an APS-3 search radar sticking out of the upper part of the transparent nose. On the PBJ-1H and J, the APS-3 search radar antenna was usually housed inside a ventral or wingtip radome. Some PBJ-1Js had their top turrets removed to save weight, especially toward the end of the war when Japanese fighters had become relatively scarce.

===Royal Air Force===
The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was an early customer for the B-25 via [[Lend-Lease]]. The RAF was the only force to use the B-25 on raids against Europe from bases in the United Kingdom, as the USAAF used the Martin B-26 Marauder for this purpose instead. 

The first Mitchells were designated Mitchell I by the RAF and were delivered in August 1941, to No 111 Operational Training Unit based in the Bahamas. These planes were used exclusively for training and familiarization and never achieved operational status. The B-25Cs and Ds were designated Mitchell II, altogether, 167 B-25Cs and 371 B-25Ds were delivered to the RAF. 

A total of 93 Mitchell Is and IIs had been delivered to the RAF by the end of 1942 and served with No. 2 Group, the RAF's tactical medium bomber force. The first RAF operation with the Mitchell II took place on January 22, 1943, when six aircraft attacked oil installations at [[Ghent]]. After the invasion of Europe, all four Mitchell squadrons moved to bases in France to support Allied ground forces. The British Mitchell squadrons were joined by No. 342 (Lorraine) Squadron of the [[French Air Force]] in April 1945. 

No 305 (Polish) Squadron flew Mitchell IIs from September to December 1943 before transitioning to Mosquitos. In addition to the 2nd Group, the B-25 was used by various second-line RAF units in the UK and abroad. In the Far East, No. 3 PRU, which consisted of Nos. 681 and 684 Squadrons, flew the Mitchell (primarily Mk IIs) on photographic reconnaissance sorties. 

The RAF was allocated 316 B-25Js as Mitchell IIIs. Deliveries took place between August 1944 and August 1945. However, only about 240 of these planes actually reached Britain, with some being diverted to No. 111 OTU in the Bahamas, some crashing during delivery and some being retained in the USA.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) was an important user of the B-25 Mitchell, although most of the RCAF use of the Mitchell was postwar. 

The first B-25s for the RCAF had originally been diverted to Canada from RAF orders. These included one Mitchell I, 42 Mitchell IIs, and 19 Mitchell IIIs. No 13 (P) Squadron was formed unofficially at Rockcliffe in May 1944. They operated Mitchell IIs on high altitude aerial photography sorties. They retained the Mitchell until October 1948. 

No 418 (Auxiliary) Squadron received its first Mitchell IIs in January 1947. It was followed by No 406 (auxiliary) which flew Mitchell IIIs from April 1947 to June 1958. No 418 Operated a mix of IIs and IIIs until March 1958. No 12 Squadron of Air Transport Command also flew Mitchell IIIs along with other types from September 1956 to November 1960. In 1951, the RCAF received an additional 75 B-25Js from USAF stocks to make good attrition and to equip various second-line units.

===Royal Australian Air Force ===
It was not until the spring of 1944 that the Australians were to get Mitchells. By the spring of 1944, No. 18 Squadron had more than enough Mitchells than which could be used by just one squadron, and could spare a few. Arrangements were made to re-equip the RAAF's No. 2 Squadron with these extra aircraft, replacing their Beauforts.

=== Dutch Air Force===
During the [[Second World War]], the Mitchell served in fairly large numbers with the air force of the Dutch government in exile. They participated in combat both in the East Indies as well as on the European front. Following the war, they were used in a vain attempt of the Dutch to retain control of Indonesia. 

On June 30, 1941, the Netherlands Purchasing Commission, acting on behalf of the Dutch government in exile in London, signed contract with North American Aviation for 162 B-25C aircraft. The planes were to be delivered to the Netherlands East Indies to help deter any Japanese aggression into the region. 

In February 1942 , the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) agreed to ferry 20 of the Dutch B-25s from Florida to Australia via Africa and India, and an additional ten via the South Pacific route from California. During March, five of the airplanes on the Dutch order had reached Bangalore, India and 12 had reached Archerfield in Australia. It was agreed that the B-25s in Australia would be used as the nucleus of a new squadron, designated No. 18. This squadron would be staffed jointly by Australian and Dutch aircrews plus a smattering of aircrews from other nations. 

It was agreed that the B-25s in Australia would be used as the nucleus of a new squadron, designated No. 18. This squadron would be staffed jointly by Australian and Dutch aircrews plus a smattering of aircrews from other nations, but would operate at least initially under Royal Australian Air Force command. However, the B-25s of No. 18 Squadron would be painted with the Dutch national insignia (at this time a rectangular Netherlands flag) and would carry NEIAF serials. 

Discounting the ten &quot;temporary&quot; B-25s delivered to 18 Squadron in early 1942, a total of 150 Mitchells were taken on strength by the NEIAF, 19 in 1942, 16 in 1943, 87 in 1944, and 28 in 1945. They flew bombing raids against Japanese targets in the East Indies. In 1944, the more capable B-25J Mitchell replaced most of the earlier C and D models. 

In June 1940, No 320 Squadron of the Royal Air Force had been formed from personnel formerly serving with the [[Royal Dutch Naval Air Service]] who had escaped to England after the German occupation of the Netherlands. Equipped with various British aircraft, No. 320 Squadron flew anti-submarine patrols, convoy escort missions, and performed air-sea rescue duties. They acquired the Mitchell II in September 1943, performing operations over Europe against gun emplacements, railway yards, bridges, troops and other tactical targets. They moved to Belgium in October 1944, and transitioned to the Mitchell III in 1945. No. 320 Squadron was disbanded in August 1945.

=== Soviet Air Force===
The US supplied 862 B-25 aircraft to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease during the Second World War. 

Other damaged aircraft arrived or crashed in the Far East of Russia, and one [[Doolittle Raid]] aircraft landed there short of fuel after attacking Japan. It is not known what happened to these latter aircraft.

=== China Air Force===
Well over 100 B-25Cs and Ds were supplied to the Nationalist Chinese during the Second World War. In addition, a total of 131 B-25Js were supplied to China under Lend-Lease. 

The 4 squadrons of the 1st BG (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th) of the 1st Medium Bomber Group were formed during the War. They formerly operated Russian-built Tupolev SB bombers, then transferred to the B-25. The 1st BG was under the command of CACW (Chinese-American Composite Wing) while operating B-25. Following the end of the war in the Pacific, these four bombardment squadrons were established to fight against the Communist insurgency that was rapidly spreading throughout the country. During the civil war, Chinese Mitchells fought alongside DeHavilland Mosquitos. 

In December 1948, the Nationalists were forced to move to the island of Taiwan, taking many of their Mitchells with them. However, some B-25s were left behind and were impressed into service with the air force of the new People's Republic of China.

===Brazilian Air Force ===
During the war, the Força Aérea Brasileira ([[Brazilian Air Force|FAB]]) received a few B-25s under Lend-Lease. Brazil declared war against the Axis powers in August 1942. FAB B-25s participated in the war against the U-boats in the southern Atlantic. The last Brazilian B-25 was finally declared surplus in 1970.

===Free French===
At least 21 Mitchell IIIs were issued by the Royal Air Force to No 342 Squadron, which was made up primarily of Free French aircrews. 

Following the liberation of France, this squadron was transferred to the newly formed French air force (Armee de l'Air) as GB I/20 Lorraine. These aircraft were operated by GB I/20 after the war, some being converted from bomber configuration into fast VIP transports. They were finally struck off charge in June 1947.

==Empire State Building incident==
{{main|B-25 Empire State Building crash}}
On Saturday, 28 July 1945, at 0940 (while flying in thick fog), a USAAF B-25D crashed into the north side of the [[Empire State Building]], hitting between the 79th and 80th floor. 14 people were killed &amp;mdash; 11 in the building, along with [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[William F.

;B-25
:The first version of the B-25 delivered. No [[prototype]]s were ordered. The first nine aircraft were built with constant [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] angle. Due to low stability, the wing was redesigned so that the dihedral was eliminated on the outboard section. (Number made: 24.)
;B-25A
:Version of the B-25 modified to make it combat ready; additions included [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s, crew armor, and an improved tail gunner station. No changes were made in the armament.  Re-designated obsolete ('''RB-25A''' designation) in 1942. (Number made: 40.)
;B-25B
:Rear turret deleted; manned dorsal and remotely-operated ventral turrets added, each with a pair of .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[machine gun]]s. The ventral turret was retractable, but the increased drag still reduced the cruise speed by 30&amp;nbsp;mph (48&amp;nbsp;km/h). 23 were delivered to the RAF as the '''Mitchell Mk I'''. [[Doolittle Raid|The Doolittle Raiders]] flew B-25Bs on their famous mission. (Number made: 120.)
;B-25C
:Improved version of the B-25B: powerplants upgraded from [[Wright R-2600]]-9 radials to R-2600-13s; de-icing and anti-icing equipment added; the navigator received a sighting blister; nose armament was increased to two .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns, one fixed and one flexible. The B-25C model was the first mass-produced B-25 version; it was also used in the United Kingdom (as the Mitchell II), in Canada, China, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union. First mass-produced B-25 model. (Number made: 1,625.)
;ZB-25C
;B-25D
:Identical to the B-25C, the only difference was that the B-25D was made in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], whereas the B-25C was made in [[Inglewood, California]]. First flew on 3 January 1942. (Number made: 2,290.)
;WB-25D
:In 1944, four B-25Ds were converted for weather reconnaissance by the [[53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]]. originally called the Army Hurricane Reconnaissance Unit, now called the &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot;. Weather recon first started in 1943 with the [[1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron|First Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]], with flights on the North Atlantic ferry routes.&lt;ref&gt;Robison, Tom.

.
;ZB-25D
;XB-25E
:Single B-25C modified to test de-icing and anti-icing equipment that circulated exhaust from the engines in chambers in the leading and trailing edges and empennage. The aircraft was tested for almost two years, beginning in 1942; while the system proved extremely effective, no production models were built that used it prior to the end of World War II. Many prop aircraft today use the XB-25E system. (Number made: 1, converted.)
;ZXB-25E
;XB-25F-A
:Modified B-25C that tested the use of insulated electrical de-icing coils mounted inside the wing and empennage leading edges as a de-icing system. The hot air de-icing system tested on the XB-25E was more practical. (Number made: 1, converted.)
;XB-25G
:Modified B-25C in which the transparent nose was replaced by a solid one carrying two fixed .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns and a 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) M4 cannon, then the largest weapon ever carried on an American bomber. (Number made: 1, converted.)
;B-25G
:To satisfy the dire need for ground-attack and strafing aircraft, the B-25G was made following the success of the prototype XB-25G. The production model featured increased armor and a greater fuel supply than the XB-25G. One B-25G was passed to the British, who gave it the name '''Mitchell II''' that had been used for the B-25C. (Number made: 420.)
;B-25H
[[Image:B-25 At Centennial.jpg|thumb|right|B-25H ''Barbie III'' taxiing at [[Centennial Airport]], Colorado]]
:An improved version of the B-25G. It featured two additional fixed .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose and four in fuselage-mounted pods; the heavy M4 cannon was replaced by a lighter 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) T13E1. (Number made: 1,000; number left flying in the world: 1.)
;B-25J
:The last production model of the B-25, often called a cross between the B-25C and the B-25H. It had a transparent nose, but many of the delivered aircraft were modified to have a solid nose. Most of its 14–18 machine guns were forward-facing for strafing missions. 316 were delivered to the [[Royal Air Force]] as the '''Mitchell III'''. (Number made: 4,318.)
;CB-25J
:Utility transport version.
;VB-25J
:A number of B-25s were converted for use as staff and VIP transports. [[Henry H. Arnold]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] both used converted B-25Js as their personal transports.

===Trainer variants===
Most models of the B-25 were used at some point as training aircraft.
;TB-25D
:Originally designated '''AT-24A''' (Advanced Trainer, Model 24, Version A). Trainer modification of B-25D. In total, 60 AT-24s were built.
;TB-25G
:Originally designated '''AT-24B'''. Trainer modification of B-25G.
;TB-25C
:Originally designated '''AT-24C'''. Trainer modification of B-25C.

;TB-25L
:Hayes pilot-trainer conversion. (Number made: 90.)
;TB-25M
:Hughes E5 fire-control radar trainer. (Number made: 40.)
;TB-25N
:Hayes navigator-trainer conversion. (Number made: 47.)

[[Image:PBJ Philippine guerillas 1945.jpg|thumb|Two PBJ-1Js on Mindanao,1945.]]
;PBJ-1C
:Similar to the B-25C for the US Navy; often fitted with airborne search radar and used in the anti-submarine role.
;PBJ-1D
:Similar to the B-25D for the US Navy and US Marine Corps. Differed in having a single .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine gun in the tail turret and beam gun positions similar to the B-25H. Often fitted with airborne search radar and used in the anti-submarine role.
;PBJ-1G
:US Navy/US Marine Corps designation for the B-25G
;PBJ-1H
:US Navy/US Marine Corps designation for the B-25H
;PBJ-1J
:US Navy designation for the B-25J-NC (Blocks -1 through -35) with improvements in radio and other equipment. Often fitted with &quot;package guns&quot; and wingtip search radar for the anti-shipping/anti-submarine role.

*One PBJ-1H was modified with carrier take-off and landing equipment and successfully tested on the [[USS Shangri-La]], but the Navy did not continue development.

{{Main|List of surviving B-25 Mitchells}}
There are more than one hundred surviving B-25 Mitchells scattered over the world, mainly in the United States. Most of them are on static display in museums, but about 45 are still airworthy.

A significant number of these were brought together for just a single movie. ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' is a 1970 [[war film]] adapted from the [[Catch-22|book of the same name]] by [[Joseph Heller]]. When ''Catch-22'' began preliminary production, Paramount made a decision to hire the [[Frank Tallman|Tallmantz Aviation]] organization to obtain sufficient B-25 Mitchell bomber aircraft. Tallmantz president, [[Frank Tallman|Frank G. Tallman]] ended up finding war-surplus aircraft, and eventually gathered not only pilots to fly the aircraft but also a ground support crew to maintain the fleet.

On 18 April 2010, 17 airworthy B-25s took off from the airfield behind the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] and flew over in formation to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the [[Doolittle Raid]]. Four of the surviving members of the Raid were in attendance for the reunion; Cole, Griffin, Hite and Thatcher, although Hite departed before the flyover. [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Michael Donley]], Commander of [[Air Force Material Command]] [[General]] [[Donald Hoffman]] and the Director of the National Museum of the United States Air Force [[Major General]] (ret.) [[Charles Metcalf]] were there also.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton Daily News 19 April 2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/b-25-bomber-fly-over-largest-of-its-kind-since-wwii-659788.html?imw=Y &quot;B-25 bomber fly-over largest of its kind since WWII&quot;].

[[Knight Bachelor|Sir]] '''Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Charlton''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 11 October 1937 in [[Ashington]], Northumberland) is an English former professional [[association football|football]] player who was a member of the England team who won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and was named the [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in 1966. He played almost all of his club football at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he became renowned for his attacking instincts from [[midfield]] and his ferocious long-range shot. 
His former team-mate at United, [[Johnny Giles]], in his new autobiography, titled 'A Football Man', describes Charlton as &quot;the greatest player I ever played with or against&quot;. His elder brother [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], who was also in the World Cup-winning team, is an  ex-defender for [[Leeds United]] and coach. 

He began to play for Manchester United's first team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the [[Munich air disaster]] of 1958. After helping United to win [[the Football League]] in 1965, he won a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] medal with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and another Football League title with United the following year. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]], scoring two goals in the final to help his team be the first English side to win the competition. He has scored more goals for England and United than any other player. Charlton held the record for most appearances for Manchester United (758),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Giggs nears Reds all-time record |publisher=BBC SPORT | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7382189.stm | date=3 May 2008 | accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was surpassed by [[Ryan Giggs]] on 21 May 2008 (the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]]). Charlton also held the club record for most league appearances (606) until this too was overtaken by [[Ryan Giggs]] on 6 March 2011. 

In January 2011 Charlton was voted the 4th greatest Manchester United player of all time by the readers of Inside United and ManUtd.com, behind [[Ryan Giggs]] (who topped the poll), [[Eric Cantona]] and [[George Best]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Giggs United's Greatest |publisher=ManUtd.com | url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Jan/Giggs-is-the-greatest.aspx?pageNo=2 | date=31 Jan 2011 | accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was the nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record has since been eclipsed by [[Bobby Moore]], [[Peter Shilton]] and then [[David Beckham]].

He left Manchester United to become manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for the 1973–74 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bobby Charlton |work=britannica.com/eb |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002215 |accessdate=28 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed to player-manager the following season, but early in the 1975–76 season left them after having decided management was not for him. He next accepted a post as a director with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], then became a member of Manchester United's board of directors in 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Bobby Charlton | work=fifaworldcup.yahoo.com| url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cp/eng/charlton.html | accessdate=23 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains one as of April 2011. He set goalscoring records for both the [[England national football team|England team]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with both records remaining intact some 35 years after the end of his playing career. He was knighted in 1994.

==Background==
Charlton was related to several professional footballers on his mother's side of the family: his uncles were [[Jack Milburn (footballer born 1908)|Jack Milburn]] (Leeds United and Bradford City), [[George Milburn]] (Leeds United and Chesterfield), [[Jim Milburn]] (Leeds United and Bradford City) and [[Stanley Milburn|Stan Milburn]] (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer [[Jackie Milburn]] was his mother's cousin. However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton 2007, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother, [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], initially went to work applying to the [[police|Police Service]] before also becoming a professional footballer with Leeds United.

On 9 February 1953, Bedlington Grammar School pupil Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] chief scout [[Joe Armstrong (football scout)|Joe Armstrong]]. Charlton went on to play for England schoolboys, and despite offers that followed from several other clubs, the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with [[Wilf McGuinness]], also aged 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=White |first=John D. T. |title=The Official Manchester United Almanac |edition=1st edition |date=29 May 2008 |publisher=Orion Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-7528-9192-7 |page=2 |chapter=January }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an [[apprenticeship]] as an electrical engineer; however he went on to turn professional in October 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton 2007, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton became one of the famed [[Busby Babes]], the collection of precociously talented footballers who emerged through the system at [[Old Trafford]] in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the Second World War. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his [[National Service]] with the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] in [[Shrewsbury]], where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United team-mate [[Duncan Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlton 2007, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5–1 away win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the February.

United won the [[The Football League|League championship]] but were denied the 20th century's first &quot;double&quot; when they controversially lost the 1957 [[FA Cup]] final to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper [[Ray Wood]] carried off with a broken [[cheek]]bone after a clash with Villa centre forward [[Peter McParland]]. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before [[substitute (soccer)|substitute]]s, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate [[Jackie Blanchflower]] who ended up between the posts.

Charlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]]. Previously, [[the Football Association]] had scorned the competition but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play [[Red Star Belgrade]]. In the first leg at home, United won 2–1. The return in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3–0 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3–3 draw. However, United maintained their [[aggregate score|aggregate]] lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] at the weekend.

==The Munich air disaster==
{{see also|Munich air disaster}}

The aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from [[Zemun|Zemun Airport]] needed to stop in [[Munich]] to refuel. This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.

The team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and teammate [[Dennis Viollet]] swapped places with [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[David Pegg]], who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane.

The plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.

Charlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper [[Harry Gregg]] (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.

Charlton suffered cuts to his head and severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain [[Roger Byrne]] was also killed, along with [[Mark Jones (footballer)|Mark Jones]], [[Liam Whelan|Billy Whelan]], [[Eddie Colman]] and [[Geoff Bent]]. [[Duncan Edwards]] died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that [[slush]] on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible.

Charlton was the first survivor to leave hospital. He arrived back in [[England]] on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season.

Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the semi-finals to a 5–2 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and [[Nat Lofthouse]] scored twice to give  [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] side a 2–0 win.

==United and England==
At the same time, Charlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the [[England national football team|England]] squad for a [[British Home Championship]] game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]]. It would be the start of a long, prolific, record-breaking and globally respected career for his country.

Charlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4–0, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger [[Tom Finney]]. He scored both goals in his second game as England beat [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 2–1 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to [[Belgrade]] to play his third match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. Unfortunately, England lost that game 5–0 and Charlton played poorly. He was selected for the squad which competed at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] in [[Sweden]], but didn't kick a ball, something at which critics expressed surprise and bewilderment,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} even allowing for his lacklustre performance in Belgrade.

Charlton began to settle back into his footballing life with Manchester United and England and enhanced his reputation as a scorer of great goals as well as a great goalscorer – rarely is a player regarded as both. In 1959 he scored a [[hat-trick]] as England demolished the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] 8–1; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8–0 thrashing of [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. He also managed to score in every [[British Home Championship]] tournament he played in except [[1963 British Home Championship|1963]] in an association with the tournament which lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and ten tournament victories (five shared).
[[File:Manchester The United trinity.jpg|thumb|upright|The &quot;United Trinity&quot; statue of Charlton (right) alongside [[Denis Law]] (centre) and [[George Best]] (left) outside [[Old Trafford]]]]
He played in qualifiers for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] in [[Chile]] against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3–1 group win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who went on to win the tournament.

Further success with Manchester United came at last when they beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 3–1 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. In between, there was the pressing matter for Charlton of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] for which England, as hosts, had not needed to qualify. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of ''[[Football Writers' Association|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]]'' and ''[[European Footballer of the Year|European Footballer Of The Year]]'' into the competition.

By now, England were coached by [[Alf Ramsey]] who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the [[committee]]-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection – it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Luckily for Charlton, he had all three.

A hat-trick in the 8–1 rout of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the [[Progression of England association football goalscoring record|record]] jointly held by [[Tom Finney]] and [[Nat Lofthouse]] and Charlton's 31st goal against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in October the same year gave him the record alone. Charlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] around him.  His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed [[Jimmy Greaves]], playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.

==World Cup winner==
England drew the opening game of the tournament 0–0 with Uruguay, and Charlton scored the first goal in the 2–0 win over Mexico. This was followed by an identical scoreline against [[France national football team|France]], allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals.

England defeated Argentina 1–0 – the game was the only one in which Charlton received a caution – and faced Portugal in the semi finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games for England.

Charlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by [[Roger Hunt]] had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from [[Geoff Hurst]]. Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] beckoned.

The final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young [[Franz Beckenbauer]] effectively marked each other out of the game. England won 4–2 after extra time.

==European Cup winner==
Charlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]; 2 [[cap (football)|caps]] later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]], who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.

In 1968, Manchester United reached the [[1968 European Cup Final|European Cup final]], ten seasons after Munich. Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so. On a highly emotional night at Wembley, Charlton scored twice in a 4–1 win after extra time against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and, as United captain, lifted the trophy. Weeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by [[Jimmy Greaves]]. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the [[1968 European Football Championship|1968 European Championships]] where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in [[Florence]] but he did not play in the semi-final itself having picked up an injury in a friendly against Sweden. England defeated the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] 2–0 in the third place match.

In 1969, Charlton was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to football. More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion. Inevitably, he scored. This was his 48th goal for his country – his 49th and final goal would follow a month later in a 4–0 win over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] during a warm-up tour for the [[Football World Cup 1970|1970 World Cup]], designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions. Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first – and still, to date, only – England player to feature in four World Cup squads.

==World Cup 1970 and retirement==
Shortly before the World Cup Charlton was involved in the [[Bogotá Bracelet]] incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store. Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release, while Charlton was not arrested.

England began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] in the final game of the group against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest.

England duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed [[Franz Beckenbauer]]'s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2–0 lead. Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with [[Colin Bell]] who further tested the German keeper [[Sepp Maier|Maier]] and also provided a great cross for [[Geoff Hurst]] who uncharacteristically squandered the chance. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice – a back header from [[Uwe Seeler]] made it 2–2 after which [[Gerd Müller]]'s goal finished England off. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.

Despite popular opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German. Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a [[BBC]] documentary. His [[Progression of England association football caps record|caps record]] lasted until 1973 when [[Bobby Moore]] overtook him, and Charlton currently lies fourth in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, [[David Beckham]] and [[Peter Shilton]], whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. As of April 2011, Charlton's goalscoring record still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Archive/|title=England Archive|accessdate=5 October 2008|publisher=The Football Association}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in [[Football in England|England]], and at several stages were battling against relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars [[George Best]] and [[Denis Law]], and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], saying that &quot;to do so would be hypocritical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title =Manchester United: The Betrayal of a Legend | pages =100–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the [[1972–73 in English football|1972–73 season]], having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances, a record which [[Ryan Giggs]] broke in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]]. His goalscoring record, however, is still intact by a comfortable margin.

His last game was against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], and before the game the BBC cameras for ''[[Match Of The Day]]'' captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative cigarette case.

==Later life==
[[Image:Bobby2.jpg|right|thumb|Charlton at an explosives demonstration for the Mines Advisory Group in 2008]]
Charlton became the manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1973, signing his former United and England team-mate [[Nobby Stiles]] as player-coach. His first season ended in relegation and although he began playing again he left Preston early in the 1975–76 season after a disagreement with the board over the transfer of [[John Bird (footballer)|John Bird]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.leylandguardian.co.uk/news/big_interview_john_bird_1_163431 |title=Big Interview – John Bird |newspaper=Leyland Guardian |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=no9AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2250%2C4339777 |title=Charlton wanted |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=24 |date=22 August 1975 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] that year and began a casual association with the [[BBC]] for punditry on matches which continued for many years. In early 1976, he scored once in 3 league appearances for [[Waterford United]].

In 1978 he made 1 appearance for [[Shrewsbury Town]] in a friendly against the [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] national team at [[Gay Meadow]], [[Shrewsbury]].

He then joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] as a director, and was briefly caretaker manager there. He then spent some time playing in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Seven of my former 1966 World Cup winning team mates all played in South Africa. |work=Soccer Through The Years |url=http://www.soccerthroughtheyears.com/reviews.html|accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also built up several businesses in areas such as travel, jewellery and hampers, and ran soccer schools in the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia and China. In 1984, he was invited to become member of the [[board of directors]] at Manchester United, partly because of his football knowledge and partly because it was felt that the club needed a &quot;name&quot; on the board after the resignation of [[Matt Busby|Sir Matt Busby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title =Manchester United: The Betrayal of a Legend | pages =181–182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains a director of Manchester United as of 2011 and his continued presence was a factor in placating many fans opposed to the club's takeover by [[Malcolm Glazer]]. Charlton led the Manchester United side in receiving the European Cup in 2008, 50 years on from the Munich air disaster – Charlton initially refused UEFA President [[Michel Platini]]'s offer of a winners' medal, having not participated in the match itself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Charlton helped to promote Manchester's bids for the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games and the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]], England's bid for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[London 2012 Olympic bid|London]]'s successful bid for the [[2012 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Charlton leads tributes to Banks |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4594202.stm | accessdate=28 January 2006 | date=9 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[knighthood]] in 1994 and was an Inaugural Inductee to the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002. On accepting his award he commented ''&quot;I'm really proud to be included in the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. It's a great honour. If you look at the names included I have to say I couldn't argue with them. They are all great players and people I would love to have played with.&quot;'' He is also the (honorary) president of the [[National Football Museum]], an organisation about which he said ''&quot;I can't think of a better Museum anywhere in the world.&quot;''. On 14 December 2008 Charlton was awarded the prestigious [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Charlton given BBC Lifetime award |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7775752.stm | accessdate=14 December 2008 | date=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2009, Charlton was given the freedom of the city of Manchester, stating &quot;I'm just so proud, it's fantastic. It's a great city. I have always been very proud of it.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Sir Bobby given freedom of city|publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7919176.stm | accessdate=2 March 2009 | date=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton is involved in a number of charitable activities including fund raising for cancer hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christie.nhs.uk/press/2004/080904_1.aspx PNHS Press release, Sir Bobby's Hole In One For Christie's]&lt;/ref&gt; and the land mine clearance charity [[Mines Advisory Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mag.org.uk/news.php?s=2&amp;p=8834 Yean Maly, CAMBODIA: Sir Bobby Charlton and Tony Hawk fly in]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He met his wife, Norma Ball, at an [[ice rink]] in Manchester and they married in 1961. They have two daughters – [[Suzanne Charlton|Suzanne]] and Andrea. Suzanne was a weather forecaster for the [[BBC]] during the 1990s.

In 2007, while publicising his forthcoming autobiography, Charlton revealed that he has a long-running feud with his brother, [[Jack Charlton|Jack]]. They have rarely spoken since a falling-out between his wife Norma and his mother Cissie (who died on 25 March 1996 at the age of 83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2156415,00.html |title=Sir Bobby reopens the family feud |accessdate=27 August 2007 |authorlink=David Smith |date=27 August 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlton did not see his mother after 1992 as a result of the feud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/mirror-football-blog/The-mums-of-Cristiano-Ronaldo-George-Best-Ashley-Cole-Bobby-and-Jack-Charlton-Frank-Lampard-Jose-Antonio-Reyes-Theo-Walcott-and-more-Football-s-10-most-important-mothers-article351987.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

It would appear that the two brothers are again on speaking terms, as Jack presented him with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008. He said that he was 'knocked out' as he was presented the award by his brother. He received a standing ovation as he stood waiting for his prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7775752.stm| title=Sports Personality 2008: Charlton given BBC Lifetime award| publisher=BBC| date=14 December 2008| accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton began to lose his hair in the early 1960s and for a while refused to go bald gracefully, sporting a style of stranded, isolated hairs which would often flop around when he was running before he would tug them back over his head. This style is today still known as &quot;the Bobby Charlton [[Comb over|Comb-Over]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Portrayal in television and film==
In the 2011 film [[United (TV drama)|''United'']], centred on the successes of the [[Busby Babes]] and the decimation of the team in the Munich crash, Charlton was portrayed by actor [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-13157526]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Barry Lyndon''''' is a 1975 [[period film]] directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] based on the 1844 novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] which recounts the exploits of an 18th century [[Ireland|Irish]] adventurer. [[Ryan O'Neal]] stars as Barry Lyndon.

The film had a modest commercial success and a mixed critical reception. Now it is seen as one of Kubrick's finest films. It was part of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s poll of the 100 best films as well as the ''[[Village Voice]]'' poll conducted in 1999 and was ranked #27 in ''[[Sight and Sound]]'''s 2002 [[film critics]] poll. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] has cited ''Barry Lyndon'' as his favorite Kubrick film. Quotations from it appeared in such disparate works as [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[The Duellists]]'', [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Age of Innocence (film)|The Age of Innocence]]'', [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' and [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[Dogville]]''.

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=October 2010}}
The film is divided into two halves each headed with a title card.

;I. By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon.

In 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry ([[Ryan O'Neal]]) is killed in a duel over a disputed horse sale. The widow ([[Marie Kean]]), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.

Barry falls in love with his cousin, Nora Brady ([[Gay Hamilton]]). She seduces him, but when the well-off English Captain John Quin ([[Leonard Rossiter]]) appears, Barry, who has no money, is dropped. Nora and her family plan to relieve their poverty with an advantageous marriage. Barry refuses to accept the situation and kills Quin in a [[duel]], apparently.

Barry flees to [[Dublin]], but en route is robbed of purse and equipment by a famous [[highwayman]], Captain Feeney ([[Arthur O'Sullivan]]). Broke, he joins the British army where a family friend, Captain Grogan ([[Godfrey Quigley]]), informs him that he did not kill Quin. His pistol was loaded with tow. The duel was stage-managed to get rid of Barry so Quin could marry Nora and repair her family's fortune.
Barry's regiment is sent to fight in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Grogan is fatally wounded in a skirmish with the French. Barry steals an officer courier's uniform, horse and identity and deserts. En route to Holland, then neutral, he encounters the Prussian, Captain Potzdorf ([[Hardy Krüger]]), who seeing through his disguise offers him the choice of being shot as a deserter or enlisting in the Prussian army. Barry enlists in his second army and saves Potzdorf's life in a skirmish.

After the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by the Prussian Police to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari ([[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]), a professional gambler. The Prussians suspect he is a spy and Barry is to verify this. Barry discovers the chevalier is Irish and they become confederates cheating at cards. They are discovered and expelled by the Prussians. Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas of Europe profiting from their gambling with Barry enforcing reluctant debtors with a duel.

Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. He encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon ([[Marisa Berenson]]), has little difficulty seducing her, and after her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon ([[Frank Middlemass]]), dies, marries her.

;II. Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon.
On marriage (1773), Barry takes the Countess' last name of Lyndon and settles in England to enjoy her wealth; he still has no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon ([[Dominic Savage]]), Lady Lyndon's 10-year-old son by Sir Charles, hates Barry, who regularly beats him. The marriage is unhappy. The Countess bears a son, Bryan Patrick. Barry enjoys spending his wife's money and is unfaithful, keeping his wife in dull seclusion. He later comes to his senses and apologises to her.

Some years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him. She warns her son that his position is precarious; If Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her son, Lord Bullingdon (now a young man, played by [[Leon Vitali]]); Barry would be left penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. He cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover ([[André Morell]]) with this goal in mind, spending much money to grease his way to the top. All this effort is wasted however. One day during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon, Lord Bullingdon announces his hatred of his stepfather and is beaten by Barry in front of many important guests. After this, Bullingdon leaves the family estate, and England itself, for places unknown. But Barry's public cruelty loses him all the powerful friends in high society he has worked so hard to make and he is shunned socially.

As badly as he has treated his stepson, Barry proves to be a compassionate and doting father to Bryan, with whom he now spends all his time. However, the day before his ninth birthday, the boy is thrown from his horse and later dies. The grief-stricken Barry turns to drink, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt ([[Murray Melvin]]), tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. However, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, partly because they no longer need a tutor and partly for fear that his influence is making Lady Lyndon worse. Plunging even deeper into grief, she attempts suicide. Upon hearing of this, Lord Bullingdon returns to England and challenges Barry to a duel.

Inside a barn, where the duel is held, a coin flip gives Bullingdon the privilege of shooting first, but his pistol misfires. Barry magnanimously [[Delope|fires into the ground]], but Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end there. He fires again, this time hitting Barry in the leg, which has to be [[amputation|amputated]] below the knee.

While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon takes control of the estate. He sends his accountant and emissary Graham ([[Philip Stone]]) to the cottage, where Barry is recovering, to offer him a deal: Bullingdon will grant Barry an [[Life annuity|annuity]] of 500 guineas for life if he leaves England forever and ends his marriage to Lady Lyndon; otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, his creditors and bill collectors will see to it that he is put in jail. Wounded in spirit and body, Barry reluctantly accepts the deal. He goes first to Ireland with his mother, then to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler, though without his former success. He never sees Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in 1789) shows the middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as Bullingdon looks on. 

One last title card closes the film:
;Epilogue...It was in the reign of [[King George III]] that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.

Critic Tim Robey suggests, in direct reference to ''Barry Lyndon'', that the film &quot;makes you realise that the most undervalued aspect of Kubrick's genius could well be his way with actors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; He adds that the [[supporting character|supporting cast]] is a &quot;glittering procession of [[cameo appearance|cameo]]s, not from star names but from vital character players.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

The cast featured Leon Vitali as the older Lord Bullingdon, who would then became Kubrick's [[personal assistant]], working as the [[casting director]] on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick. Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, [[John Alcott]], appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel. Kubrick's daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]] also appears (in an uncredited role) as a guest at Bryan's birthday party.

Kubrick stalwarts [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] (who had played the handicapped writer in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'') and [[Philip Stone]] (who had played Alex's father in ''A Clockwork Orange'', and would go on to play the dead caretaker Grady in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') also featured as the Chevalier du Balibari and the Lyndon family lawyer respectively.

==Production==
===Development===
After ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Kubrick made plans for a film about [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During pre-production, however, [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was released and subsequently failed at the box office. As a result, Kubrick's financiers pulled their funding for the film. He was furious, having put considerable time and effort into the development of the Napoleon project. Left with no alternative, he turned his attention to his next film, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, &quot;At one time, ''Vanity Fair'' interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film...as soon as I read ''Barry Lyndon'' I became very excited about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michel|title=Kubrick on Barry Lyndon|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html|accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Ciment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having garnered Oscar nominations for ''[[Dr Strangelove]]'', ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'', Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of &quot;a perfectionist [[auteur]] who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;&gt;Robey, Tim, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4524037/Barry-Lyndon-Kubricks-neglected-masterpiece.html &quot;Kubrick's Neglected Masterpiece&quot;], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] Review'' (31 January 2009), pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; His studio - Warner Bros. - was therefore &quot;eager to bankroll&quot; his next project, which Kubrick kept &quot;shrouded in secrecy&quot; from the press partly due to the furor surrounding the controversially violent ''A Clockwork Orange'' (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his &quot;long-standing [[paranoia]] about the [[tabloid press]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

Having felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 &quot;[[satire|satirical]] picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue,&quot; ''Barry Lyndon'', the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research Kubrick had done for the now-aborted ''Napoleon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; At the time, Kubrick merely announced only that his next film would star [[Ryan O'Neal]] (deemed &quot;a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;) and [[Marisa Berenson]], a former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover model, and be shot largely in Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that &quot;Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

===Principal photography===
Principal photography took 300 days, from spring 1973 through early 1974, with a break for Christmas.

Many of the film's exteriors were shot in Ireland, playing &quot;itself, England, and [[Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; Drawing inspiration from &quot;the [[landscape painting|landscape]]s of [[Watteau]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]],&quot; Kubrick and cinematographer Alcott also relied on the &quot;scrupulously researched [[art director|art direction]]&quot; of Ken Adams and Roy Walker.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; Alcott, Adams and Walker would be among those who would win [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their &quot;amazing work&quot; on the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

Several of the interior scenes were filmed in [[Powerscourt House]], a famous 18th century mansion in [[County Wicklow]], [[Republic of Ireland]]. The house was destroyed in an accidental fire several months after filming (November 1974), so the film serves as a record of the lost interiors, particularly the &quot;Saloon&quot; which was used for more than one scene. The [[Wicklow Mountains]] are visible, for example, through the window of the Saloon during a scene set in Berlin. Other locations included [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Castle Howard]] (exteriors of the Lyndon estate), [[Corsham Court]] (various interiors and the music room scene), [[Petworth House]] (chapel, and so on.), [[Stourhead]] (lake and temple), [[Longleat]], and [[Wilton House]] (interior and exterior) in England, [[Dunrobin Castle]] (exterior and garden as [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]]) in Scotland, [[Dublin Castle]] in Ireland (the chevalier's home), [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] near [[Stuttgart]] and [[Frederick the Great]]'s [[New Palace (Potsdam)|Neues Palais]] at [[Potsdam]] near [[Berlin]]. Some exterior shots were also filmed at [[Waterford City|Waterford]] Castle (now a luxury hotel and golf course) and [[Little Island, Waterford|Island]]. [[Moorstown Castle]] in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] also featured.

===Cinematography===
The film—as with &quot;almost every Kubrick film&quot;—is a &quot;showcase for [a] major innovation in technique.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; While ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' had featured &quot;revolutionary effects,&quot; and ''The Shining'' would later feature heavy use of the [[Steadicam]], ''Barry Lyndon'' saw a considerable number of sequences shot &quot;without recourse to electric light.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; [[Cinematography]] was overseen by director of photography [[John Alcott]] (who won an Oscar for his work), and is particularly noted for the technical innovations that made some of its most spectacular images possible. To achieve photography without electric lighting &quot;[f]or the many densely furnished interior scenes... meant shooting by [[candle]]light,&quot; which is known to be difficult in [[photography|still photography]], &quot;let alone with moving images.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Barry12.jpg|thumb|left|Special lenses were developed for ''Barry Lyndon'' to allow filming using only natural light.]]
Kubrick was &quot;determined not to reproduce the set-bound, artificially lit look of other [[costume drama]]s from that time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; After &quot;tinker[ing] with different combinations of [[Photographic lens|lenses]] and [[film stock]],&quot; the production got hold of three &quot;super-fast 50mm&quot; {{f/|0.7|link=yes}} lenses &quot;developed by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] for use by [[NASA]] in the [[Apollo moon landing]]s,&quot; which Kubrick had discovered in his search for low-light solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm Two Special Lenses for &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;], by Ed DiGiulio (President, Cinema Products Corp.), ''American Cinematographer''&lt;/ref&gt; These super-fast lenses &quot;[w]ith their huge [[lens aperture|aperture]] [the film actually features the largest lens aperture in film history] and fixed [[focal length]]&quot; were problematic to mount,&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; but allowed Kubrick and Alcott to shoot scenes lit with actual candles to an average lighting volume of only three [[candlepower]], &quot;recreating the huddle and glow of a pre-electrical age.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:William Hogarth 035.jpg|thumb|right|Hogarth's ''The Country Dance'' (c.1745) illustrates the type of interior scene that Kubrick sought to emulate with ''Barry Lyndon''.]]Although Kubrick's express desire was to avoid electric lighting where possible, most shots were achieved with conventional lenses and lighting, but were lit to deliberately mimic natural light rather than for compositional reasons. In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing &quot;a lot to [[William Hogarth]], with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; In the words of critic Tim Robey, the film has a &quot;stately, painterly, often determinedly static quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; For example, to help light some interior scenes, lights were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do. One telltale sign of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.

Despite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights. This helped the film &quot;fit... perfectly with Kubrick's gilded-cage aesthetic - the film is consciously a museum piece, its characters pinned to the frame like butterflies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

===Music===
The film's period setting allowed Kubrick to indulge his penchant for classical music, and the film score uses pieces by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (an arrangement of the Concerto for violin and oboe in C minor), [[Frederick the Great]] (''[[Hohenfriedberger Marsch]]''), [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (Cello Concerto in E-Minor, a transcription of the Cello Sonata in E Minor RV 40), [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Franz Schubert]] (German Dance No. 1 in C&amp;nbsp;major, [[Piano Trio No. 2 (Schubert)|Piano Trio in E-Flat, Opus 100]] and [[Impromptus (Schubert)#Four Impromptus, Op. 90 (D. 899)|Impromptu No. 1 in C minor]]). The piece most associated with the film, however, is the main title music: [[George Frideric Handel]]'s stately ''[[Sarabande]]'' from the [[Keyboard suite in D minor (HWV 437)|Suite in D minor HWV 437]]. Originally for solo [[harpsichord]], the versions for the main and end titles are performed very [[romantic music|romantically]] with orchestral strings, harpsichord, and [[timpani]]. It is used at various points in the film, in various arrangements, to indicate the implacable working of impersonal fate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The score also includes [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]] arranged by [[Paddy Moloney]] and performed by [[The Chieftains]]. Another very famous piece in the soundtrack is called ''[[Women of Ireland]]'', by [[Seán Ó Riada]], played by The Chieftains.

==Reception==
The film &quot;was not the commercial success [[Warner Bros.]] had been hoping for&quot; within the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; although it fared better in [[Europe]]. This mixed reaction saw the film (in the words of one retrospective review) &quot;greeted, on its release, with dutiful admiration - but not love. Critics... rail[ed] against the perceived coldness of Kubrick's style, the film's self-conscious artistry and slow pace. Audiences, on the whole, rather agreed...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; This &quot;air of disappointment&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; factored into Kubrick's decision to next film [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' — a project that would not only please him artistically, but also be more likely to succeed financially. Still, several other critics, including [[Gene Siskel]], praised the film's technical quality and strong narrative, and Siskel himself counted it as one of the five best films of the year.

[[Roger Ebert]] added this film to his 'Great Movies' list on September 9, 2009, writing, &quot;It defies us to care, it asks us to remain only observers of its stately elegance&quot;, and it &quot;must be one of the most beautiful films ever made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090909/REVIEWS08/909099993/1023|accessdate=September 25, 2010|publisher=rogerebert.chicagosuntimes.com|title=Barry Lyndon (1975)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
The film received [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] ([[Ken Adam]], [[Roy Walker (production designer)|Roy Walker]], [[Vernon Dixon]]), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[John Alcott]]), [[Academy Award for Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] ([[Milena Canonero]], [[Ulla-Britt Söderlund]]) and [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Musical Score]] ([[Leonard Rosenman]], &quot;for his arrangements of [[Schubert]] and [[Handel]]&quot;.)&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; Kubrick was nominated three times, for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/4004/Barry-Lyndon/awards |title=NY Times: Barry Lyndon |accessdate=2008-12-29|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Award for Best Direction]]. John Alcott won for [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. ''Barry Lyndon'' was also nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], Art Direction, and [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Costume Design]].

==Source novel==
Stanley Kubrick based his original screenplay on [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (republished as the novel ''Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.),'' a [[picaresque]] tale written and published in serial form in 1844. The serial, which is told in the first person and &quot;edited&quot; by the fictional George Savage FitzBoodle, concerns a member of the Irish [[gentry]] trying to become a member of the English aristocracy.

The source novel is written by Lyndon while imprisoned looking back on his life. Lyndon is a notable example of the literary device of the [[unreliable narrator]] – throughout the novel the reader is constantly asked to question the veracity of the events described by him. Although later editions dropped the frame device of FitzBoodle's (Thackeray's pseudonym) editions, it is crucial in unmasking Lyndon's [[narcissism]] through occasional notes inserted at the bottom of the page noting information that is contradictory or inconsistent in relation to what Lyndon writes elsewhere. As Andrew Sanders argues in his introduction for the Oxford Classics edition, these annotations were relevant to the novel as an ingenious narrative device as Thackeray constantly invites the reader to question Lyndon's version of the events.

Kubrick however felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title=visual-memory.co.uk |publisher=visual-memory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in the case of most literary adaptations, Kubrick shortens or in some cases omits characters who were significant in the novel. The time period constituting his escape from the Prussian army to his marriage is given greater detail in the novel than the film.

It is also interesting to note that the film ends much before the novel's ending. At the end of the film, Barry Lyndon survives with an amputated leg from a duel (an incident absent in the novel) and returns to his gambling lifestyle with lesser success while Lady Lyndon pays the debts accumulated during her marriage to Barry, including the sum promised to Redmond in return for leaving the country. Though these events occur in the novel as well, Thackeray also writes that upon Lady Lyndon's death, the sum promised to Barry is cancelled and he becomes destitute eventually winding up in prison for his confidence schemes. It is at this place where Barry writes his memoirs, which end noting that he has to 'eke out a miserable existence, quite unworthy of the famous and fashionable Barry Lyndon'.

At this point Fitz-Boodle writes an epilogue of sorts about Barry's final days, where his only visitor is his mother. He dies after spending 19 years in prison.

Thackeray based the novel on the life and exploits of the Irish [[rake (character)|rakehell]] and fortunehunter [[Andrew Robinson Stoney]], who married (and subsequently was divorced by) [[Mary Eleanor Bowes]], the Countess of Strathmore, who became known as &quot;The Unhappy Countess&quot; due to the tempestuous liaison.

The revised version, which is the novel that the world generally knows as ''Barry Lyndon'', was shorter and tighter than the original serialization, and dropped the FitzBoodle, Ed. device. It generally is considered the first &quot;novel without a hero&quot; or novel with an [[antihero]] in the English language. Upon its publication in 1856, it was entitled by Thackeray's publisher ''The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq. Of The Kingdom Of Ireland Containing An Account of His Extraordinary Adventures; Misfortunes; His Sufferings In The Service Of His Late Prussian Majesty; His Visits To Many Courts of Europe; His Marriage and Splendid Establishments in England And Ireland; And The Many Cruel Persecutions, Conspiracies And Slanders Of Which He Has Been A Victim''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/wmt/pva185.html The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barry Lyndon'' departs from its source novel in several ways. In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a raconteur and an unreliable narrator. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor [[Michael Hordern]]), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an [[omniscient narrator|omniscient]], although not entirely impartial, narrator. This change in perspective alters the tone of the story; Thackeray tells a jaunty, humorous tale, but Kubrick's telling is essentially [[tragedy|tragic]], with many subtle humorous jabs toward 18th century society, such as how Barry tries to learn the correct behavior for a gentleman, and pays a huge price when he does so.

Kubrick also changed the plot. The novel does not include a final duel. By adding this episode, Kubrick establishes dueling as the film's central motif: the film begins with a duel where Barry's father is shot dead, and duels recur throughout the film. Also, in Thackeray's novel, the Chevalier de Balibari (played by Patrick Magee in the film) is Barry's long-lost uncle (&quot;Balibari&quot; being a gentrified version of &quot;Bally Barry,&quot; the family's home), and by marrying into the Lyndons, Barry intends to regain his family fortune (his ancestors were dispossessed by the Lyndons). In the film, Kubrick eliminated these familial connections from the story.

The word ''cell'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''cellula'', meaning, a small room. The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by [[Robert Hooke]] in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the [[Cork (material)|cork]] cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooke&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;cite&gt;... I could exceedingly plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular [..] these pores, or cells, [..] were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this. . .&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; – Hooke describing his observations on a thin slice of cork.

==Anatomy==
There are two types of cells: eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually independent, while eukaryotic cells are often found in multicellular organisms.

===Prokaryotic cells===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}
[[Image:Average prokaryote cell- en.svg|thumb|400px|right|Diagram of a typical [[prokaryotic]] cell]]
The [[prokaryote]] cell is simpler, and therefore smaller, than a eukaryote cell, lacking a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and most of the other [[organelle]]s of eukaryotes. There are two kinds of prokaryotes: [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]; these share a similar structure.

Nuclear material of prokaryotic cell consist of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with cytoplasm. Here, the undefined nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called [[nucleoid]].

A prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions:
* On the outside, [[flagella]] and [[Pilus|pili]] project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells;
* Enclosing the cell is the [[cell envelope]] – generally consisting of a [[cell wall]] covering a [[plasma membrane]] though some bacteria also have a further covering layer called a [[bacterial capsule|capsule]]. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. Though most prokaryotes have a cell wall, there are exceptions such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' (bacteria) and ''[[Thermoplasma]]'' (archaea). The cell wall consists of ''[[peptidoglycan]]'' in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and finally bursting ([[cytolysis]]) from [[osmotic pressure]] against a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment. Some eukaryote cells ([[plant cell]]s and [[fungi]] cells) also have a cell wall;
* Inside the cell is the [[cytoplasm|cytoplasmic region]] that contains the [[genome|cell genome]] (DNA) and ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. A [[Chromosome#Chromosomes_in_prokaryotes|prokaryotic chromosome]] is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', which causes Lyme disease). Though not forming a ''nucleus'', the [[DNA]] is condensed in a ''nucleoid''. Prokaryotes can carry [[extrachromosomal DNA]] elements called ''[[plasmid]]s'', which are usually circular. Plasmids enable additional functions, such as [[antibiotic resistance]].

===Eukaryotic cells===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}
[[Image:Biological cell.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of a typical [[animalia|animal]] ([[eukaryotic]]) cell, showing subcellular components.

[[Organelle]]s:&lt;br/&gt;
(1) [[nucleolus]]&lt;br/&gt;
(2) [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]&lt;br/&gt;
(3) [[ribosome]]&lt;br/&gt;
(4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]&lt;br/&gt;
(5) [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER)&lt;br/&gt;
(6) [[Golgi apparatus]]&lt;br/&gt;
(7) [[Cytoskeleton]]&lt;br/&gt;
(8) [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]]&lt;br/&gt;

(11) [[cytoplasm]]&lt;br/&gt;
(12) [[lysosome]]&lt;br/&gt;
(13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]]]]

[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells are about 15 times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. The major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a [[cell nucleus]], a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means &quot;true nucleus.&quot;  Other differences include:
* The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.
* The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called [[chromosome]]s, which are associated with [[histone]] proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the ''[[cell nucleus]]'', separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic [[organelle]]s such as [[mitochondria]] also contain some DNA.
* Many eukaryotic cells are [[cilium|ciliated]] with ''primary cilia''.  Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, [[mechanosensation]], and thermosensation.  Cilia may thus be &quot;viewed as sensory cellular [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christenson2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Subcellular components==
[[Image:celltypes.svg|thumb|300px|The cells of [[eukaryote]]s (left) and [[prokaryote]]s (right)]]
All cells, whether [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]], have a [[cell membrane|membrane]] that envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the [[cell potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess [[DNA]], the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describe their function.

===Membrane===
{{Main|Cell membrane}}
The cytoplasm of a cell is surrounded by a cell membrane or ''plasma membrane''. The plasma membrane in plants and prokaryotes is usually covered by a [[cell wall]]. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a [[lipid bilayer|double layer of lipids]] ([[hydrophobic]] fat-like molecules) and [[hydrophilic]] [[phosphorus]] molecules. Hence, the layer is called a [[phospholipid bilayer]]. It may also be called a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of [[protein]] molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance ([[molecule]] or [[ion]]) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Transmembrane receptors|receptor]] proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as [[hormone]]s.

===Cytoskeleton===
{{Main|Cytoskeleton}}
[[File:DAPIMitoTrackerRedAlexaFluor488BPAE.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bovine Pulmonary Artery Endothelial cell: nuclei stained blue, [[mitochondria]] stained red, and [[F-actin]], an important component in microfilaments, stained green. Cell imaged on a fluorescent microscope.]]
The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during [[endocytosis]], the uptake of external materials by a cell, and [[cytokinesis]], the separation of daughter cells after [[cell division]]; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of [[microfilament]]s, [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s. There is a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michie K, Löwe J |title=Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=467–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16756499 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic material===
Two different kinds of genetic material exist: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). Most organisms use DNA for their long-term information storage, but [[RNA virus|some viruses]] (e.g., [[retrovirus]]es) have RNA as their genetic material. The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA sequence. RNA is also used for information transport (e.g., [[mRNA]]) and [[enzyme|enzymatic]] functions (e.g., [[ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA) in organisms that use [[DNA]] for the genetic code itself. [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein [[translation]].

Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial [[chromosome]]) in the [[nucleoid region]] of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called [[chromosome]]s inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] (see [[endosymbiotic theory]]).

A human cell has genetic material contained in the [[cell nucleus]] (the [[genome|nuclear genome]]) and in the mitochondria (the [[mitochondrial genome]]). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 23 pairs of linear DNA molecules called [[chromosome]]s. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the [[mitochondrial DNA]] is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.

Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called [[transfection]]. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's [[genome]], or stable, if it is. Certain [[virus]]es also insert their genetic material into the genome.

===Organelles===
{{Main|Organelle}}
The human body contains many different [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function. Cells also have a set of &quot;little organs,&quot; called [[organelle]]s, that are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles but organelles in eukaryotes are generally more complex and may be membrane bound.

There are several types of organelles in a cell.  Some (such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[golgi apparatus]]) are typically solitary, while others (such as [[mitochondria]], [[peroxisomes]] and [[lysosomes]]) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands).  The [[cytosol]] is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.

{|
|-
|
; Cell nucleus – eukaryotes only - a cell's information center : The [[cell nucleus]] is the most conspicuous organelle found in a [[eukaryotic]] cell. It houses the cell's [[chromosomes]], and is the place where almost all [[DNA]] replication and [[RNA]] synthesis ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the [[nuclear envelope]]. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, [[DNA]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]], or copied into a special [[RNA]], called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The [[nucleolus]] is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the [[cytoplasm]].
|[[Image:Diagram human cell nucleus no text.png|thumb|Diagram of a cell nucleus]]
|-
|
; Mitochondria and Chloroplasts – eukaryotes only - the power generators : [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria play a critical role in generating energy in the eukaryotic cell. Mitochondria generate the cell's energy by [[oxidative phosphorylation]], using [[oxygen]] to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to [[glucose]]) to generate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Mitochondria multiply by splitting in two. Respiration occurs in the cell mitochondria.

:Organelles that are modified chloroplasts are broadly called [[plastid]]s, and are involved in energy storage through [[photosynthesis]], which uses solar energy to generate carbohydrates and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

:Mitochondria and [[chloroplast]]s each contain their own genome, which is separate and distinct from the nuclear genome of a cell. Both organelles contain this DNA in circular plasmids, much like prokaryotic cells, strongly supporting the evolutionary theory of [[endosymbiosis]]; since these organelles contain their own genomes and have other similarities to prokaryotes, they are thought to have developed through a symbiotic relationship after being engulfed by a primitive cell.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
|-
|
; Endoplasmic reticulum – eukaryotes only : The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is the transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface and secretes proteins into the cytoplasm, and the smooth ER, which lacks them. Smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release.
|-
|
; Golgi apparatus – eukaryotes only : The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s that are synthesized by the cell. It is particularly important in the processing of proteins for [[secretion]]. The Golgi apparatus forms a part of the [[endomembrane system]] of eukaryotic cells. [[vesicle (biology)|Vesicle]]s that enter the Golgi apparatus are processed in a cis to trans direction, meaning they coalesce on the cis side of the apparatus and after processing pinch off on the opposite (trans) side to form a new vesicle in the animal cell.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
|[[Image:Endomembrane system diagram no text nucleus.png|thumb|Diagram of an endomembrane system]]
|-
|
; Ribosomes : The [[ribosome]] is a large complex of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules. They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ménétret JF, Schaletzky J, Clemons WM, ''et al.'' |title=Ribosome binding of a single copy of the SecY complex: implications for protein translocation |journal=Mol.

; Lysosomes and Peroxisomes – eukaryotes only : [[Lysosome]]s contain [[digestive enzyme]]s (acid [[hydrolase]]s). They digest excess or worn-out [[organelle]]s, food particles, and engulfed [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]]. [[Peroxisome]]s have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic [[peroxide]]s. The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system. These organelles are often called a &quot;suicide bag&quot; because of their ability to detonate and destroy the cell.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

; Centrosome – the cytoskeleton organiser : The [[centrosome]] produces the [[microtubules]] of a cell – a key component of the [[cytoskeleton]]. It directs the transport through the [[endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Centrosomes are composed of two [[centrioles]], which separate during [[cell division]] and help in the formation of the [[mitotic spindle]]. A single centrosome is present in the [[animal cell]]s.

The vacuoles of eukaryotic cells are usually larger in those of plants than animals.

==Structures outside the cell wall==
===Capsule===
A gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell wall. The capsule may be [[polysaccharide]] as in [[pneumococci]], [[meningococci]] or [[polypeptide]] as ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' or [[hyaluronic acid]] as in [[streptococci]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
Capsules are not marked by ordinary stain and can be detected by [[India ink#Uses other than writing|special stain]]. The capsule is [[antigenic]]. The capsule has [[antiphagocytic]] function so it determines the virulence of many bacteria. It also plays a role in attachment of the organism to mucous membranes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Flagella===
&lt;!-- non-motile cilia also operate, principally as sensory organelles, outside of cell walls --&gt;
[[Flagella]] are the organelles of cellular mobility. They arise from cytoplasm and extrude through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. Are most commonly found in bacteria cells but are found in animal cells as well.

===Fimbriae (pili)===
They are short and thin hair like filaments, formed of protein called pilin (antigenic). [[Fimbriae]] are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (adherence). There are special types of pili called (sex pili) involved in conjunction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Functions==
===Growth and metabolism===
{{Main|Cell growth|Metabolism}}
Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: [[catabolism]], in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and [[anabolism]], in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.
Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically complex sugar molecule called [[glucose]]. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), a form of energy, through two different pathways.

The first pathway, [[glycolysis]], requires no oxygen and is referred to as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]]. Each reaction is designed to produce some hydrogen ions that can then be used to make energy packets (ATP). In prokaryotes, glycolysis is the only method used for converting energy.

The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle, or [[citric acid cycle]], occurs inside the mitochondria and can generate enough ATP to run all the cell functions.

[[Image:Proteinsynthesis.png|frame|100px|An overview of protein synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;Within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the cell (''light blue''), [[gene]]s (DNA, ''dark blue'') are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature [[mRNA]] (''red'') that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the [[cytoplasm]] (''peach''), where it undergoes [[translation (genetics)|translation]] into a protein. mRNA is translated by [[ribosome]]s (''purple'') that match the three-base [[codon]]s of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate [[transfer RNA|tRNA]]. Newly synthesized proteins (''black'') are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule (''orange''), to become fully active.]]

===Creation===
{{Main|Cell division}}
Cell division involves a single cell (called a ''mother cell'') dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in [[multicellular organism]]s (the growth of [[biological tissue|tissue]]) and to procreation ([[vegetative reproduction]]) in [[unicellular organism]]s.

[[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells divide by [[binary fission]]. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called [[mitosis]], followed by division of the cell, called [[cytokinesis]]. A [[diploid]] cell may also undergo [[meiosis]] to produce haploid cells, usually four. [[Haploid]] cells serve as [[gamete]]s in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.

[[DNA replication]], or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, is required every time a cell divides. Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.

===Protein synthesis===
{{Main|Protein biosynthesis}}
Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called [[ribosome]]s located in the [[cytosol]], where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.

==Movement or motility ==
Cells can move during many processes: such as wound healing, the immune response and [[cancer metastasis]]. For wound healing to occur, white blood cells and cells that ingest bacteria move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection.&lt;br /&gt;
At the same time fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) move there to remodel damaged structures. In the case of tumor development, cells from a primary tumor move away and spread to other parts of the body. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Revathi Ananthakrishnan1 *, Allen Ehrlicher2 &amp;#x2709; |url=http://www.biolsci.org/v03p0303.htm |title=The Forces Behind Cell Movement |publisher=Biolsci.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlbertsB&quot;&gt;Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J. et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4e.

==Evolution==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Timeline of evolution]] --&gt;
{{Main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, which began the [[timeline of evolution|history of life]] on Earth.

===Origin of the first cell===
{{further|[[Abiogenesis]]}}

There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that could lead to life in an early Earth. One is that they came from meteorites (''see [[Murchison meteorite]]''). Another is that they were created at [[Hydrothermal vent|deep-sea vents]]. A third is that they were synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere (''see [[Miller–Urey experiment]]''); although it is not clear if Earth had such an atmosphere. There are essentially no experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. [[RNA]] is generally assumed the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions (''see [[RNA world hypothesis]]''). But some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, like [[Abiogenesis#Clay_theory|clay]] or [[peptide nucleic acid]].&lt;ref name=OrgelLE&gt;{{cite journal | title=The origin of life--a review of facts and speculations| author=Orgel LE| journal=Trends Biochem Sci| year=1998| volume=23| pages=491–5| pmid=9868373 | doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01300-0 | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells emerged at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. The current belief is that these cells were [[heterotroph]]s. An important characteristic of cells is the [[cell membrane]], composed of a bilayer of [[lipid]]s. The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s in water, and could have preceded RNA. But the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Griffiths G |title=Cell evolution and the problem of membrane topology |journal=Nature reviews. Molecular cell biology |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=1018–24 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17971839 |doi=10.1038/nrm2287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of eukaryotic cells===
The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a [[symbiosis|symbiotic community]] of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the [[mitochondria]] and the [[chloroplasts]] are almost certainly what remains of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing [[proteobacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]], respectively, where the rest of the cell appears derived from an ancestral [[archaea]]n prokaryote cell&amp;mdash;an idea called the ''[[endosymbiotic theory]]''.

There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the [[hydrogenosome]] predated the origin of [[mitochondria]], or viceversa: see the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

Sex, as the stereotyped choreography of meiosis and syngamy that persists in nearly all extant eukaryotes, may have played a role in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. An 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory suggests that the eukaryote genome accreted from prokaryan parasite genomes in numerous rounds of lateral gene transfer. Sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing co-evolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that conveyed protection against horizontal infection by more virulent symbionts.&lt;ref name=&quot;sterrer&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Sterrer W | title = On the origin of sex as vaccination | journal =  Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 216 | pages = 387–396 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12151256  | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* 1632–1723: [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] teaches himself to grind [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], builds a [[microscope]] and draws [[protozoa]], such as ''[[Vorticella]]'' from rain water, and [[Bacterium|bacteria]] from his own mouth.
* 1665: [[Robert Hooke]] discovers cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early microscope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooke&quot; /&gt;
* 1839: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory.
* The belief that life forms can occur spontaneously (''[[Abiogenesis|generatio spontanea]]'') is contradicted by [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) (although [[Francesco Redi]] had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion).
* 1855: [[Rudolf Virchow]] states that cells always emerge from [[cell division]]s (''omnis cellula ex cellula'').
* 1931: [[Ernst Ruska]] builds first [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) at the [[University of Berlin]]. By 1935, he has built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles.
* 1953: [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] made their first announcement on the double-[[helix]] structure for DNA on February 28.
* 1981: [[Lynn Margulis]] published ''Symbiosis in Cell Evolution'' detailing the [[endosymbiotic theory]].

'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''''' is a 1992 American  [[Action film|action]]/[[Comedy film|comedy]]/[[horror film]] about a [[Valley girl]] [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] named [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] ([[Kristy Swanson]]) who learns that it is her fate to hunt [[vampires]]. The original [[script (recorded media)|script]] for the film was written by [[Joss Whedon]], who later created the darker and more acclaimed [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|TV series of the same name]] starring [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Buffy. It was a moderate success at the box office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=buffythevampireslayer.htm|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) Weekend Box Office|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mixed reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/buffy_the_vampire_slayer/|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] ([[Kristy Swanson]]) is a stereotypical [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] at Hemery High School in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. She is a carefree popular girl whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her friends. While at school one day, she is approached by a man named [[Minor characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer#Merrick|Merrick Jamison-Smythe]] ([[Donald Sutherland]]). He informs her that she is [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|The Slayer]], or chosen one, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially refuses to believe his claims, but becomes convinced when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in great detail. Over the course of her training she becomes friends with [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Pike|Oliver Pike]] ([[Luke Perry]]), whose best friend has recently become a vampire. Oliver becomes the male equivalent of the traditional &quot;[[damsel in distress]]&quot;, being rescued by Buffy or Merrick on several occasions.  However, their relationship gradually becomes romantic and Oliver becomes her partner in fighting the undead.

After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with a local vampire king named Lothos ([[Rutger Hauer]]), who has killed a number of past Slayers. Lothos eventually kills Merrick as well, giving her the motivation she needs to face him in battle. They eventually clash during the middle of the senior dance at Buffy's high school. Through the use of her own unconventional methods, she is able to defeat Lothos and his minions.

==Canon status==
Many of the details given in the film differ from the [[Buffyverse canon|continuity]] of the later television series. For example, Buffy's history is dissimilar, and both the vampires' and [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]'s abilities are depicted differently. Joss Whedon has expressed his disapproval with the movie's interpretation of the script,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 Bronze VIP Archive - January 17, 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; stating, &quot;I finally sat down and had written it and somebody had made it into a movie, and I felt like &amp;mdash; well, that's not quite her. It's a start, but it's not quite the girl.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ervin-Gore, Shawna, &quot;[http://www.darkhorse.com/news/interviews.php?id=737 Dark Horse; Joss Whedon]&quot; ''darkhorse.com'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Official Buffy Watcher's Guide'', Whedon wrote the pilot to the TV series as a sequel to his ''original'' script, which is why the show makes references to things that didn't happen in the movie. In 1999 [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a graphic novel adaptation of Whedon's original script under the title, ''[[The Origin (Buffy comic)|The Origin]]''. Whedon stated: &quot;The ''Origin'' comic, though I have issues with it, CAN pretty much be accepted as canonical. They did a cool job of combining the movie script with the series, that was nice, and using the series Merrick and  not a certain OTHER thespian who shall remain hated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 |title=Bronze VIP Archive - January 17, 1999 |publisher=Cise.ufl.edu |date=1999-01-17 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
The movie debuted at number 5 at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office `Honors' Tops in a Lackluster Bunch|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-10/entertainment/ca-56005_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remake==
On May 25, 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that [[Roy Lee]] and Doug Davison of Vertigo Entertainment were working with Fran Rubel Kuzui and Kaz Kuzui on a re-envisioning or relaunch of the ''Buffy'' movie for the big screen. The movie would not be a [[sequel]] or [[prequel]] to the existing film or television franchise and [[Joss Whedon]] would have no involvement in the project. None of the characters, cast, or crew from the television series would be featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kit |first=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i666afabc28491e6a2f12dfb80c0f7098 |title='Buffy' in for feature relaunch |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2009-05-25 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television series executive producer [[Marti Noxon]] later reflected that this story might have been produced by the studio in order to frighten Whedon into taking the reins of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b19604_exclusive_marti_noxon_on_future_of_buffy.html|title=Exclusive: Marti Noxon on the Future of 'Buffy'|accessdate=2010-07-24|date=2010-07-21|work=[[Fearnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 2010, [[Hollywood Reporter]] confirmed that Warner Bros. has picked up the movie rights to the remake.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/buffy-remake-finds-home-warner-48105,&lt;/ref&gt; The film is set for release sometime in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=71841|title=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, it was announced ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' actress [[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]] is in talks for the [[Buffy Summers|lead role]] in the upcoming movie. However, [[Whit Anderson]], screenwriter on the movie, indicated that casting hadn't begun. When asked about the rumor during the launch of her endorsement of FLIRT! cosmetics, Morris told Access Hollywood that she was aware of the rumored Buffy role consideration and was excited about it. Though she did not categorically confirm that she was approached to do the reboot, Morris is not opposed to the idea provided that production would not interfere with her ''Glee'' duties. ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' cast member [[Candice Accola]] also expressed interest, according to an [[E! Online]] interview. As a fan of the original movie, Accola said she never watched the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|show]], but thinks that the ''Buffy'' film is a &quot;fun girl-power thing&quot;.

20th Century Fox, who usually holds rights to the more successful ''Buffy''/''Angel'' television franchise, will retain merchandising and some distribution rights.

'''Barter''' is a method of exchange by which [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a [[medium of exchange]], such as [[money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= O'Sullivan |first= Arthur |coauthors= Steven M. Sheffrin |title= Economics: Principles in Action |publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |page=243 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually [[wiktionary:bilateral|bilateral]], but may be [[multilateral]], and usually exists parallel to monetary systems in most developed countries, though to a very limited extent. Barter usually replaces money as the method of exchange in times of monetary crisis, such as when the [[currency]] may be either unstable (e.g., [[hyperinflation]] or [[Deflation#Deflationary_spiral|deflationary spiral]]) or simply unavailable for conducting commerce.

==History==
[[File:Barter-Chickens for Subscription.jpg|left|thumb|250px|An 1874 newspaper illustration from [[Harper's Weekly]], showing a man engaging in barter: offering chickens in exchange for his yearly newspaper subscription.]]

Contrary to popular conception, there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. 'The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.' pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of [[gift economics]]. When barter did in fact occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or would-be enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David. 'Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value'. pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

While one-to-one bartering is practised between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made. Compared to one-to-one bartering, concerns over unequal exchanges are reduced in a barter exchange.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Modern [[trade]] and barter has developed into a sophisticated tool that can sometimes help businesses increase their efficiencies by monetizing their unused capacities and excess inventories.  The worldwide organized barter exchange and trade industry has grown to an $8 billion a year industry and is used by thousands of businesses and individuals. The advent of the Internet and sophisticated relational database software programs has made it easier to conduct these activities and has further advanced the barter industry's growth. Organized barter has grown globally to the point where virtually every country now has a formalized barter and trade network of some kind. Complex business models based on the concept of barter are today possible since the advent of [[Web 2.0]] technologies. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Bartering benefits [[company|companies]] and countries that see a mutual benefit in exchanging goods and services rather than [[cash]], and it also enables those who are lacking hard currency to obtain goods and services. To make up for a lack of hard currency, [[Thailand]]'s [[township]], [[Amphoe Kut Chum]], once issued its own local [[scrip]] called ''Bia Kut Chum'':  [[Thai baht|Bia]] is [[Thai language|Thai]] for [[cowry]] shell, was once {{Frac|6400}} Baht, and is still current in metaphorical expressions. Running afoul of national currency laws, the community changed to barter [[coupon]]s called ''[[Merit (Buddhism)|Boon]]'' Kut Chum that bear a fixed value in baht, which they swap for goods and services within the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angkor.com/2bangkok/2bangkok/forum/archive/index.php/t-2224.html A Boon to Kut Chum archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade exchanges==
A trade or barter exchange is a commercial organization that provides a trading platform and bookkeeping system for its members or clients. The member companies buy and sell products and services to each other using an internal currency known as barter or trade dollars. Modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits – they are not obligated to purchase from who they sold to, and vice-versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

It is estimated that over 350,000 businesses in the United States are involved in barter exchange activities. There are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange. Several major cities in the U.S. and Canada do not currently have a local barter exchange. There are two industry groups, the [http://www.nate.org National Association of Trade Exchanges] (NATE) and the [http://www.irta.com International Reciprocal Trade Association] (IRTA). Both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members. Moreover, each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade. NATE's currency is the known as the BANC and IRTA's currency is called Universal Currency (UC).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The first exchange system was the Swiss [[WIR Bank]]. It was founded in 1934 as a result of currency shortages after the stock market crash of 1929. &quot;WIR&quot; is both an abbreviation of Wirtschaftsring and the word for &quot;we&quot; in German, reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Corporate barter==
[[Corporation|Corporate]] barter focuses on larger transactions, which is different from a traditional, retail oriented barter exchange.  Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a &quot;trade-credit&quot;.  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed, but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the &quot;client&quot; bought it themselves. (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Internet bartering==
Swapping is the increasingly prevalent informal bartering system in which participants in [[Internet communities]] trade items of comparable value on a trust basis using the [[Internet]]. The most notable disadvantage to electronic barter is inherent in [[Internet commerce]], that of trust. How can consumers have confidence that they will receive what they bargained, or paid, for? Although the Internet based consumer market has by its continued existence and growth demonstrated that it works, there is never a guarantee of satisfaction in consumer to consumer transactions. There is no absolute defense against fraud. However, it can be argued that when a person barters there is less incentive to deliberately mislead. Neither party is paid; each party receives something that would only then have to be converted to cash. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Barter markets==
In Spain (particularly the Catalonia region) there is a growing number of exchange markets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These barter markets or swap meets work without money. Participants bring things they do not need and exchange them for the unwanted goods of another participant. Swapping among three parties often helps satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/barcelonas-barter-markets-an-antidote-to-overconsumption/ Barcelona's barter markets] (from faircompanies.com. Accessed 2009-06-29.)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Reciprocal Trade Association]], the industry trade body, more than 400,000 businesses transacted $10 billion globally in 2008 — and officials expect trade volume to grow by 15% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1931665,00.html?xid=rss-topstories TIMES], nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental implications==
Barter complements the [[environmental movement]] that has gained traction in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The expenditure of resources involved in the manufacture and distribution of new products is concomitantly reduced by trading existing products. A global market for barter mitigates waste and acts as a counterpoint to the disposable economy. Consumer and small business websites such as [[BarterQuest.com]] promote bartering as a green alternative to buying and selling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP13vZ91P7k&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax implications==
In the United States, the sales a barter exchange makes are considered taxable revenue by the [[IRS]] and the gross amount of a barter exchange member's sales are reported to the IRS by the barter exchange via a 1099-B form.  The requirement for barter exchanges to report members sales was enacted in the Tax Equity &amp; Fair Responsibility Act of 1982.  According to the IRS, &quot;The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the [[income]] of both parties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 420 Bartering Income|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense.  Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Limitations of a barter economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
Need for presence of double coincidence of wants''': For barter to occur between two people, both would need to have what the other wants.

*'''Absence of common measure of value''': In a monetary economy, money plays the role of a measure of value of all goods, so their values can be measured against each other; this role may be absent in a barter economy.

*'''Indivisibility of certain goods''': If a person wants to buy a certain amount of another's goods, but only has for payment one indivisible unit of another good which is worth more than what the person wants to obtain, a barter transaction cannot occur.

*'''Lack of standards for deferred payments''': This is related to the absence of a common measure of value, although if the debt is denominated in units of the good that will eventually be used in payment, it is not a problem.

*'''Difficulty in storing wealth''': If a society relies exclusively on perishable goods, storing wealth for the future may be impractical.  However, some barter economies rely on durable goods like pigs or cattle for this purpose.

'''Berthe Morisot''' (January 14, 1841&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; March 2, 1895) was a [[Painting|painter]] and a member of the circle of painters in [[Paris]] who became known as the [[Impressionists]]. 

In 1864, she exhibited for the first time in the highly esteemed [[Paris Salon|Salon de Paris]]. Sponsored by the government, and judged by [[academician]]s, the Salon was the official, annual [[art exhibition|exhibition]] of the [[Académie des beaux-arts]] in Paris. Her work was selected for exhibition in six subsequent Salons&lt;ref&gt;Denvir, 2000, pp. 29-79.&lt;/ref&gt; until, in 1874, she joined the ''&quot;rejected&quot;'' Impressionists in the first of their own exhibitions, which included [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]],  [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Alfred Sisley]]. It was held at the [[studio]] of the [[photographer]] [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]. 

She became the sister-in-law of her friend and colleague, [[Édouard Manet]], when she married his brother, Eugène.

==Education==
[[Image:Berthe Morisot, Le berceau (The Cradle), 1872.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Berthe Morisot, ''The Cradle,'' 1872, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Morisot was born in [[Bourges]], [[Cher (département)|Cher]], [[France]] into a successful bourgeois family. Both she and her sister, [[Edma Morisot]], chose to become painters. Once Berthe Morisot settled on pursuing art, her family did not impede her career.

She was born into a family that, according to family tradition, had included one of the most prolific [[Rococo]] painters of the [[ancien régime]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]],&lt;ref&gt;Higonnet, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; whose handling of color and expressive, confident brushwork influenced later painters. By age twenty, she had met and befriended the important, and pivotal, landscape painter of the [[Barbizon School]], [[Camille Corot]], who excelled in figure painting as well. 

The older artist instructed Berthe and her sister in painting and introduced them to other artists and teachers. Under Corot's influence, Morisot took up the [[plein air]] method of working. As art students, Berthe and Edma worked closely together until Edma married, had children, and no longer had time to paint so intensely as Berthe. Letters between them show a loving and cordial relationship, underscored by Berthe's regret at the distance between them and about Edma's withdrawal from painting. Edma wholeheartedly supported Berthe's continued work and the families of the two sisters always remained close.

==Manet and impressionism==
[[Image:Berthe Morisot 005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Berthe Morisot, ''Grain field'', [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Morisot's first appearance in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon de Paris]] came at the age of twenty-three in 1864, with the acceptance of two [[landscape art|landscape]] paintings. She continued to show regularly in the Salon, to generally favorable reviews, until 1873, the year before the first Impressionist exhibition. 

[[Image:L'enfant au Tablier Rouge.jpg|thumb|Berthe Morisot, ''L'Enfant au Tablier Rouge,'' a sketch]]
Meanwhile, in 1868 Morisot became acquainted with [[Édouard Manet]]. He took a special interest in Morisot, as is evident from his warm portrayal of her in several paintings, including a striking portrait study of Morisot in a black veil, while in mourning for her father's death (displayed at the top of the article). Correspondence between them bespeaks affection. He once gave her an [[easel]] as a [[Christmas]] present. He also interfered in one of her Salon submissions when he was engaged to transport it. Manet mistook one of Morisot's self-criticisms as an invitation to add his corrections, which he did, much to Morisot's dismay. 

Although traditionally Manet has been related as the master and Morisot as the follower, there is evidence that their relationship was a reciprocating one.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 2000, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Morisot had developed her own distinctive artistic style. Records of paintings show Manet's approval and appreciation of certain stylistic and compositional decisions that Morisot originated. He incorporated some of these characteristics into his own work. 

[[Image:Berthe Morisot Kind zwischen Stockrosen.jpg|left|thumb|Berthe Morisot, ''Child among Staked Roses'' (common mistranslation of ''Child among Hollyhocks''), 1881, [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]], [[Cologne]]]] It was Morisot who persuaded Manet to attempt [[plein air]] painting, which she had been practicing since having been introduced to it by Corot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulvanrensburg.com/morisot.html | title = Berthe Morisot (1841-1895)|publisher=Paul van Rensburg Gallery of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also drew Manet into the circle of painters who soon became known as the Impressionists. In 1874, Morisot married Manet's brother, Eugene, and they had one daughter, Julie. [[Julie Manet]] became the subject for many of her mother's paintings and a book of her memoirs ''Growing Up with the Impressionists: The Diary of Julie Manet,'' was published in 1987. 

As a doctrinaire Impressionist as well as a member of the ''haute bourgeoisie'', Morisot painted what she experienced on a daily basis. Her paintings reflect the 19th century cultural restrictions of her class and gender.  She avoided urban and street scenes as well as the nude figure and, like her fellow female Impressionist Mary Cassatt, focused on domestic life and portraits in which she could use family and personal friends as models.  Paintings like ''The Cradle'' (1872), in which she depicted current trends for nursery furniture, reflect her sensitivity to fashion and advertising, both of which would have been apparent to her female audience.  

Her works include not only landscapes, portraits, garden settings and boating scenes, but also subjects portraying the comfort and intimacy of family and domestic life, as did her colleagues, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Mary Cassatt]].

Berthe Morisot died of [[pneumonia]] contracted while attending to her daughter Julie's similar illness on March 2, 1895 in Paris and was interred in the [[Cimetière de Passy]].

'''Barnard College''' is a private [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]], an official college of [[Columbia University]], and a member of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]]. Founded in 1889, Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900. The College is known for its distinctive academic culture and low student-to-faculty ratio of 9-to-1. The {{Convert|4|acre|adj=on|lk=on}} campus stretches along [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] between 116th and 120th Streets in the [[Morningside Heights, New York City|Morningside Heights]] neighborhood in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]], in [[New York City]]. It is adjacent to Columbia's campus and near [[Academic Acropolis|several other academic institutions]] and has been used by Barnard since 1898. 

==History==
[[Image:Barnard College, NYC IMG 0961.JPG|right|thumb|Barnard Hall]]
Barnard was founded to provide an [[Female education|education for women]] comparable to that of Columbia and other [[Ivy League]] schools, most of which admitted only men for undergraduate study into the 1960s. The college was named after [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]], an American educator and mathematician, who served as the president of the then-[[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] from 1864 to 1889. Frederick Barnard advocated equal educational privileges for men and women, preferably in a coeducational setting. The school's founding, however, is largely due to the efforts of [[Annie Nathan Meyer]], a student and writer who was not satisfied with Columbia's effort to educate women.

Barnard's original 1889 home was a rented [[brownstone]] at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 &quot;specials&quot;, who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science. When Columbia University announced in 1892 its impending move to Morningside Heights, Barnard built a new campus on 119th-120th Streets with gifts from Mary E. Brinckerhoff, [[Elizabeth Milbank Anderson]] and Martha T. Fiske. [[Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls]], built in 1897-1898, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the college grew it needed additional space, and in 1903 it received the three blocks south of 119th Street from Anderson who had purchased a former portion of the Bloomingdale Asylum site from the New York Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Plimpton Papers, Barnard College Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Students' Hall]], now known as Barnard Hall, was built in 1916. [[Brooks and Hewitt Halls]] were built in 1906-1907 and 1926–1927, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv_ny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10059|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Brooks and Hewitt Halls|date=June 2003|accessdate=2011-03-19 |author=Kathleen A. Howe|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

==Relationship with Columbia University==
Barnard College is an official college of Columbia University,{{r|catalog}} and all Barnard faculty are granted tenure by the college and Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;bctenure&quot;&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/docs/tenframe.html Principles and Customs Governing the Procedures of Ad Hoc Committees and University-Wide Tenure Review]. Retrieved November 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The university awards its degrees, which are signed by both the Barnard and Columbia presidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;bccupartnership&quot;/&gt; In 1900, Barnard formalized an affiliation with the university which made available to its students the instruction and facilities of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;catalog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnard.edu/catalogue/college |title=Barnard College Course Catalogue |publisher=Barnard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard currently pays an annual fee to the university to use Columbia facilities. The affiliation continues although [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], the university's original undergraduate school, began admitting women in 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard for a [[merger]] akin to the one between [[Harvard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955006,00.html Education: Columbia Decides to Go Coed]&quot; ''Time'', 1 February 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the affiliation Barnard is legally and financially separate from Columbia, with an independent faculty and board of trustees. It is responsible for its own separate admissions, health, security, guidance and placement services, and has its own alumnae association. Nonetheless, Barnard students participate in the academic, social, athletic and extracurricular life of the broader University community on a reciprocal basis, and several of the university's undergraduate departments are based in the college. Most Columbia classes are open to Barnard students and vice versa, Barnard students and faculty are represented in the University Senate, and student clubs such as the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' are open to all students.&lt;ref name=&quot;bccupartnership&quot;&gt;[http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/about/columbia-partnership Partnership with Columbia]. Retrieved 2011-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
[[Image:BarnardMilbank01.jpg|thumb|right|thumb|A view of Milbank Hall, Barnard College]]
Admissions to Barnard College is considered most selective by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/2708|accessdate=2008-09-23|title=America's Best Colleges 2008: Barnard College: At a glance|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard College is the most selective women's college in the nation;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alix Pianin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Alix Pianin|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/04/05/barnard-admissions-rate-drops-265-percent|title=Barnard admissions rate drops to 26.5 percent|work=[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]|date=April 5, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, Barnard had the lowest acceptance rate of the five [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] that remain single-sex in admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/2708 |title=Rankingsandreviews.com |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/3237 |title=Rankingsandreviews.com |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/2209 |title=Rankingsandreviews.com |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the class of 2011, Barnard College admitted 28.7% of those who applied. The median [[ACT (test)|ACT]] score was 30, while the median combined [[SAT]] score was 2100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnard Admissions&quot;&gt;[http://www.barnard.edu/admiss/applying/profile.html Barnard Admissions]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the class of 2012, the admission &lt;!-- their web site calls it an &quot;admit rate,&quot;--&gt; rate was 28.5% of the 4,273 applications received. The early-decision admission rate was 47.7%, out of 392 applications. The median SAT Combined was 2060, with median subscores of 660 in Math, 690 in Critical Reading, and 700 in Writing. The Median ACT score was 30. Of the women in the class of 2012, 89.4% ranked in first or second decile at their high school (of the 41.3% ranked by their schools). The average [[Grade (education)|GPA]] of the class of 2012 was 94.3 on a 100-point scale and 3.88 on a 4.0 scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnard Admissions&quot;/&gt;

===Academic Ranking===
{{details|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}

Barnard was most recently ranked 26th in the U.S. News &amp; World Report Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/?q=article/2010/09/30/number-theory |title=Number Theory |publisher=columbiaspectator.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranking came under widespread criticism, as it only accounted for institution-specific resources. Greg Brown, chief operating officer at Barnard, said, “I believe that our ranking is lower than it should be, primarily because the methodology simply can’t account for the Barnard-Columbia relationship. Because the Columbia relationship doesn’t fit neatly into any of the survey categories, it is essentially ignored. Rankings are inherently limited in this way.” 

In 1998, then president [[Judith Shapiro]] compared the ranking service to the &quot;equivalent of Sport's Illustrated's swimsuit issue.&quot; According to Shapiro's letter, &quot;Such a ranking system certainly does more harm than good in terms of educating the public.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnard.edu/president/usnews.html|title=US News|publisher=bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, June 19, 2007, following a meeting of the [[Annapolis Group]], which represents over 100 liberal arts colleges, Barnard announced that it would no longer participate in the U.S. News annual survey, and that they would fashion their own way to collect and report common data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Marty | last =Kaplan | title =Reaming College Rankings| publisher = [[Huffington Post]] | date = 20 June 2007 | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marty-kaplan/reaming-college-rankings_b_52995.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barnard Library==
Barnard's Wollman Library is located in Adele Lehman Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnard.edu/library/lehmanhall.html |title=BLAIS &amp;#124; Library |publisher=Barnard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection includes over 300,000 volumes which support the undergraduate curriculum. It also houses an archival collection of official and student publications, photographs, letters and other material that documents Barnard’s history from its founding in 1889 to the present day. Barnard's rare books collections include the Overbury Collection, the personal library of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] prize-winning poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], and a small collection of other rare books. The Overbury Collection consists of 3,300 items, including special and first edition books as well as manuscript materials by and about American women authors. Alumnae Books is a collection of books donated by Barnard alumnae authors. Conflicting accounts list either Richard B. Snow or Philip M. Chu as the architect of Lehman Hall... as well as of the [[Amherst College]] library and one of the libraries at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/books/review/Thomas-t.html?pagewanted=2 |title=Thomas, E., &quot;The War Beneath the Sea&quot; |publisher=''The New York Times'' Sunday Book Review, May 6, 2010 | date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/04/us/philip-chu-83-architect-dies-left-legacy-of-college-libraries.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Philip Chu, 83, Architect, Dies; Left Legacy of College Libraries |publisher=''The New York Times'' U.S., November 4, 2003 | first=Eric | last=Pace | date=November 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building opened in 1959.

===Barnard Library Zine Collection===
Barnard collects [[zine]]s in an effort to document the [[third-wave feminism]] and [[Riot Grrrl]] culture. The Zine Collection complements Barnard's [[women's studies]] research holdings because it gives room to voices of girls and women otherwise under or not at all represented in the book stacks. According to its [[Library collection development]] policy, Barnard's zines are &quot;written by New York City and other urban women with an emphasis on zines by women of color. (In this case the word ''woman'' includes anyone who identifies as female and some who don't believe in [[Gender binary|binary gender]].) The zines are personal and political publications on [[activism]], [[anarchism]], [[body image]], third wave feminism, [[gender]], [[parenting]], [[Gay community|queer community]], riotgrrrl, [[sexual assault]], and other topics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/library/zines/index.htm Barnard Library Zine Collection]. Retrieved June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard's collection documents movements and trends in [[Feminism|feminist]] thought through the personal work of artists, writers, and activists. Currently, the Barnard Zine Collection has over 2,000 items, including zines about [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], gender, [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[childbirth]], [[mother]]hood, [[politics]], and [[Intimate relationship|relationships]]. Barnard attempts to collect two copies of each zine, one of which circulates with the second copy archived for [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]]. To facilitate [[library circulation|circulation]], Barnard zines are [[Library catalog|cataloged]] in CLIO (the Columbia/Barnard [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]]) and [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]]'s [[WorldCat|Worldcat]].

==Culture and student life==
===Student organizations===
[[Image:Barnard College Greek Games statue IMG 0972.JPG|right|thumb|Barnard College Greek Games statue]]
Every Barnard student is part of the [[Students' union|Student Government Association]] (SGA), which elects a representative [[Student governments in the United States|student government]]. Students serve with faculty and administrators on college committees and help to shape policy in a wide variety of areas.

Student groups include [[theatre]] and vocal music groups, language clubs, [[literary magazines]], a biweekly magazine called the ''Barnard Bulletin'', community service groups, and others. Barnard students can also join [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] or organizations at Columbia University, while Columbia University students are allowed in most, but not all, Barnard organizations.

Barnard's McIntosh Activities Council (commonly known as McAC), named after the first President of Barnard, Millicent Mcintosh, organizes various community focused events on campus, such as Big Sub and [[Midnight breakfast|Midnight Breakfast]]. McAC is made up of five sub-committees which are the Multi-Cultural committee, the Time-Out committee, the Network committee, the Community committee, and the Action committee. Each committee has a different focus, such as hosting and publicizing multi-cultural events (Multi-Cultural), having regular study breaks and relaxation events (Time-Out), giving students opportunities to be involved with Alumnae and various professionals (Network), planning events that bring the entire student body together (Community), and planning community service events that give back to the surrounding community (Action).

In 2011, Barnard's SGA and McAC will work together to bring back the Greek Games, an old but quite famous Barnard tradition.

Two [[National Panhellenic Conference]] organizations were founded at Barnard College. [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] Fraternity, was founded on January 2, 1897, the [[Alpha Epsilon Phi]], founded on October 24, 1909, though both are no longer on campus. Barnard students now participate in four National Panhellenic Conference sororities - [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Sigma Delta Tau]].

===Traditions===
* Every April, Barnard and Columbia students participate in the [[Take Back the Night]] march and speak-out. This annual event grew out of a 1988 [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] conference. The march has grown from under 200 participants in 1988 to more than 2,500 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/tbtn/ |title=Take Back the Night |publisher=Columbia.edu |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Midnight breakfast|Midnight Breakfast]] marks the beginning of finals week. As a highly popular event and long-standing college tradition, Midnight Breakfast is hosted by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council). In addition to providing standard breakfast foods, each year's theme is also incorporated into the menu. Past themes have included &quot;I YUMM the 90s,&quot; &quot;Grease,&quot; and &quot;Take me out to the ballgame.&quot; The event is a school-wide affair as college deans, trustees and the President, [[Debora Spar]], serve food to about a thousand students. It takes place the night before finals begin every semester.
*On Spirit Day, there is a large barbecue, the deans serve [[ice cream]] to students, different activities are hosted, and the whole student body celebrates. The school sells &quot;I Love BC&quot; T-shirts, and gives out free Barnard products. The event is run by the Spirit Day Planning Committee which is chaired by the Programming Officer of the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council) and the Representative for Community Affairs of the Student Government Association (SGA).
*During the fall semester, students help to construct and then [[Eating|consume]] a [[mile]]-long [[sandwich]] known as &quot;The big sub&quot;. Every year another foot is added onto the sub as it stretches across campus. The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).
*In the spring of each year, Barnard holds the Night Carnival, in which many of Barnard's student groups set up tables with games and prizes. The event is organized by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council).

===Athletics===
Barnard athletes compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] Division I and the [[Ivy League]] through the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium. There are 15 [[College athletics|intercollegiate teams]], and students also compete at the [[Intramural sports|intramural]] and club levels.
From 1975-1983, before the establishment of the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, Barnard students competed as the &quot;Barnard Bears&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/barnard/docs/magazine-spring09/6 |title=magazine-spring09/6 |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1975, students referred to themselves as the &quot;Barnard honeybears&quot;.

==Sustainability==
Barnard College has issued a statement affirming its commitment to [[Sustainability|environmental sustainability]], a major part of which is the goal of reducing its [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by 30% by 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainability At Barnard&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Sustainability At Barnard| publisher =Barnard College| url =http://www.barnard.edu/green/index.html| accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainability - Barnard Growing Greener&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Sustainability - Barnard Growing Greener| publisher =Barnard College| url =http://www.barnard.edu/green/planyc.html| accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Student EcoReps work as a resource on environmental issues for students in Barnard's residence halls, while the student-run Earth Coalition works on outreach initiatives such as local park clean-ups, tutoring elementary school students in environmental education, and sponsoring environmental forums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groups and Organizations - The Earth Institute at Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Groups and Organizations - The Earth Institute at Columbia| publisher =Columbia University| url =http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/31| accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard earned a &quot;C-&quot; for its sustainability efforts on the [[Campus Carbon Neutrality#Sustainable Endowments Institute &amp; the College Sustainability Report Card|College Sustainability Report Card]] 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Its highest marks were in Student Involvement and Food and Recycling, receiving a &quot;B&quot; in both categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2009/schools/barnard-college |title=Greenreportcard.org |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine Ways of Knowing==
Nine Ways of Knowing are liberal arts requirements. Students must take one year of one laboratory science, study a single foreign language for four semesters, and complete one 3-credit course in each of the following categories: reason and value, social analysis, historical studies, cultures in comparison, quantitative and deductive reasoning, literature, and visual and performing arts. The use of AP or IB credit to fulfill these requirements is very limited, but Nine Ways of Knowing courses may overlap with major or minor requirements. In addition to the Nine Ways of Knowing, students must complete a first-year seminar, a first-year English course, and two semesters of physical education.

==Controversies==
In the spring of 1960 Columbia University President Grayson Kirk complained to the President of Barnard that Barnard students were wearing inappropriate clothing. The garments in question were pants and Bermuda shorts. The administration forced the Student Council to institute a dress code. Students would be allowed to wear shorts and pants only at Barnard and only if the shorts were no more than two inches above the knee and the pants were not tight. Barnard women crossing the street to enter the Columbia campus wearing shorts or pants were required to cover themselves with a long coat similar to a [[jilbab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Ban on Shorts Threatens Classic Barnard Couture |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A15F73F5916738DDDA10A94DC405B808AF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22Ban%20on%20Shorts%20Threatens%20Classic%20Barnard%20Couture%22&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times |page=1 |date=April 28, 1960 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Barnard College Blue Book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=87–88|chapter=Administrative Regulations: Campus Etiquette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article on students who cohabited, identifying one of the persons they interviewed as a student at Barnard College from New Hampshire named &quot;Susan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

She was called before Barnard's student-faculty administration judicial committee, where she faced the possibility of expulsion. A student protest included a petition signed by 300 other Barnard women, admitting that they too had broken the regulations against cohabitating. The judicial committee reached a compromise and the student was allowed to remain in school, but was denied use of the college cafeteria and barred from all social activities. The student briefly became a focus of intense national attention. She eventually dropped out of Barnard.&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', April 8, 1968, p. 85 and ''Newsweek'', April 29, 1968, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Order of Saint Benedict''' ([[Latin]] name: ''Ordo Sancti Benedicti'') is a [[Roman Catholic religious order]] of independent [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] [[Cenobium|communities]] that observe the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]. Within the order, each individual community (which may be a [[monastery]], a [[priory]] or [[abbey]]) maintains its own autonomy, while the organization as a whole exists to represent their mutual interests. Today the terms &quot;'''Order of St Benedict'''&quot; and &quot;Benedictine Order&quot; are also used frequently to refer to the total of the independent [[Benedictine]] abbeys, thereby giving the wrong impression of a &quot;generalate&quot; or &quot;motherhouse&quot; with jurisdiction over dependent communities. The [[Benedictine Confederation]], which was established in [[1883]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his brief ''Summum semper'', is the international governing body of the order, headed by the Abbot Primate.

==Historical development==
[[File:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|right|St Benedict of Nursia (c. 480-543), detail from a [[fresco]] by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Saint Mark's Basilica|San Marco]], [[Florence]] (c. [[1400]]-[[1455]]).]]
The monastery at [[Monte Cassino]] established in [[Italy]] by [[St. Benedict of Nursia]] circa 529 was the first of a dozen monasteries founded by him. Even so, there is no evidence to suggest that he intended to found an order. To the contrary, the Rule of St Benedict presupposes the autonomy of each community. Despite the absence of a Benedictine order, since most monasteries founded during the Middle Ages adopted the Rule of St Benedict, it became the standard for Western Monasticism.

The Benedictine monasteries went on to make considerable contributions not only to the monastic and the spiritual life of the West, but also to economics, education, and government, so that the years from 550 to 1150 may be called the &quot;Benedictine centuries&quot;.

Even today Benedictine monasticism is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders insofar as its individual communities are not part of a religious order with &quot;Generalates&quot; and &quot;Superiors General&quot;. Rather, in modern times, the various [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] houses have formed themselves loosely into congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines) that in turn are represented in the [[Benedictine Confederation]] that came into existence through [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Apostolic Brief &quot;Summum semper&quot; on July 12, 1883. This organization facilitates dialogue of Benedictine communities with each other and the relationship between Benedictine communities and other [[religious order]]s and the church at large.

The Rule of Saint Benedict is also used by a number of religious orders that began as reforms of the Benedictine tradition such as the  [[Cistercian]]s and [[Trappist]]s although none of these groups are part of the [[Benedictine Confederation]].

The largest number of Benedictines are Roman Catholics, but there are also some within the [[Anglican Communion]] and occasionally within other Christian denominations as well, for example, within the [[Lutheran Church]].

==Benedictine vow and life==
[[Image:BenedictineVespers.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Benedictine [[monk]]s singing [[Vespers]] on [[Holy Saturday]] in [[Morristown, NJ]]]]
The Rule of St Benedict (ch. 58.17) requires candidates for reception into a Benedictine community to promise solemnly ''stability'' (to remain in the same monastery), ''conversatio morum'' (an idiomatic Latin phrase suggesting &quot;conversion of manners&quot;), and ''obedience'' (to the superior, because the superior holds the place of Christ in their community). This solemn commitment tends to be referred to as the &quot;Benedictine vow&quot; and is the Benedictine antecedent and equivalent of the [[evangelical counsels]] professed by candidates for reception into a [[religious order]]. Much scholarship over the last 50 years has been dedicated to the translation of ''conversatio morum''.   The older translation &quot;conversion of life&quot; has generally been replaced with phrases such as &quot;a monastic manner of life&quot; drawing from the Vulgate's use of ''conversatio'' as the translation of &quot;citizenship&quot; in Philippians 3:22.  Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is better translated as one multi-part promise something like &quot;to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot.&quot;  

Benedictine [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es have full jurisdiction of their [[abbey]] and thus absolute authority over the [[Monk#Roman Catholicism|monks]] or [[nun]]s who are resident and have full authority, for example, to assign them duties, to decide which books they may or may not read, to take charge of their comings and goings, and if necessary to punish and even to [[excommunicate]] them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

A tight communal timetable ([[horarium]]) is meant to ensure that the time given by God is not wasted but in whichever way necessary used in his service, whether for prayer, work, meals, spiritual reading, sleep. 

The Benedictines make no vow of silence, nevertheless the hours of stricter silence are fixed, and even at other times, out of fraternal love, silence is maintained as much as is practically possible. Social conversations tend to be limited to communal recreation times. But such details, like many others details of the daily routine of a Benedictine house that the Rule of St Benedict leaves to the discretion of the superior, are set out in its customary.

In the Roman Catholic Church according to the norms of the [[Code of Canon Law]] 1983 a Benedictine abbey is a &quot;Religious Institute&quot;, and its professed members are therefore members of the &quot;Consecrated Life&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;Religious&quot;. Benedictine monks who have not been [[ordination|ordained]] and all nuns are members of the laity among the Christian faithful. Only those Benedictine monks who have been ordained as a [[deacon]] or [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] are also members of the [[clergy]] of the Roman Catholic Church. Benedictine [[Oblate (religion)|Oblates]] endeavor to embrace the spirit of the Benedictine vow in their own life in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=928|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church | url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p123a9p4.htm#III | accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-21280-4; p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Bayezid was born in [[Edirne]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and spent his youth in [[Bursa]], where he received a high-level education. His father [[Murad I]] named him governor of the province of [[Kütahya]].

Bayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father [[Murad I]], who was killed by Serbian nobleman [[Miloš Bojanic]] during (June 15), or immediately after (June 16), the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, by which  Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess Olivera Despina, the daughter of Prince [[Lazar of Serbia]], who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized [[Stefan Lazarević]], the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.

From 1389 to 1395 he conquered [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1394 he crossed the River [[Danube]] to attack [[Wallachia]], ruled at that time by [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]]. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on October 10, 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the [[Battle of Rovine]], on forested and swampy terrain, the [[Wallachians|Wallachian]]s won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid from conquering the country.

In 1394, Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]],&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril. ''The Oxford History of Byzantium''. 1st ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. p. 273-4&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Anadoluhisarı]] fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor [[John V Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the King of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (in 1410) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. Bayezid built the magnificent [[Bursa, Turkey#Mosques of Bursa|Ulu Camii]] in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.

Thus, the siege of [[Constantinople]] continued, lasting until 1401. The Emperor left the city to seek aid. The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] in the East.
[[Image:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stanisław Chlebowski]], ''Bayezid prisoned by Timur'', 1878]]
In 1400, the [[Central Asia]]n warlord [[Timur]] had succeeded in rousing the local Turkic [[bey]]liks that had been vassals of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] to join him in his attack on Bayezid. In the fateful [[Battle of Ankara]], on 20 July 1402, Bayezid was captured by Timur. His sons, however, escaped, and later they would start civil war  (see also [[Ottoman Interregnum]]). Some contemporary reports claimed that [[Timur]] kept Bayezid chained in a cage as a trophy. Likewise, there are many stories about Bayezid's captivity, including one that describes how [[Timur]] used him as a [[footstool]]. However, writers from Timur's court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death. One year later, Bayezid died &amp;mdash; some accounts claim that he committed suicide by smashing his head against the iron bars of his cage (the version given by Marlowe; see below). Other accounts claimed that he committed suicide by taking the poison concealed in his ring.

[[Image:I Bayezit.jpg|thumb|120px|Bayezid I.]]

==In fiction==
The defeat of Bayezid became a popular subject for later western writers, composers and painters. They revelled in the legend that he was taken by [[Timur]] to [[Samarkand]], and embellished it with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''Tamburlane the Great'' was first performed in [[London]] in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when [[William Harborne]] sailed for [[Constantinople]] as agent of the [[Levant Company]]. In 1648 there appeared the play ''Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet'' by [[Jean Magnon]], and in 1725 [[Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Tamerlano]]'' was first performed and published in London;&lt;ref&gt;London: Printed &amp; sold by J. Cluer, [1725]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivaldi|Vivaldi's]] version of the story, ''[[Bajazet (opera)|Bajazet]]'', was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of [[Trebizond]] ([[Trabzon]]) in a passionate and incredible love story. A cycle of paintings in [[Schloss Eggenberg]], near [[Graz]] in [[Austria]], translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the [[Habsburgs]] in central [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, C. (2006) ''The History of the Ottoman Empire: Osman's Dream''. New York: Basic Books; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayezid (spelt Bayazid) is a central character in the [[Robert E. Howard]] story ''Lord of Samarcand.''&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Robert E. (1973) ''Sowers of the Thunder,'' Ace Science Fiction&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bayezid II''' (December 3, 1447&amp;nbsp;– May 26, 1512) ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: بايزيد ثانى ''Bāyezīd-i &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ānī'', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''II.Bayezid'' or ''II.Beyazıt'') was the oldest son and successor of [[Mehmed II]], ruling as [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1481 to 1512. During his reign, Bayezid II consolidated the Ottoman Empire and thwarted a [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] rebellion soon before abdicating his throne to his son, [[Selim I]].

==Early life==
Bayezid II was born in [[Didymoteicho|Dimetoka]] Palace (now [[Didymoteicho]]) in [[Thrace]] as the son of [[Mehmed II]] (1451–81) and Valide Sultan [[Mükrime Hatun]], the daughter of Süleyman Bey, the sixth ruler of [[Dulkadir]] State, who died in 1492.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonds|first=Anna|title=Turkey's religious sites|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=2do8TIGfMKOcOISUsJsP&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=en&amp;id=xVbkAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Gülbahar+Albanian&amp;q=An+Albanian+by+birth,+legend+also+has+it+that+Gulbahar+Hatun+was+a+French+princess+kidnapped+for+the+sultan's+harem.#search_anchor|publisher=Damko|isbn=9758227009|page=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PPxC6rO7vvsC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Kladas+%2B+Albanian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TtY8TIrFJ4SoOKbF1Y8P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Albanian&amp;f=false|year=1992|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0691010781|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Turkish folk tales, she was a French princess kidnapped by Mehmed II. Bayezid II married [[Ayşe Hatun]], a convert of [[Greeks|Greek]] ethnicity, who was the mother of [[Selim I]].

==Fight for the throne==
Bayezid II's overriding concern was the quarrel with his brother [[Cem]], who claimed the throne and sought military backing from the Mamluks in Egypt.  Having been defeated by his brother's armies, Cem sought protection from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]] in [[Rhodes]].  Eventually, the Knights handed Cem over to [[Pope Innocent VIII]] (1484–1492).  The Pope thought of using Cem as a tool to drive the Turks out of Europe, but, as the Papal Crusade failed to come to fruition, Cem was left to languish and die in a Neapolitan prison.

==Reign==
Bayezid II ascended the Ottoman throne in 1481. Like his father, Bayezid II was a patron of western and eastern culture and unlike many other Sultans, worked hard to ensure a smooth running of domestic politics, which earned him the epithet of &quot;the Just&quot;.  Throughout his reign, Bayezid II engaged in numerous campaigns to conquer the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held despotate of [[Morea]], accurately defining this region as the key to future Ottoman naval power in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]]. The last of these wars ended in 1501 with Bayezid II in control of the main citadels of [[Mistra]] and [[Monemvasia]].  Bayezid is also responsible for certain self-inflicted intellectual wounds in Islamic civilization, such as the outlawing of all printing in Arabic and Turkic, a ban lasting in the Islamic world until 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Michael. ''The Last Crusade: Americanism and the Islamic Reformation'', Washington, D.C. (Potomac Books, 2007), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebellions in the east, such as that of the [[Qizilbash]], plagued much of Bayezid II's reign and were often backed by the [[Shah]] of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Ismail I|Ismail]], who was eager to promote [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ism]] to undermine the authority of the Ottoman state. Ottoman authority in [[Anatolia]] was indeed seriously threatened during this period, and at one point Bayezid II's grand [[vizier]], Ali Pasha, was killed in battle against rebels.

===Jewish and Muslim emigration===&lt;!--[[Moses_Capsali]] links here--&gt;
{{see|Nasrid-Ottoman relations}}
Bayezid II also sent out the Ottoman navy under the command of [[Kemal Reis]] to Spain in 1492 in order to save the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] who were expelled by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. He sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egger|first=Vernon O.|title=A History of the Muslim World Since 1260: The Making of a Global Community|accessdate=2009-04-13|year=2008|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0132269694|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. &quot;You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,&quot; he said to his courtiers&amp;nbsp;— &quot;he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JE 460&quot;&gt;''The Jewish encyclopedia: a descriptive record of the history, religion, literature, and customs of the Jewish people from the earliest times to the present day,'' Vol.2 Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler, Funk and Wagnalls, 1912 p.460&lt;/ref&gt; Bajazet addressed a [[firman (decree)|firman]] to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception.&lt;ref name=&quot;JE 460&quot;/&gt; He threatened with death all those who treated the Jews harshly or refused them admission into the empire. [[Moses Capsali]], who probably helped to arouse the sultan's friendship for the Jews, was most energetic in his assistance to the exiles. He made a tour of the communities, and was instrumental in imposing a tax upon the rich, to ransom the Jewish victims of the persecutions then prevalent.

The Arabs and Jews of Spain contributed much to the rising power of the Ottoman Empire by introducing new ideas, methods and craftsmanship. The first [[Gutenberg press|printing press]] in Constantinople was established by the Sephardic Jews in 1493. It is reported that under Bajazet's reign, Jews enjoyed a period of cultural flourishing, with the presence of such scholars as the [[Talmudist]] and scientist [[Mordecai Comtino]]; astronomer and poet [[Solomon ben Elijah Sharbit|Solomon ben Elijah Sharbiṭ ha-Zahab]]; [[Shabbethai]] ben Malkiel Cohen, and  the liturgical poet Menahem Tamar.

==Succession==
On September 14, 1509, [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt; was devastated by an earthquake. Bayezid II's final years saw a succession battle between his sons [[Selim I]] and [[Şehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]]. Ahmet, unexpectedly captured Karaman an Ottoman city and began marching to Constantinople to exploit his triumph. Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in [[Thrace]] but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee back to [[Crimea]]. Bayezid II developed fears that Ahmed might in turn kill him to gain the throne and refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople.

Selim returned from Crimea and, with support from the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], forced his father to adbicate throne on  April 25, 1512. Beyazit departed for retirement in his native Demotika, but he died on May 26, 1512 at [[Büyükçekmece]] before reaching his destination, and only a month after his abdication. He was buried next to the [[Bayezid Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]].

'''Boxing''', also called '''pugilism''', is a [[combat sport]] in which two people [[Combat|fight]] each other using their fists for competition. Boxing is typically supervised by a [[referee (boxing)|referee]] engaged in during a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds, and boxers generally of similar [[human weight|weight]]. There are four ways to win; if the opponent is knocked out and unable to get up before the referee counts to ten seconds (a [[knockout]], or KO) or if the opponent is deemed too [[injury|injured]] to continue (a [[Technical Knockout]], or TKO), if an opponent is disqualified for breaking a rule, or if there is no stoppage of the fight before an agreed number of rounds, a winner is determined either by the referee's decision or by judges' scorecards.

The tablet is believed to be 7,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownielocks.com/boxing.html Boxing Ancient History &amp; Cartoon Fun from Brownielocks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] (c. 1500–900 BC), and on [[Sardinia]], if we consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains (c. 2000–1000 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;EncyclopaediaBritannicaEntry&quot;/&gt;

=== Ancient Greek boxing ===

{{Main|Ancient Greek Boxing}}

[[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] (ca. 800 BC) contains the first detailed account of a boxing fight (Book XXIII).&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+23.624 Iliad, 23.655-696]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Iliad'', [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] warriors included boxing among their competitions honoring the fallen with great ceremonies (ca. 1200 BC), though it is possible that the Homeric epics reflect later culture. Another legend holds that the heroic ruler [[Theseus]], said to have lived around the 9th century BC, invented a form of boxing in which two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed.

Boxing was first accepted as an [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport in 688 BC, being called ''Pygme'' or ''Pygmachia''. Participants trained on [[punching bag]]s (called ''korykos''). Fighters wore leather straps (called ''himantes'') over their hands, wrists, and sometimes breast, to protect them from injury. The straps left their fingers free.

== Modern boxing ==
=== Broughton's rules (1743) ===

[[File:Blow2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A straight right demonstrated in [[Edmund Price]]'s ''The Science of Self Defense: A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling'', 1867]]
Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western [[Roman Empire]] when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in [[ancient Rus]] called [[Fistfight]]. As the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 18th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] sometimes referred to as '''prizefighting'''. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ''London Protestant Mercury'', and the first English bare-knuckle champion was [[James Figg]] in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibhof.com/figg.htm James B. Roberts and Alexander G. Skutt (1999). ''James Figg'', IBOHF]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the time when the word &quot;boxing&quot; first came to be used. It should be noted, that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fistfighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when [[Christopher Monck]], 2nd [[Duke of Albemarle]] (and later [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]]) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.

Early fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. The first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by heavyweight champion [[Jack Broughton]] in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743'']&lt;/ref&gt; Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton also invented and encouraged the use of &quot;mufflers&quot;, a form of padded gloves, which were used in training and exhibitions. The first paper on boxing was published in the late 18th century by successful [[Birmingham]] boxer 'William Futrell' who remained undefeated until his one hour and seventeen minute fight at Smitham Bottom, Croydon, on July 9, 1788 against a much younger &quot;Gentleman&quot; John Jackson which was attended by the [[Prince of Wales]]. 
[[File:Cribb vs Molineaux 1811.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Molineaux]] vs [[Tom Cribb]] in a re-match for the heavyweight championship of England, 1811]]
These rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers: They permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to begin a 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover.  However, this was considered &quot;unmanly&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (&quot;A Celebrated Pugilist&quot;), The Art and Practice of Boxing, 1825&lt;/ref&gt; and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Mendoza, The Modern Art of Boxing, 1790&lt;/ref&gt; Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, a certain amount of restraint was required when striking the head.

=== London Prize Ring rules (1838) ===
{{Main|London Prize Ring rules}}

In [[1838 in sports|1838]], the London Prize Ring rules were codified. Later revised in 1853, they stipulated the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/london-rules-1838.htm  Clay Moyle and Arly Allen (2006), ''1838 Prize Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fights occurred in a {{convert|24|ft}}-square ring surrounded by ropes.
* If a fighter was knocked down, he had to rise within 30 seconds under his own power to be allowed to continue.
* Biting, headbutting and hitting below the belt were declared fouls.

Through the late nineteenth century, boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police. Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics.

=== Marquess of Queensberry rules (1867) ===
In 1867, the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] were drafted by [[John Graham Chambers|John Chambers]] for amateur championships held at [[Lillie Bridge]] in London for [[Lightweight]]s, [[Middleweight]]s and [[Heavyweight]]s. The rules were published under the patronage of the [[John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], whose name has always been associated with them.

[[File:Leonard Cushing Kinetograph 1894.ogv|thumb|200px|left|The June 1894 Leonard–Cushing bout. Each of the six one-minute rounds recorded by the Kinetograph was made available to exhibitors for $22.50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/papr:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(edmp+4026))+@field(COLLID+edison)) Leonard–Cushing fight] Part of the Library of Congress ''Inventing Entertainment'' educational website. Retrieved 12/14/06.&lt;/ref&gt; Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard score a knockdown.]]
There were twelve rules in all, and they specified that fights should be &quot;a fair stand-up boxing match&quot; in a 24-foot-square or similar ring. Rounds were three minutes long with one minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down and wrestling was banned.

The introduction of gloves of &quot;fair-size&quot; also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9051067?tocId=9051067&amp;query=queensberry&amp;ct= Encyclopedia Britannica (2006). ''Queensbury Rules'', Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face. 

The English case of ''[[R v. Coney]]'' in 1882 found that a [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle]] fight was an [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]], despite the [[consensual crime|consent]] of the participants. This marked the end of widespread public bare-knuckle contests in England.

The first world heavyweight champion under the Queensberry Rules was [[James J. Corbett|&quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; Corbett]], who defeated [[John L. Sullivan]] in 1892 at the Pelican Athletic Club in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/corbett.htm Tracy Callis (2006). ''James Corbett'', Cyberboxingzone.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early twentieth century, boxers struggled to achieve legitimacy, aided by the influence of promoters like [[Tex Rickard]] and the popularity of great champions from John L. Sullivan to [[Jack Dempsey]]. Shortly after this era, boxing commissions and other sanctioning bodies were established to regulate the sport and establish universally recognized champions.

The ''[[Marquess of Queensberry rules]]'' have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.

A boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 12 rounds (formerly 15). A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls. Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches that connect, defense, knockdowns, and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one (Or both) fighters believe they have been &quot;robbed&quot; or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more &quot;seconds&quot; may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signaled end of each round.

A bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to &quot;go the distance&quot;. The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knockout; such bouts are said to have ended &quot;inside the distance&quot;. If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled &quot;knocked out&quot; (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by [[knockout]] (KO). A &quot;technical knockout&quot; (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a &quot;three-knockdown rule&quot;, in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A &quot;standing eight&quot; count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.

In general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, spitting or fondling the genitalia. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul or wallet slap. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the neck or head (called a &quot;rabbit-punch&quot;) or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between). If a &quot;clinch&quot; &amp;ndash; a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause &amp;ndash; is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to &quot;punch out&quot; of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.

Violations of these rules may be ruled &quot;fouls&quot; by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a &quot;no contest&quot; result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.

Unheard of these days, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a &quot;newspaper decision (NWS)&quot; might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A &quot;no decision&quot; bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a &quot;no decision&quot; bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only.  Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.

== Professional vs. amateur boxing ==
Throughout the 17th through 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters competed for [[prize money]], promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an [[Automated Boxing Scoring System]], which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.

=== Amateur boxing ===
:{{Main|Amateur boxing}}
[[File:Ouch-boxing-footwork.jpg|thumb|155px|[[Headgear (martial arts)|Headgear]] is mandatory in modern amateur boxing]]

Amateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the [[Olympic Games]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.

Competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip across the knuckle. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows ([[below the belt]]) is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm Andrew Eisele (2005). ''Olympic Boxing Rules'', About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as &quot;RSC&quot; (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).

=== Professional boxing ===
{{Main| Professional boxing}}
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:WilliamsvsKolle24.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A professional boxer punches his opponent via jabbing. Note the two boxers being bare-chested and without headgear.]] --&gt;
Professional bouts are usually much longer than amateur bouts, typically ranging from ten to twelve rounds, though four round fights are common for less experienced fighters or club fighters. There are also some two-&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=329616 BoxRec Boxing Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and three-round professional bouts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=521719 BoxRec Boxing Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in Australia. Through the early twentieth century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like [[Jack Dempsey]]. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the twentieth century until the early 1980s, when the death of boxer [[Duk Koo Kim]] reduced the limit to twelve.

Headgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more punishment before a fight is halted. At any time, however, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare chested.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). &quot;Boxing&quot;, World Book Online Americas Edition [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Owingsmillsboxingclub.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boxing styles ==

=== Definition of Style ===
&quot;Style&quot; is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters styles are alike, as it is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes.

=== Boxer/Out-fighter ===
[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]]]]
A classic &quot;boxer&quot; or stylist (also known as an &quot;out-fighter&quot;) seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Out-fighters need reach, hand speed, reflexes, and footwork.

Notable out-fighters include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Gene Tunney]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ezzard Charles]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.254&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willie Pep]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.384&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meldrick Taylor]], [[Larry Holmes]], [[Roy Jones Jr.]], [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Oscar de la Hoya]], [[Floyd Mayweather]], and [[Nonito Donaire]].

=== Boxer-puncher === 
[[File:Sugar Ray Robinson 1965 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Sugar Ray Robinson]] prompted sportswriters to create &quot;[[pound for pound]]&quot; rankings]]
A boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}), but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.

Notable punchers include [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Sam Langford]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Armstrong]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, Joe Frazier, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Louis]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.337&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sugar Ray Robinson]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Zale]], [[Archie Moore]], [[Carlos Monzón]]&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.353,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis Argüello]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Julio César Chávez]], [[Oscar de la Hoya]], [[Wladimir Klitschko]], [[Terry Norris]] [[Marco Antonio Barrera]] and [[Thomas Hearns]].

=== Brawler/slugger ===
A brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Mainly [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Irish-American]], [[Mexican people|Mexican]], and [[Mexican-American]] boxers popularized this style. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favour of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. A brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing) an example of this style would be [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Ray Mancini]], [[George Foreman]], [[Sonny Liston]], [[Arturo Gatti]], &quot;Irish&quot; [[Micky Ward]], [[Michael Katsidis]], and Ireland's [[John Duddy]].

=== Swarmers/in-fighter ===
In-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called &quot;pressure fighters&quot;) attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]] and uppercuts. A successful in-fighter often needs a good &quot;[[chin (boxing)|chin]]&quot; because swarming usually involves being hit with many [[jab]]s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting. The essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters utilize their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter.  A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts where they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; [[Mike Tyson]] was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. [[Julio César Chávez]] was known for his hard &quot;[[chin (boxing)|chin]]&quot;, punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson,  have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.

Notable in-fighters include [[Laszlo Papp]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Harry Greb]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts, Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.98, 99&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Dempsey]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rocky Marciano]],&lt;ref&gt;James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.339, 340&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Frazier]], [[Jake LaMotta]], [[David Tua]] and [[Julio César Chávez]].

=== Counter puncher ===
[[Counterpunch (boxing)|Counter punch]]ers are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and never telegraphing a punch for the counter puncher to generate a good offense from. To be successful using this style they must have good reflexes, intelligence, punch accuracy, and good hand speed.

Notable counter punchers include [[Salvador Sánchez]], [[Jerry Quarry]], [[Ricardo Lopez (boxer)|Ricardo Lopez]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[James Toney]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Juan Manuel Márquez]], [[Humberto Soto]] and [[Max Schmeling]].

=== Combinations of Styles ===
All fighters have a primary skillset that they feel most comfortable with, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.

=== Style matchups ===
There is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a puncher, and a puncher has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in [[rock-paper-scissors]]. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the cliché amongst boxing fans and writers that &quot;styles make fights.&quot;

Brawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be [[George Foreman]]'s knockout victory over [[Joe Frazier]].
[[File:Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Meldrick Taylor poster.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chavez versus Taylor|Taylor vs Chávez 1]]: an example of a style matchup]]
Although in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in their three fights. [[Joe Louis]], after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ [[Rocky Marciano]] would have caused him style problems even in his prime.

The boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.

An example of a style matchup was the historical fight of [[Julio César Chávez]], a swarmer or in-fighter, against [[Meldrick Taylor]], the boxer or out-fighter (see [[Chavez versus Taylor]]). The match was nicknamed &quot;Thunder Meets Lightning&quot; as an allusion to tremendous punching power of Chávez and blinding speed of Taylor. Chávez was the epitome of the &quot;Mexican&quot; style of boxing. He relentlessly stalked and closed in on the other fighter, ignoring whatever punishment he took for the chance to dish out his own at close range, particularly in the form of a crunching body attack that would either wear down his opponents until they collapsed in pain and exhaustion, or became too tired to defend as Chávez shifted his attack to the head and went for a knockout. During the fight, Taylor's brilliant hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points, but in the end, Chavez's punishment wore down Taylor and knocked him down with a tremendous right hand in the last round.

== Equipment ==
Since boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent damage to bones in the hand. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without [[hand/wrist wraps]] and [[boxing gloves]]. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilize them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. A mouth guard is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout.

Boxers practice their skills on two basic types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped &quot;speed bag&quot; is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical &quot;heavy bag&quot; filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also utilize sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, [[jump rope]], and medicine balls.

== Technique ==
=== Stance ===
The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:attitude_droite1.jpg|''Upright stance''
Image:attitude_semi-enroulée1.jpg|''Semi-crouch''
Image:attitude_enroulée1.jpg|''Full crouch''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In a fully doggy-style stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly offcenter. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the &quot;textbook&quot; stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once its been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. 

Left-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The southpaw stance, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.

North American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.

Modern boxers can sometimes be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with their feet in order to move effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg in the direction of the movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.

=== Punches ===
There are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, straight right/left hand, hook and uppercut. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* '''[[Jab]]''' – A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face. The jab is recognised as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or 'wear down' their opponents to some effect include [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]].
[[Image:Wladimir Klitschko (2008-12-13).jpg|thumb|right|175px|Ukrainian [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] heavyweight champion [[Wladimir Klitschko]].]]
* '''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]]''' – A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer is what gives the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross can also follow a jab, creating the classic &quot;one-two&quot; combination. The cross is also called a &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, especially if it does not cross the opponent's outstretched jab.

* '''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''' – A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (knuckles pointing forward) and the elbow bent. The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target. At the same time, the lead foot pivots clockwise, turning the left heel outwards. Upon contact, the hook's circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position. A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the &quot;rip&quot; to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head. The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand.Notable left hookers include:[[Joe Frazier]] and [[Mike Tyson]]

* '''[[Uppercut]]''' – A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso. At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to &quot;lift&quot; the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.

These different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or &quot;combos&quot;. The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the &quot;one-two combo&quot;. This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.

A large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;roundhouse&quot;, &quot;haymaker&quot;, or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard. Wide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.

Another unconventional punch is the rarely used &quot;[[bolo punch]]&quot;, in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.

=== Defence ===
There are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.

Image:pas_de_retrait.jpg|''[[Footwork (martial arts)|Footwork]]''
Image:retrait2.jpg|''Pulling away''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
*'''Slip''' – [[Slipping]] rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to &quot;slip&quot; past. [[Muhammad Ali]] was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early [[Mike Tyson]].

*'''Sway or fade''' – To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called &quot;rolling with the punch&quot; or &quot; Riding The Punch&quot;.

*'''Duck''' or '''break''' – To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.

*'''Bob and weave''' – [[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]] moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer &quot;weaves&quot; back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called &quot;bobbing to the outside&quot;. To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called &quot;bobbing to the inside&quot;. Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.

*'''Parry/block''' – [[Parrying]] or [[Blocking (martial arts)|blocking]] uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A &quot;palm&quot; or &quot;cuff&quot; is a block which intentionally takes the incoming punch on that portion of the defender's glove.

*'''The cover-Up''' – Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches &quot;roll&quot; off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.

*The '''[[grappling position#Stand-up positions|clinch]]''' – Clinching is a form of [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]] or a rough form of [[grappling]] and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to [[grappling hold|hold]] or &quot;tie up&quot; the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or [[uppercut]]s. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. [[Clinching position|Clinching]] is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.

====Guards====
There are several defensive positions (guards or styles) used in boxing. Within each style, there is considerable variation among fighters, as some fighters may have their guard higher for more head protection while others have their guard lower to provide better protection against body punches. Many fighters vary their defensive style throughout a bout in order to adapt to the situation of the moment, choosing the position best suited to protect them.

Boxers who use an upright stance protect their chin with the rear hand in either the low or mixed guard styles depicted below. Crouch fighters tend to use the &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; style, discussed below.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:garde_basse2.jpg| [[Low guard]]
Image:garde_mixte1.jpg| [[Mixed guard]]
Image:garde_rentrée1.jpg| [[Peek-a-Boo (boxing style)|Peek-a-boo]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

*'''[[Peek-a-Boo (boxing style)|Peek-a-boo]]''' – Sometimes known as the &quot;earmuffs&quot;, the hands are placed next to each other in front of the face (fighters tend to vary the exact positioning) and elbows are brought in tight to the body (this position can be achieved by bringing the elbows as close together while not straining yourself to do so). This defensive style is what a boxer is taught to do when he begins to box, after he gains experience he can decide to change or vary the guard. This style is middle-of-the-road style in terms of counterpunching and damage reduction. A boxer can counter punch from this stance, but it is difficult. However, there have been boxers who can do this very well. This defense covers up a fighter well, but there are holes. Hooks do damage by going around the hands and by hitting just behind the elbows. Winky Wright uses this style very well from a damage reduction stand point. Another famous example is Mike Tyson, who in his early career used the Peek-a-Boo with great success.

*'''Cross-armed''' – The forearms are placed on top of each other horizontally in front of the face with the glove of one arm being on the top of the elbow of the other arm. This style is greatly varied when the back hand rises vertically. This style is the most effective for reducing head damage. The only head punch that a fighter is susceptible to is a jab to the top of the head. The body is open, but most fighters who use this style bend and lean to protect the body, but while upright and unaltered the body is there to be hit. This position is very difficult to counterpunch from, but virtually eliminates all head damage.

*'''Philly Shell''', '''hitman''' or '''crab''' – The lead arm is placed across the torso usually somewhere in between the belly button and chest and the lead hand rests on the opposite side of the fighter's torso. The back hand is placed on the side of the face. The lead shoulder is brought in tight against the side of the face. This style is used by fighters who like to counterpunch. To execute this guard a fighter must be very athletic and experienced. This style is so effective for counterpunching because it allows fighters to slip punches by rotating and dipping their upper body and causing blows to glance off the fighter. After the punch glances off, the fighter's back hand is in perfect position to hit his out-of-positioned opponent. The shoulder lean is used in this stance. To execute the shoulder lean a fighter rotates and ducks when his opponent's punch is coming towards him and then rotates back towards his opponent while his opponent is bringing his hand back. The fighter will throw a punch with his back hand as he is rotating towards his undefended opponent. The weakness to this style is that when a fighter is stationary and not rotating he is open to be hit, so a fighter must be athletic and well conditioned to effectively execute this style. To beat this style fighters like to jab their opponent's shoulder causing the shoulder and arm to be in pain and to demobilize that arm.

Boxers generally attempt to land high, fast combinations and then quickly shift position to avoid a possible response by their opponent. Strategically, the ring's centre is generally the desired position since a boxer is able to conserve movement by forcing the opponent to circle around them. When in the centre, the boxer is also less likely to be knocked backwards against the ropes surrounding the ring and cornered. Depending on the boxer's style, the centre is the desired location as cornering opponents is always a good strategy. Most fighters, though, will not move around the boxer in the center because doing so makes them vulnerable to shots thrown at good angles. Movement is the most important tool in the ring and allows the fighter to avoid punches that were not telegraphed. If a boxer is standing still, his opponent has a better chance of hitting him. A fighter anticipating a shot while stationary is less likely to be able to evade the shot than a fighter already in motion.  &lt;!-- this section could use expansion --&gt;

=== Less common strategies ===
*'''The &quot;[[rope-a-dope]]&quot; strategy''' : Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 &quot;[[Rumble in the Jungle]]&quot; bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches.  The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as they would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target.  Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy whilst conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, [[Septuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]] skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist [[Miguel Cotto]] in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown.

*'''[[Bolo punch]]''' : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a [[circular arc]] rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former [[welterweight]] champions [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and [[Kid Gavilan]]. Middleweight champion [[Ceferino Garcia]] is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:contre_bolo1.jpg| ''[[Bolo punch]]''
Image:drop1.jpg| ''[[overhand (boxing)|Overhand (overcut)]]''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

*'''[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand right]]''' : The overhand right is a punch not found in every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the right cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand right has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over-the-shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Tim Witherspoon]], as well as MMA champions [[Chuck Liddell]] and [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. The overhand right has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking.

*'''[[Check hook]]''' : A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past.  Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport.
Floyd Mayweather Jr. employed the use of a check hook against [[Ricky Hatton]], which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down. Hatton managed to get himself to his feet after the knockdown but was clearly dazed and it was only a matter of moments before Mayweather landed a flurry of punches which sent Hatton crashing to the canvas, giving Mayweather a TKO victory in the 10th round and handing Hatton his first ever defeat.
'''

== The corner ==
In boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the [[cutman]]. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous [[physician|doctor]] responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts and blood. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts that threaten the boxer's eyes. 

In addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase &quot;to throw in the towel&quot;, meaning to give up, derives from this practice).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/throw-in-the-towel.html Phrases.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the fight between [[Diego Corrales]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]]. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.

==Medical concerns==
{{see also|The distance (boxing)#Criticisms of distance limit}}
Knocking a person unconscious or even causing [[concussion]] may cause permanent [[brain damage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm ''Boxing Brain Damage''], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person. Since 1980, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and [[Toughman Contest|Toughman]] fighters have died as the result of ring or training injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Svinth, Joseph R. [http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth_a_0700.htm &quot;Death Under the Spotlight&quot;] ''Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences'', Accessed November 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1983, the ''Journal of the [[American Medical Association]]'' called for a ban on boxing. The editor, Dr. George Lundberg, called boxing an &quot;obscenity&quot; that &quot;should not be sanctioned by any civilized society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lundberg, George D. &quot;Boxing should be banned in civilized countries.&quot; ''Journal of the American Medical Association''. 1983, pp. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the British,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma.org.uk/health_promotion_ethics/sports_exercise/BoxingPU.jsp BMA.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/3385/la_id/1.htm CMA.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama.com.au/web.nsf/doc/SHED-5F7FUG CMA.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; Medical Associations also have called for bans on boxing.

Supporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing spokesman for the [[British Medical Association]], has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: &quot;It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/87267.stm ''News on Boxing Ban''] BBC Online&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426023.000-amateur-boxers-suffer-brain-damage-too.html| title=Amateur boxers suffer brain damage too| month=08 May| year= 2007| journal=New Scientist| issue=2602 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage.&lt;ref name='amatneuro'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Does Amateur Boxing Cause Brain Damage? | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.aan.com/press/index.cfm?fuseaction=release.view&amp;release=470 | work =American Academy of Neurology | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians was established to create medical protocols through research and education to prevent injuries in boxing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaprp.org American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Thomas.

Professional boxing is forbidden in [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. It was banned in [[Sweden]] until 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6237978.stm | work=BBC News | first=Jim | last=Fish | title=Boxers bounce back in Sweden | date=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions, including four three-minute rounds for fights, were imposed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

== Boxing Hall of Fame ==
The sport of boxing has two internationally recognized boxing halls of fame; the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame|International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF)]] and the [[World Boxing Hall of Fame|World Boxing Hall of Fame (WBHF)]], with the IBHOF being the more widely recognized boxing hall of fame.

The WBHF was founded by Everett L. Sanders in 1980. Since its inception the WBHOF has never had a permanent location or museum, which has allowed the more recent IBHOF to garner more publicity and prestige. Among the notable names in the WBHF are [[Ricardo &quot;Finito&quot; Lopez]], [[Gabriel &quot;Flash&quot; Elorde]], [[Michael Carbajal]], [[Khaosai Galaxy]], [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Roberto Durán]], [[George Foreman]], [[Ceferino Garcia]],and [[Salvador Sanchez]].
Boxing's International Hall of Fame was inspired by a tribute an American town held for two local heroes in 1982. The town, [[Canastota, New York]], (which is about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Syracuse, via the New York State Thruway), honored former world [[welterweight]]/[[middleweight]] champion [[Carmen Basilio]] and his nephew, former world welterweight champion [[Billy Backus]]. The people of Canastota raised money for the tribute which inspired the idea of creating an official, annual hall of fame for notable boxers.

The [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] opened in Canastota in 1989. The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson, [[Benny Leonard]], Jack Dempsey, Henry Armstrong, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], [[Archie Moore]], and Muhammad Ali. Other world-class figures include Roberto &quot;Manos de Piedra&quot; Durán, [[Ricardo Lopez (boxer)|Ricardo Lopez]], [[Gabriel &quot;Flash&quot; Elorde]], [[Vicente Saldivar]], Ismael Laguna, Eusebio Pedroza, Carlos Monzón, Azumah Nelson, Rocky Marciano, Pipino Cuevas and [[Ken Buchanan]]. The Hall of Fame's induction ceremony is held every June as part of a four-day event.

The fans who come to Canastota for the Induction Weekend are treated to a number of events, including scheduled autograph sessions, boxing exhibitions, a parade featuring past and present inductees, and the induction ceremony itself

== Possible Shortening Of Matches in 2013 ==
Due to increasing popularity of mixed martial arts (UFC),  governing commissions have discussed shortening all professional matches by 3 rounds beginning in 2013.

'''Bollywood''' is the informal term popularly used for the [[Hindi]]-language [[film industry]] based in [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as [[Bombay]]), [[Maharashtra]], India. The term is often incorrectly used to refer to the whole of [[Indian cinema]]; it is only a part of the total Indian film industry, which includes other production centers producing films in regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985129,00.html?internalid=atm100|title=Hooray for Bollywood!|author=[[Richard Corliss]]|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''|date=16 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood is the largest film producer in India and one of the largest centers of film production in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pippa de Bruyn; Niloufer Venkatraman; Keith Bain|title=Frommer's India|year=2006|publisher=Frommer's|isbn=0471794341|page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wasko, Janet|title=How Hollywood works|year=2003|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0761968148|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

Bollywood is formally referred to as '''Hindi cinema'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gulzar; Nihalani, Govind; Chatterji, Saibal|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher= Encyclopaedia Britannica (India) Pvt Ltd.|isbn=8179910660|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC|pages=10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a growing presence of [[Indian English]] in dialogue and songs as well.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bollywood&quot; is derived from [[Mumbai|'''B'''ombay]] (the former name for Mumbai) and [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|H'''ollywood''']], the center of the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;portmanteau&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Rajghatta, Chidanand|title=Bollywood in Hollywood|date=6 July 2008|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Columnists/C_Rajghatta_Bollywood_in_Hollywood/articleshow/3201937.cms|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Hollywood, Bollywood does not exist as a physical place. Though some deplore the name, arguing that it makes the industry look like a poor cousin to Hollywood,&lt;ref name=&quot;portmanteau&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crusie, Jennifer;Yeffeth, Glenn|title=Flirting with Pride &amp; Prejudice|year=2005|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|isbn=1932100725|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has its own entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

The term &quot;Bollywood&quot; has origins in the 1970s, when India overtook America as the world's largest film producer. Credit for the term has been claimed by several different people, including the lyricist, filmmaker and scholar Amit Khanna,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amit Khanna: The Man who saw ‘Bollywood’|author=Subhash K Jha|date=8 April 2005|publisher=[[Sify]]|url=http://sify.com/movies/bollywood/fullstory.php?id=13713296|accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the journalist Bevinda Collaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Bollywood beat|author=Anand|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 March 2004|url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2004/03/07/stories/2004030700390600.htm|accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming scheme for &quot;Bollywood&quot; was inspired by &quot;Tollywood&quot;, the name that was used to refer to the [[cinema of West Bengal]]. Dating back to 1932, &quot;Tollywood&quot; was the earliest [[Hollywood-inspired names|Hollywood-inspired name]], referring to the [[Bengali cinema|Bengali film industry]] based in [[Tollygunge]], whose name is reminiscent of &quot;Hollywood&quot; and was the center of the [[cinema of India]] at the time.  &lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0921374007088054|first=Bhaskar|last=Sarkar|title=The Melodramas of Globalization|journal=Cultural Dynamics|year=2008|volume=20|pages=31–51 [34]|quote=Madhava Prasad traces the origin of the term to a 1932 article in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' by Wilford E. Deming, an American engineer who apparently helped produce the first Indian sound picture. At this point, the Calcutta suburb of Tollygunje was the main center of film production in India. Deming refers to the area as Tollywood, since it already boasted two studios with ‘several more projected’ (Prasad, 2003) ‘Tolly’, rhyming with ‘Holly’, got hinged to ‘wood’ in the Anglophone Indian imagination, and came to denote the Calcutta studios and, by extension, the local film industry. Prasad surmises: ‘Once Tollywood was made possible by the fortuitous availability of a half-rhyme, it was easy to clone new Hollywood babies by simply replacing the first letter’ (Prasad, 2003).|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), by [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], was the first silent feature film made in India. By the 1930s, the industry was producing over 200 films per annum.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gulzar; Nihalani, Govind; Chatterji, Saibal|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher= Encyclopaedia Britannica (India) Pvt Ltd.|isbn=8179910660|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian sound film, [[Ardeshir Irani]]'s ''[[Alam Ara]]'' (1931), was a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060326/spectrum/main1.htm Talking Images, 75 Years of Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming.

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], World War II, the [[Indian independence movement]], and the violence of the [[Partition of India|Partition]]. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2&quot;/&gt;

In 1937, [[Ardeshir Irani]], of ''[[Alam Ara]]'' fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, ''[[Kisan Kanya (1937 film)|Kisan Kanya]]''. The next year, he made another colour film, ''[[Mother India]]''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

===Golden Age===
Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]], the period from the late 1940s to the 1960s is regarded by film historians as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hindi cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K.

While commercial Hindi cinema was thriving, the 1950s also saw the emergence of a new [[Parallel Cinema]] movement.&lt;ref name=Gokulsing-18/&gt; Though the movement was mainly led by [[Bengali cinema]], it also began gaining prominence in Hindi cinema.

===Modern cinema===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, romance movies and action films starred actors like [[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Dharmendra]], and actresses like [[Sharmila Tagore]], [[Mumtaz (actress)|Mumtaz]], [[Leena Chandavarkar]] and [[Helen (actress)|Helen]]. In the mid-1970s, romantic confections made way for gritty, violent films about gangsters (see [[Indian mafia]]) and bandits. [[Amitabh Bachchan]], the star known for his &quot;angry young man&quot; roles, rode the crest of this trend with actors like [[Mithun Chakraborty]] and [[Anil Kapoor]], which lasted into the early 1990s. Actresses from this era included [[Hema Malini]], [[Jaya Bachchan]] and [[Rekha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actorsuntil90&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Present|author=Ahmed, Rauf|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|url=http://www.rediff.com/millenni/rauf2.htm|accessdate=2008-06-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529044434/http://www.rediff.com/millenni/rauf2.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Hindi filmmakers such as [[Shyam Benegal]] continued to produce realistic [[Parallel Cinema]] throughout the 1970s,&lt;ref name=Rajadhyaksa96-685&gt;Rajadhyaksa, 685&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[Mani Kaul]], [[Kumar Shahani]], [[Ketan Mehta]], [[Govind Nihalani]] and [[Vijaya Mehta]].&lt;ref name=Gokulsing-18/&gt; However, the 'art film' bent of the Film Finance Corporation came under criticism during a Committee on Public Undertakings investigation in 1976, which accused the body of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema. The 1970s thus saw the rise of commercial cinema in the form of enduring films such as ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), which solidified Amitabh Bachchan's position as a lead actor. The devotional classic ''[[Jai Santoshi Ma]]'' was also released in 1975.&lt;ref name=Rajadhyaksa96-688&gt;Rajadhyaksa, 688&lt;/ref&gt; Another important film from 1975 was ''[[Deewar (1975 film)|Deewar]]'', directed by [[Yash Chopra]] and written by [[Salim-Javed]]. A [[crime film]] pitting &quot;a policeman against his brother, a gang leader based on real-life smuggler [[Haji Mastan]]&quot;, portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan, it was described as being “absolutely key to Indian cinema” by [[Danny Boyle]].&lt;ref name=Kumar/&gt; The most internationally-acclaimed Hindi film of the 1980s was [[Mira Nair]]'s ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988), which won the [[Camera d'Or]] at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the pendulum swung back toward family-centric romantic musicals with the success of such films as ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'' (1988), ''[[Maine Pyar Kiya]]'' (1989), ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Kaun]]'' (1994) and ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995), making stars out of a new generation of actors (such as [[Aamir Khan]], [[Salman Khan]] and [[Shahrukh Khan]]) and actresses (such as [[Sridevi]], [[Madhuri Dixit]], [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Kajol]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;actorsuntil90&quot;/&gt; In that point of time, action and comedy films were also successful, with actors like [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] and actresses such as [[Raveena Tandon]] and [[Karisma Kapoor]] appearing in popular [[comedy film]]s, and [[stunt actor]] [[Akshay Kumar]] gaining popularity for [[Stunt performer|performing]] dangerous [[stunt]]s in [[action film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey Yount, [http://bollyspice.com/view.php/969-akshay-kumar-on-filmi-things.html Akshay Kumar on Filmi things], [[BollySpice]], 2 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akshay Kumar meets Jackie Chan in Hong Kong|date=May 20, 2004|publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2004/05/20/1112/index.html|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this decade marked the entry of new performers in [[Art films|arthouse]] and independent films, some of which succeeded commercially, the most influential example being ''[[Satya (film)|Satya]]'' (1998), directed by [[Ram Gopal Varma]] and written by [[Anurag Kashyap (director)|Anurag Kashyap]].

The 2000s saw a growth in Bollywood's popularity in the world.

The Hindi film industry has preferred films that appeal to all segments of the audience (see the discussion in Ganti, 2004, cited in references), and has resisted making films that target narrow audiences. It was believed that aiming for a broad spectrum would maximise box office receipts. However, filmmakers may be moving towards accepting some box-office segmentation, between films that appeal to rural Indians, and films that appeal to urban and overseas audiences.

==Influences for Bollywood==
Gokulsing and Dissanayake identify six major influences that have shaped the conventions of Indian popular cinema:&lt;ref name=Gokulsing&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=Gokulsing|first=K. Moti|coauthors= Dissanayake, Wimal|publisher=Trentham Books|year=2004|isbn=1858563291|pages=98–99|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ancient '''[[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]]''' of ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' which have exerted a profound influence on the thought and imagination of Indian popular cinema, particularly in its narratives. Examples of this influence include the techniques of a [[side story]], [[back-story]] and [[story within a story]]. Indian popular films often have plots which branch off into sub-plots; such narrative dispersals can clearly be seen in the 1993 films ''[[Khalnayak]]'' and ''[[Gardish]]''.&lt;ref name=Gokulsing/&gt;
* Ancient '''[[Sanskrit drama]]''', with its highly stylized nature and emphasis on spectacle, where [[Classical Indian music|music]], [[Classical Indian dance|dance]] and gesture combined &quot;to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience.&quot; Sanskrit dramas were known as ''[[Natya Shastra|natya]]'', derived from the root word ''nrit'' (dance), characterizing them as specacular dance-dramas which has continued Indian cinema.&lt;ref name=Gokulsing/&gt; The theory of ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' dating back to ancient Sanskrit drama is believed to be one of the most fundamental features that differentiate Indian cinema, particularly Hindi cinema, from that of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bollywood, Rasa and Indian Cinema: Misconceptions, Meanings and Millionaire|author=Matthew Jones|journal=Visual Anthropology|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 2010|pages=33–43|doi=10.1080/08949460903368895|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The traditional folk '''[[theatre of India]]''', which became popular from around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the [[Yatra]] of [[Bengal]], the [[Ramlila]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], and the [[Terukkuttu]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=Gokulsing/&gt;
* The '''[[Parsi]] theatre''', which &quot;blended [[Neorealism (art)|realism]] and [[fantasy]], music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of [[melodrama]]. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gokulsing/&gt;
* '''[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]''', where [[musical film|musicals]] were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s, though Indian filmmakers departed from their Hollywood counterparts in several ways. &quot;For example, the Hollywood musicals had as their plot the world of entertainment itself. Indian filmmakers, while enhancing the elements of fantasy so pervasive in Indian popular films, used song and music as a natural mode of articulation in a given situation in their films. There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, fairy stories and so on through song and dance.&quot; In addition, &quot;whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day to day lives in complex and interesting ways.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gokulsing/&gt;
* Western '''musical television''', particularly [[MTV]], which has had an increasing influence since the 1990s, as can be seen in the pace, camera angles, dance sequences and music of 2000s Indian films. An early example of this approach was in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name=Gokulsing/&gt;

==Influence of Bollywood==
In the 2000s, Bollywood began influencing [[musical film]]s in the [[Western world]], and played a particularly instrumental role in the revival of the American musical film genre. [[Baz Luhrmann]] stated that his musical film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001) was directly inspired by Bollywood musicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aa030902a.htm|title=Baz Luhrmann Talks Awards and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film incorporated an Indian-themed play based on the ancient [[Sanskrit drama]] ''[[Mṛcchakatika|The Little Clay Cart]]'' and a Bollywood-style dance sequence with a song from the film ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]''. The critical and financial success of ''Moulin Rouge!'' renewed interest in the then-moribund Western musical genre, and subsequently films such as ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]], [[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]], [[Rent (film)|Rent]]'', ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'' and ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' were produced, fueling a renaissance of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide Picks - Top Movie Musicals on Video/DVD|publisher=[[About.com]]|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aatpmusicals.htm|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood/Bollywood|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/cosmopolitan/bollywood.html|accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Rahman]], an Indian film composer, wrote the music for [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'', and a musical version of ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun]]'' has played in London's West End. The Bollywood musical ''[[Lagaan]]'' (2001) was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and two other Bollywood films ''[[Devdas (2002 film)|Devdas]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006) were nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (2008), which has won four [[66th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]] and [[81st Academy Awards nominees and winners|eight Academy Awards]], was also directly inspired by Bollywood films,&lt;ref name=Kumar&gt;{{cite web|author=Amitava Kumar|title=Slumdog Millionaire's Bollywood Ancestors|publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''|date=23 December 2008|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2008/12/slumdog-millionaires-bollywood-ancestors.html|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Age&gt;{{cite news|title=Slumdog draws crowds, but not all like what they see|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=25 January 2009|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/slumdog-draws-crowds-but-not-all-like-what-they-see-20090124-7p33.html|accessdate=2008-01-24|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be a &quot;homage to Hindi commercial cinema&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;{{cite web|title='Slumdog Millionaire' has an Indian co-director|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=11 January 2009|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200901110925.htm|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of [[reincarnation]] was also popularized in [[Reincarnation in popular western culture|Western popular culture]] through Bollywood films, with ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958) inspiring the Hollywood film ''[[The Reincarnation of Peter Proud]]'' (1975),&lt;ref name=Doniger-35&gt;{{Cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The woman who pretended to be who she was: myths of self-imitation|chapter=Chapter 6: Reincarnation|pages=112–136 [135]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0195160169|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn inspired the Bollywood film ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'' (1980), which in turn influenced another Hollywood film ''[[Chances Are (film)|Chances Are]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name=Doniger&gt;{{Cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The woman who pretended to be who she was: myths of self-imitation|chapter=Chapter 6: Reincarnation|pages=112–136 [128–31 &amp; 135]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0195160169|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 film ''[[Chhoti Si Baat]]'' is believed to have inspired ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'' (2005), which in turn inspired the Bollywood film ''[[Partner (2007 film)|Partner]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploits of a date doc|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 April 2005|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/04/15/stories/2005041503170200.htm|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Bollywood ''[[filmi]]'' music can also be seen in [[popular music]] elsewhere in the world. In 1978, the [[Electropop|technopop]] pioneers [[Haruomi Hosono]] and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] (who would form [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] band the same year) produced their first [[Electronic music|electronic]] album ''Cochin Moon'' based on an [[Experimental music|experimental]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] between electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music, including an early &quot;[[Synthpop|synth]] [[raga]]&quot; song &quot;Hum Ghar Sajan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dominique Leone|date=July 19, 2005|title=Hosono &amp; Yokoo: Cochin Moon|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devo]]'s 1988 hit song &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; was inspired by the song &quot;I am a Disco Dancer&quot; from the Bollywood film ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=T-BGltttqaE|title=DEVO - disco dancer with commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 song &quot;[[Addictive (song)|Addictive]]&quot;, sung by [[Truth Hurts]] and produced by [[DJ Quik]] and [[Dr. Dre]], was lifted from [[Lata Mangeshkar]]'s &quot;Thoda Resham Lagta Hai&quot; from ''Jyoti'' (1981).&lt;ref name=VH1&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth Hurts|publisher=[[VH1]]|date=2002-09-19|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1457672/09192002/truth_hurts.jhtml|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' [[Grammy Award]] winning 2005 song &quot;[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]&quot; was inspired by two 1970s Bollywood songs: &quot;Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana&quot; from ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978) and &quot;Ae Nujawan Hai Sub&quot; from ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name=Apradh&gt;{{YouTube|id=fWsSXjIDL3Q|title=ae naujawan hai sub kuchh yahan - Apradh 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both songs were originally composed by [[Kalyanji Anandji]], sung by [[Asha Bhosle]], and featured the dancer [[Helen (actress)|Helen]].&lt;ref name=Denselow&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Denselow|title=Kalyanji Anandji, The Bollywood Brothers|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 May 2008|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/may/02/worldmusic1|accessdate=2009-03-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, the [[Kronos Quartet]] re-recorded several [[R. D. Burman]] compositions, with [[Asha Bhosle]] as the singer, into an album ''You've stolen my heart - Songs From R D Burman's Bollywood'', which was nominated for &quot;Best Contemporary World Music Album&quot; at the 2006 Grammy Awards. ''Filmi'' music composed by [[A. R. Rahman]] (who would later win two [[Academy Award]]s for the [[Slumdog Millionaire (soundtrack)|''Slumdog Millionaire'' soundtrack]]) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the [[Singapore]]an artist [[Kelly Poon]], the [[Music of Uzbekistan|Uzbek artist]] Iroda Dilroz, the [[France|French]] rap group [[La Caution]], the American artist [[Ciara]], and the [[Germany|German]] band [[Löwenherz]],&lt;ref name=Lowenherz&gt;{{YouTube|id=afpx7qJB_ag|title=Löwenherz - Bis in die Ewigkeit}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Many [[Asian Underground]] artists, particularly those among the [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|overseas Indian diaspora]], have also been inspired by Bollywood music.

==Genre conventions==
{{see also|Masala (film genre)|Parallel Cinema}}

Bollywood films are mostly [[Musical film|musicals]], and are expected to contain catchy music in the form of song-and-dance numbers woven into the script. A film's success often depends on the quality of such musical numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Kalita, S. Mitra (2005). Suburban Sahibs: Three Immigrant Families And Their Passage from India to America. [[Rutgers University Press]], p. 134. ISBN 0-8135-3318-X&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a film's music is often released before the movie itself and helps increase the audience.

Indian audiences expect full value for their money, with a good entertainer generally referred to as ''[[paisa]]'' ''vasool'', (literally, &quot;money's worth&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangadhar, V.|title=Moving with the times|date=April 13, 2007|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/04/13/stories/2007041300860100.htm|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs and dances, love triangles, [[comedy]] and dare-devil thrills are all mixed up in a three-hour-long extravaganza with an intermission. Such movies are called ''[[Masala (film genre)|masala]]'' films, after the Hindi word for a spice mixture. Like ''masalas'', these movies are a mixture of many things such as action, comedy, romance and so on. Most films have ''heroes'' who are able to fight off villains all by themselves.
[[File:Achhut Kanya.jpg|thumb|right|Melodrama and romance are common ingredients to Bollywood films. Pictured ''[[Achhut Kanya]]'' (1936)]]
Bollywood plots have tended to be [[melodramatic]]. They frequently employ formulaic ingredients such as star-crossed lovers and angry parents, love triangles, family ties, sacrifice, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains, [[Hooker with a heart of gold|courtesans with hearts of gold]], long-lost relatives and siblings separated by fate, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences.

There have always been Indian films with more artistic aims and more sophisticated stories, both inside and outside the Bollywood tradition (see [[Parallel Cinema]]). They often lost out at the box office to movies with more mass appeal. Bollywood conventions are changing, however. A large Indian diaspora in English speaking countries, and increased [[Western culture|Western]] influence at home, have nudged Bollywood films closer to Hollywood models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gupta, Suman; Omoniyi, Tope|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nr2724-bOfMC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=bollywood+western+blue+eyes+resistance|year=2001|title=The Cultures of Economic Migration: International Perspectives|page=202|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780754670704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Lata Khubchandani writes,&quot;..our earliest films...had liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them. Strangely, it was after Independence the censor board came into being and so did all the strictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Free Reeling, PLAY, Sunday Mid-day, 11 March 2007, Mumbai. MH/MR/WEST/66/2006-08 {{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/smd/play/2007/march/153266.htm|title=Memories of another day|publisher=mid-day.com|first=Lata|last=Khubchandani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plots now tend to feature Westernised urbanites dating and dancing in clubs rather than centering on pre-arranged marriages. Though these changes can widely be seen in contemporary Bollywood, traditional conservative ways of Indian culture continue to exist in India outside the industry and an element of resistance by some to western-based influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;/&gt; Despite this, Bollywood continues to play a major role in fashion in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;/&gt; Indeed some studies into fashion in India have revealed that some people are unaware that the changing nature of fashion in Bollywood films which are presented to them are often influenced by globalisation and many consider the clothes worn by Bollywood actors as authentically Indian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;/&gt;

==Cast and crew==
:''for further details see [[Indian movie actors]], [[Indian movie actresses]], [[Indian film directors]], [[Indian film music directors]] and [[Indian playback singers]]''
Bollywood employs people from all parts of India. It attracts thousands of aspiring actors and actresses, all hoping for a break in the industry. Models and beauty contestants, television actors, theatre actors and even common people come to Mumbai with the hope and dream of becoming a star. Just as in Hollywood, very few succeed. Since many Bollywood films are shot abroad, many foreign extras are employed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where East meets West|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070630/saturday/main1.htm|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=2008-08-09|author=A. Chatterji, Shoma|publisher=[[The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stardom in the entertainment industry is very fickle, and Bollywood is no exception. The popularity of the stars can rise and fall rapidly. [[Film director|Directors]] compete to hire the most popular stars of the day, who are believed to guarantee the success of a movie (though this belief is not always supported by box-office results). Hence many stars make the most of their fame, once they become popular, by making several movies simultaneously.

Only a very few non-Indian actors are able to make a mark in Bollywood, though many have tried from time to time. There have been some exceptions, one recent example is the hit film ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'', where the lead actress is [[Alice Patten]], an Englishwoman. ''[[Kisna]]'', ''[[Lagaan]]'', and ''[[The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey]]'' also featured foreign actors. There is also [[Emma Brown Garett]], an Australian born actress, who is starring in a few Indian films.

Bollywood can be very clannish, and the relatives of film-industry insiders have an edge in getting coveted roles in films or being part of a film's crew. Industry connections are no guarantee of a long career: competition is fierce and if film industry scions do not succeed at the box office, their careers will falter. Some of the biggest stars, such as [[Dharmendra]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], and [[Shahrukh Khan]] have succeeded despite total lack of show business connections. For film clans, see [[List of Bollywood film clans]].

==Sound==
Sound in Bollywood films is rarely recorded on location (otherwise known as sync sound). Therefore, the sound is usually created (or recreated) entirely in the studio,&lt;ref name=&quot;dubbing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/News-Gossip/Did-you-Know-/Lagaan-used-synchronized-sound/articleshow/3987370.cms|title=Lagaan used synchronized sound|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the actors reciting their lines as their images appear on-screen in the studio in the process known as &quot;looping in the sound&quot; or [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]]—with the [[Voice Foley|foley]] and sound effects added later. This creates several problems, since the sound in these films usually occurs a frame or two earlier or later than the mouth movements or gestures.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubbing&quot;/&gt; The actors have to act twice: once on-location, once in the studio—and the emotional level on set is often very difficult to recreate. Commercial Indian films, not just the Hindi-language variety, are known for their lack of ambient sound, so there is a silence underlying everything instead of the background sound and noises usually employed in films to create aurally perceivable depth and environment.

The ubiquity of ADR in Bollywood cinema became prevalent in the early 1960s with the arrival of the [[Arri|Arriflex 3]] camera, which required a blimp (cover) in order to shield the sound of the camera, for which it was notorious, from on-location filming. Commercial Indian filmmakers, known for their speed, never bothered to blimp the camera, and its excessive noise required that everything had to be recreated in the studio. Eventually, this became the standard for Indian films.

The trend was bucked in 2001, after a 30-year hiatus of synchronized sound, with the film ''[[Lagaan]]'', in which producer-star [[Aamir Khan]] insisted that the sound be done on location.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubbing&quot;/&gt; This opened up a heated debate on the use and economic feasibility of on-location sound, and several Bollywood films have employed on-location sound since then.

==Bollywood song and dance==
{{see|Hindi dance songs|Filmi}}
[[File:Mukesh.jpg|thumb|150px|Songs in Bollywood are sung by professional [[playback singer]]s, rather than actors, who [[lip sync|lip-sync]] the lyrics. Pictured here is [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], a famed playback singer.]]
[[File:Bolywood.jpg|thumb|right|Bollywood dances usually follow ''[[filmi]]'' songs]]

Bollywood film music is called [[filmi]] music (from Hindi, meaning &quot;of films&quot;). Songs from Bollywood movies are generally pre-recorded by professional playback singers, with the actors then [[lip sync]]hing the words to the song on-screen, often while dancing. While most actors, especially today, are excellent dancers, few are also singers. One notable exception was [[Kishore Kumar]], who starred in several major films in the 1950s while also having a stellar career as a playback singer. [[Kundan Lal Saigal|K. L. Saigal]], Suraiyya, and [[Noor Jehan]] were also known as both singers and actors. Some actors in the last thirty years have sung one or more songs themselves; for a list, see [[Singing actors and actresses in Indian cinema]].

Playback singers are prominently featured in the opening credits and have their own [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] who will go to an otherwise lackluster movie just to hear their favourites. Going by the quality as well as the quantity of the songs they rendered, most notable singers of Bollywood are [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Geeta Dutt]], [[Shamshad Begum]] and [[Alka Yagnik]] among female playback singers; and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Manna Dey]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Kumar Sanu]], [[Udit Narayan]] and [[Sonu Nigam]] among male playback singers. Mohammed Rafi is often considered arguably the finest of the singers that have lent their voice to Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar, who, through the course of a career spanning over six decades, has recorded thousands of songs for Indian movies. The [[composer]]s of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. Their songs can make or break a film and usually do. [[Remix]]ing of film songs with modern beats and rhythms is a common occurrence today, and producers may even release remixed versions of some of their films' songs along with the films' regular [[soundtrack]] albums.

The dancing in Bollywood films, especially older ones, is primarily modelled on Indian dance: classical dance styles, dances of historic northern Indian courtesans ([[tawaif]]), or [[folk dance]]s. In modern films, Indian dance elements often blend with Western dance styles (as seen on [[MTV]] or in Broadway musicals), though it is usual to see Western pop ''and'' pure classical dance numbers side by side in the same film. The hero or heroine will often perform with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films feature unrealistically instantaneous shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in beautiful natural surroundings or architecturally grand settings. This staging is referred to as a &quot;picturisation&quot;.

Songs typically comment on the action taking place in the movie, in several ways. Sometimes, a song is worked into the plot, so that a character has a reason to sing. Other times, a song is an externalisation of a character's thoughts, or presages an event that has not occurred yet in the plot of the movie. In this case, the event is often two characters falling in love. The songs are also often referred to as a &quot;dream sequence&quot;, and anything can happen that would not normally happen in the real world.

Previously song and dance scenes often used to be shot in [[Kashmir]], but due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2935951.stm BBC News: Kashmir beckons Bollywood] (10 April 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; those scenes have since then often been shot in Western Europe, particularly in [[Switzerland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/Htmls/Ausstellungen/Archiv/2002/Bollywood/E_Bollywood.html BOLLYWOOD - The Indian Cinema and Switzerland (2002)].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/14/stories/2008021459770700.htm The Hindu: Bollywood boosts Austria’s tourism potential]. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood films have always used what are now called &quot;[[item number]]s&quot;. A physically attractive female character (the &quot;item girl&quot;), often completely unrelated to the main cast and plot of the film, performs a catchy song and dance number in the film. In older films, the &quot;item number&quot; may be performed by a courtesan (''tawaif'') dancing for a rich client or as part of a cabaret show. The actress [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] was famous for her cabaret numbers. In modern films, item numbers may be inserted as [[discotheque]] sequences, dancing at celebrations, or as stage shows.

For the last few decades Bollywood producers have been releasing the film's soundtrack, as tapes or CDs, before the main movie release, hoping that the music will pull audiences into the cinema later. Often the soundtrack is more popular than the movie. In the last few years some producers have also been releasing music videos, usually featuring a song from the film. However, some promotional videos feature a song which is not included in the movie.

==Dialogues and lyrics==
{{Main|Bollywood songs}}
The film script or lines of dialogue (called &quot;dialogues&quot; in Indian English) and the song lyrics are often written by different people.

Dialogues are usually written in an unadorned Hindi&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; or [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] that would be understood by the largest possible audience. Some movies, however, have used regional dialects to evoke a village setting, or old-fashioned, courtly, Persian-influenced [[Urdu]] in [[Mughal era]] historical films. Contemporary mainstream movies also make great use of English. Some movie scripts are first written in [[Roman alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Us Salam, Ziya|title=Assault of the mixed doubles|date=August 12, 2007|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/08/12/stories/2007081250070400.htm|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may shift from one language to the other to express a certain atmosphere (for example, English in a business setting and Hindi in an informal one).

Cinematic language, whether in dialogues or lyrics, is often melodramatic and invokes God, family, mother, duty, and self-sacrifice liberally. Song lyrics are often about love. Bollywood song lyrics, especially in the old movies, frequently use the poetic vocabulary of court Urdu, with many Persian loanwords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganti2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tejaswini Ganti|title=Bollywood: a guidebook to popular Hindi cinema|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTEa93azj9EC|accessdate=25 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415288545|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source for love lyrics is the long [[Hindu]] tradition of poetry about the amours of [[Krishna]], [[Radha]], and the [[gopi]]s, as referenced in films such as [[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]] and [[Lagaan]].

Music directors often prefer working with certain lyricists, to the point that the lyricist and composer are seen as a team. This phenomenon is like the pairings of American composers and songwriters that created old-time Broadway musicals (''e.g.,'' [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], or [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]]).

==Finances==
Bollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to 100 [[crore]]s [[Indian rupee|rupees]] (roughly [[USD]] 20 million). [[Set (drama)|Sets]], costumes, [[special effects]], and [[cinematography]] were less than world-class up until the mid-to-late 1990s, although with some notable exceptions. As Western films and television gain wider distribution in India itself, there is an increasing pressure for Bollywood films to attain the same production levels, particularly in areas such as action and special effects. Recent Bollywood films have employed international technicians to improve in these areas, such as ''[[Krrish]]'' (2006) which has action choreographed by [[Hong Kong]] based [[Tony Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The increasing accessibility to professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, has seen an explosion in the action and sci-fi genres.

Sequences shot overseas have proved a real [[box office]] draw, so Mumbai film crews are increasingly filming in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[continental Europe]] and elsewhere. Nowadays, Indian producers are winning more and more funding for big-budget films shot within India as well, such as ''[[Lagaan]]'', ''[[Devdas (2002 film)|Devdas]]'' and other recent films.

Funding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large [[Movie studio|studios]]. Indian banks and financial institutions were forbidden from lending money to movie studios. However, this ban has now been lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/mar/31sush.htm|title=Rediff: 'I &amp; B Ministry will help film industry'}}&lt;/ref&gt; As finances are not regulated, some funding also comes from illegitimate sources, such as the [[Mumbai underworld]]. The Mumbai underworld has been known to be involved in the production of several films, and are notorious for their patronisation of several prominent film personalities; On occasion, they have been known to use money and muscle power to get their way in cinematic deals. In January 2000, Mumbai mafia hitmen shot [[Rakesh Roshan]], a film director and father of star [[Hrithik Roshan]]. In 2001, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] seized all prints of the movie ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'' after the movie was found to be funded by members of the [[Mumbai underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Singh, Vijay|title=Bharat Shah sentenced, but won't have to spend time in prison|date=1 October 2003|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/oct/01shah.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem facing Bollywood is widespread [[copyright infringement]] of its films. Often, bootleg [[DVD#DVD Video|DVD]] copies of movies are available before the prints are officially released in [[movie theater|cinemas]]. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is a well established 'small scale industry' in parts of [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually in loss of revenue from pirated home videos and DVDs. Besides catering to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst some sections of the [[Indian diaspora]], too. (In fact, bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Government of Pakistan has banned their sale, distribution and telecast). Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by countless small cable TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores run by members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the UK regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance, while consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to the piracy problem.

Satellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making huge inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now fewer tend to do so. However, most Bollywood producers make money, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue, including selling ancillary rights. There are also increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly getting noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films.

For an interesting comparison of Hollywood and Bollywood financial figures, see [http://www.businessweek.com//magazine/content/02_48/art02_48/a48tab37.gif chart]. It shows tickets sold in 2002 and total revenue estimates. Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had total revenues (theatre tickets, DVDs, television and so on.) of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.3 billion, whereas Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets and generated total revenues (again from all formats) of US$51 billion.

==Advertising==
Many Indian artists used to make a living by hand-painting movie billboards and posters (The well-known artist [[M F Husain|M.F. Hussain]] used to paint film posters early in his career). This was because human labour was found to be cheaper than printing and distributing publicity material.&lt;ref name=&quot;paint&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1027777.cms|title=A different canvas|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=21 February 2005|accessdate=2008-11-21|author=Ramanan, Manju}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, a majority of the huge and ubiquitous billboards in India's major cities are created with computer-printed vinyl. The old hand-painted posters, once regarded as ephemera, are becoming increasingly collectible as [[folk art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paint&quot;/&gt;

Releasing the film music, or music videos, before the actual release of the film can also be considered a form of advertising. A popular tune is believed to help pull audiences into the theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Skelton, Tracey;Allen, Tim|title=Culture and Global Change|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415139171|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood publicists have begun to use the Internet as a venue for advertising. Most of the better-funded film releases now have their own websites, where browsers can view trailers, stills, and information about the story, cast, and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/36007765.cms|title=Bollywood wakes up to the power of Web|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=31 January 2003|accessdate=2008-11-21|author=Ferrao, Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood is also used to advertise other products. [[Product placement]], as used in Hollywood, is widely practiced in Bollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/special/y2k3/valuecreation5.htm|title=Indian Television: Leo Entertainment capitalises on film placements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood movie stars appear in print and television advertisements for other products, such as watches or soap (see [[Celebrity endorsement]]). Advertisers say that a star endorsement boosts sales.

==Awards==
The [[Filmfare Awards]] ceremony is one of the most prominent film events given for Hindi films in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1367349,prtpage-1.cms |title=Filmfare Awards gets new sponsor |publisher=Movies.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian screen magazine ''[[Filmfare]]'' started the first Filmfare Awards in 1954, and awards were given to the best films of 1953. The ceremony was referred to as the ''Clare Awards'' after the magazine's editor. Modelled after the poll-based merit format of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], individuals may submit their votes in separate categories. A dual voting system was developed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnnworld.com/filmfare.php |title=Diaspora News &amp; Network Ltd |publisher=Dnnworld.com |date=2005-03-04 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Oscars, the Filmfare awards are frequently accused of bias towards commercial success rather than artistic merit.

As the Filmfare, the [[National Film Awards]] were introduced in 1954. Since 1973, the Indian government has sponsored the National Film Awards, awarded by the government run [[Directorate of Film Festivals]] (DFF). The DFF screens not only Bollywood films, but films from all the other regional movie industries and independent/art films. These awards are handed out at an annual ceremony presided over by the President of India. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted for by both the public and a committee of experts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywoodsoundtracks.com/html/filmfareawards.htm Filmfare Awards Complete Winners List - BollywoodSoundtracks.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional ceremonies held within India are:
* [[Stardust Awards]]
* [[Star Screen Awards]]

Ceremonies held overseas are:
* [[Bollywood Movie Awards]] - [[Long Island]], New York, United States
* [[Global Indian Film Awards]] - (different country each year)
* [[IIFA Awards]] - (different country each year)
* [[Zee Cine Awards]]- (different country each year)

Most of these award ceremonies are lavishly staged spectacles, featuring singing, dancing, and numerous celebrities.

* [[Asian Academy of Film &amp; Television]]

==Popularity and appeal==

Besides being popular among the India diaspora, such far off locations as Nigeria to Egypt to Senegal and to Russia generations of non-Indian fans have grown up with Bollywood during the years, bearing witness to the cross-cultural appeal of Indian movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;samar&quot;/&gt; Over the last years of the twentieth century and beyond, Bollywood progressed in its popularity as it entered the consciousness of Western audiences and producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Us popularity&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_48/b3810013.htm Can new money create a world-class film industry in India?]. Business Week.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Historically, Hindi films have been distributed to some parts of Africa, largely by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] businessmen. ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957), for example, continued to be played in [[Nigeria]] decades after its release. Indian movies have also gained ground so as to alter the style of [[Hausa people|Hausa]] fashions, songs have also been copied by Hausa singers and stories have influenced the writings of Nigerian novelists. Stickers of Indian films and stars decorate taxis and buses in Northern Nigeria, while posters of Indian films adorn the walls of tailor shops and mechanics' garages in the country. Unlike in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] where Indian films largely cater to the expatriate Indian market yearning to keep in touch with their homeland, in [[West Africa]], as in many other parts of the world, such movies rose in popularity despite the lack of a significant Indian audience, where movies are about an alien culture, based on a religion wholly different, and, for the most part, a language that is unintelligible to the viewers. One such explanation for this lies in the similarities between the two cultures. Other similarities include wearing turbans; the presence of animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, chewing sugar cane; youths riding [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] motor scooters; wedding celebrations, and so forth. With the strict Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show &quot;respect&quot; toward women, where Hollywood movies were seen to have &quot;no shame&quot;. In Indian movies women were modestly dressed, men and women rarely kiss, and there is no [[nudity]], thus Indian movies are said to &quot;have culture&quot; that Hollywood films lack. The latter choice was a failure because &quot;they don't base themselves on the problems of the people,&quot; where the former is based [[socialist]] values and on the reality of developing countries emerging from years of colonialism. Indian movies also allowed for a new youth culture to follow without such ideological baggage as &quot;becoming western.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;samar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Larkin |first=Brian |url=http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=21 |title=Bollywood Comes To Nigeria |publisher=Samarmagazine.org |date=2002-08-31 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood is also popular among [[Somali people|Somalis]] and the Somali diaspora, where the emerging [[Islamic Courts Union]] found a [[wiktionary:bête noire|bête noire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4435366.stm|title=Cinema clashes end in Mogadishu | work=BBC News | date=2005-11-14 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chad]] and [[Ethiopia]] have also shown an interest in the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonbureau.typepad.com/nairobi/2008/08/you-from-indian.html |title=McClatchy blog: Somewhere in Africa |publisher=Washingtonbureau.typepad.com |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Bollywood personalities have avenued to the continent for both shooting movies and off-camera projects. The film ''[[Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav]]'' (2005) was one of many movies shot in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Balchand, K.|title=Lalu Prasad, at home|date=September 26, 2004|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/09/26/stories/2004092600682000.htm|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dil Jo Bhi Kahey]]'' (2005) was shot almost entirely in [[Mauritius]], which has a large ethnically Indian population.

Ominously, however, the popularity of old Bollywood versus a new, changing Bollywood seems to be diminishing the popularity on the continent. The changing style of Bollywood has begun to question such an acceptance. The new era features more sexually explicit and violent films. Nigerian viewers, for example, commented that older films of the 1950s and 1960s had culture to the newer, more westernized picturizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;samar&quot;/&gt; The old days of India avidly &quot;advocating decolonization&amp;nbsp;... and India's policy was wholly influenced by his missionary zeal to end racial domination and discrimination in the African territories&quot; were replaced by newer realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/06/13/bollywood_in_africa/ |title=Bollywood in Africa - Is it getting too Western? - How the World Works |publisher=Salon.com |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Nollywood]], Africa's local movie industry has also contributed to the declining popularity of Bollywood films. A greater [[globalization|globalised]] world worked in tandem with the sexualisation of Indian films so as to become more like American films, thus negating the preferred values of an old Bollywood and diminishing Indian [[soft power]].

===Asia===
Bollywood films are widely watched in [[South Asia]]n countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

Many Pakistanis watch Bollywood films, as they understand Hindi (due to its linguistic similarity to [[Urdu]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEE20051004061008&amp;Page=E&amp;Title=Startrek&amp;Topic=0| title=Despite official ban, Hindi movies are a craze in Pakistan| accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan banned the legal import of Bollywood movies in 1965. However, a thriving trade in pirated DVDs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=67664|title=Bollywood stumbles in Pak with Taj Mahal|accessdate=2008-11-21|publisher=[[The Indian Express]]|date=14 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illegal cable broadcasts ensured the continued popularity of Bollywood releases in Pakistan. Exceptions were made for a few films, such as the 2006 colorized re-release of the classic ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' or the 2006 film ''[[Taj Mahal]]''. Early in 2008, the Pakistani government eased the ban and allowed the import of even more movies; 16 were screened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/will-it-be-curtains-for-indian-films-in-pakistan_100137752.html|title=Will it be curtains for Indian films in Pakistan?|accessdate=2010-02-23|publisher=[[ThaIndian]]|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued easing followed in 2009 and 2010. The new policy is controversial in Pakistan. It is opposed by ardent nationalists and representatives of Pakistan's small film industry; it is embraced by cinema owners, who are booking large profits after years of poor receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?264316|title=The Mirror is Watching\accessdate=2009-02-23|publisher=[[Outlook India]]|date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood movies are also popular in [[Afghanistan]] due to the country's proximity with the Indian subcontinent and certain other cultural perspectives present in the movies.&lt;ref&gt;India, more so than Pakistan seems to share a similar style of music and musical instruments with Afghanistan. [http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/05/09/stories/2005050900561400.htm The Hindu Business Line: It's Bollywood all the way in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Bollywood movies were filmed inside Afghanistan while some dealt with the country, including ''[[Dharmatma]]'', ''[[Kabul Express]]'', ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'' and ''[[Escape From Taliban]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/08/29/kabul.tv/index.html|title=CNN World: Kabul TV bans 'explicit' Indian films, soaps | date=2002-08-29 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1679115.stm|title=BBC: Bollywood eyes Afghan market | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-12-31 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindi films have also been popular in numerous [[Arab world|Arab countries]], including Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and the [[Persian Gulf States|Gulf countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2121632.cms|title=Bollywood films gaining popularity in Gulf countries|date=8 October 2006|accessdate=2008-11-21|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|author=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Imported Indian films are usually subtitled in Arabic upon the film's release. Since the early 2000s, Bollywood has progressed in [[Israel]]. Special channels dedicated to Indian films have been displayed on cable television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041116/world.htm|title=Indian films swamp Israel|date=16 November 2004|accessdate=2008-11-21|publisher=[[The Tribune]]|author=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood films are also popular across [[Southeast Asia]] (particularly the [[Malay Archipelago]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yogendra Singh|title=Bollywood in Southeast Asia|publisher=[[Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies]]|date=19 November 2008|url=http://www.ipcs.org/article_details.php?articleNo=2734|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Central Asia]] (particularly in [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 October 1998|title=Bollywood stirs Uzbek passions|title=Indian films are known for their all singing all dancing formula|author=Louise Hidalgo|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/200689.stm|accessdate=2009-05-18 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=Wednesday, 23 June 2004|title=Bollywood bowls Tajiks over|publisher=BBC News|author=Monica Whitlock &amp; Rahim Rahimian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3834295.stm|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Hindi movies also became big successes in the [[People's Republic of China]] during the 1940s and 1950s. The most popular Hindi films in [[China]] were ''[[Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani]]'' (1946), ''[[Awaara]]'' (1951) and ''[[Two Acres of Land]]'' (1953). [[Raj Kapoor]] was a famous [[movie star]] in China, and the song &quot;Awara Hoon&quot; (&quot;I am a Tramp&quot;) was popular in the country. Since then, Hindi films significantly declined in popularity in China, until the [[Academy Award]] nominated ''[[Lagaan]]'' (2001) became the first Indian film to have a nation-wide release there in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lagaan revives memories of Raj Kapoor in China|author=Anil K.

===Europe===
The awareness of Hindi cinema is substantial in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_48/b3810013.htm|title=Can new money create a world-class film industry in India?}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they frequently enter the UK top ten. Many films, such as ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham]]'' (2001) have been set in London. Bollywood is also appreciated in [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;Francis C. Assisi.  [http://www.planetbollywood.com/displayArticle.php?id=051806123941 Bollywood Culture Binds Global Indian Diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. Various Bollywood movies are dubbed in German and shown on the German television channel [[RTL II]] on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041205/spectrum/main3.htm|title=Bollywood in Germany|publisher=[[The Tribune]]|date=5 December 2004|author=Lehmann, Ana|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood films are particularly popular in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Bollywood films have been [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into Russian, and shown in prominent theatres such as [[Mosfilm]] and [[Lenfilm]].

Ashok Sharma, Indian Ambassador to [[Suriname]], who has served three times in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] region during his diplomatic career said:
{{quote|The popularity of Bollywood in the CIS dates back to the Soviet days when the films from Hollywood and other Western countries were banned in the Soviet Union. As there was no means of other cheap entertainment, the films from Bollywood provided the Soviets a cheap source of entertainment as they were supposed to be non-controversial and non-political. In addition, the Soviet Union was recovering from the onslaught of the Second World War. The films from India, which were also recovering from the disaster of partition and the struggle for freedom from colonial rule, were found to be a good source of providing hope with entertainment to the struggling masses. The aspirations and needs of the people of both countries matched to a great extent. These films were dubbed in Russian and shown in theatres throughout the Soviet Union. The films from Bollywood also strengthened family values, which was a big factor for their popularity with the government authorities in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles/Indian-films.asp|title=Promoting Bollywood Abroad Will Help to Promote India|last=Ashreena|first=Tanya}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The film ''[[Mera Naam Joker]]'' (1970), sought to cater to such an appeal and the popularity of [[Raj Kapoor]] in Russia, when it recruited Russian actress [[Kseniya Ryabinkina]] for the movie. In the contemporary era, [[Lucky: No Time for Love]] was shot entirely in Russia. After the collapse of the Soviet film distribution system, Hollywood occupied the void created in the Russian film market. This made things difficult for Bollywood as it was losing market share to Hollywood. However, Russian newspapers report that there is a renewed interest in Bollywood among young Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/11895 RussiaToday : Features : Bollywood challenges Hollywood in Russia]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
Bollywood has experienced a marked growth in revenue in North American markets, and is particularly popular amongst the [[desi|South Asian communities]] in large cities as Chicago, Toronto and New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Us popularity&quot;/&gt; [[Yash Raj Films]], one of India's largest production houses and distributors, reported in September 2005 that Bollywood films in the United States earn around $100 million a year through theater screenings, video sales and the sale of movie soundtracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Us popularity&quot;/&gt; In other words, films from India do more business in the United States than films from any other non-English speaking country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Us popularity&quot;/&gt; Numerous films in the mid-1990s and onwards have been largely, or entirely, shot in New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver and Toronto. Bollywood's immersion in the traditional Hollywood domain was further tied with such films as ''[[The Guru (2002 film)|The Guru]]'' (2002) and ''[[Marigold: An Adventure in India]]'' (2007) trying to popularise the Bollywood-theme for Hollywood.

===Oceania===
Bollywood is not as successful in the Oceanic countries and Pacific Islands such as [[New Guinea]]. However, it ranks second to Hollywood in countries such as [[Fiji]], with its large Indian minority, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceania&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/ET_Cetera/Bollywood_clubs_popular_among_Australians/articleshow/2372640.cms|title=Bollywood clubs popular among Australians|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=2007-11-12|author=IANS|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212095151/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/ET_Cetera/Bollywood_clubs_popular_among_Australians/articleshow/2372640.cms|archivedate=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is one of the countries where there is a large South Asian Diaspora. Bollywood is popular amongst non-Asians in the country as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceania&quot;/&gt; Since 1997 the country has provided a backdrop for an increasing number of Bollywood films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceania&quot;/&gt; Indian filmmakers have been attracted to Australia's diverse locations and landscapes, and initially used it as the setting for song-and-dance sequences, which demonstrated the contrast between the values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceania&quot;/&gt; However, nowadays, Australian locations are becoming more important to the plot of Bollywood films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceania&quot;/&gt; Hindi films shot in Australia usually incorporate aspects of Australian lifestyle. The [[Yash Raj Films|Yash Raj Film]] ''[[Salaam Namaste]]'' (2005) became the first Indian film to be shot entirely in Australia and was the most successful Bollywood film of 2005 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phillips, Mark|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Bollywood-on-Bourke-Street/2005/05/12/1115843307939.html|title=Bollywood on Bourke Street|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=13 May 2005|accessdate=2008-08-18|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''[[Heyy Babyy]]'' (2007) ''[[Chak De!

===South America===
Bollywood movies are not influential in South America, though Bollywood culture and dance is recognised. In 2006, ''[[Dhoom 2]]'' became the first Bollywood film to be shot in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/15sfa.htm|title=Will Hrithik's Dhoom 2 prove lucky for Brazil?|date=15 September 2006|author=Firdaus Ashraf, Syed|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism==
Constrained by rushed production schedules and small budgets, some Bollywood writers and musicians have been known to resort to [[plagiarism]]. Ideas, plot lines, tunes or riffs have been copied from other [[Cinema of India|Indian film industries]] or foreign films (including [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and other [[Asian cinema|Asian films]]) without acknowledgement of the original source. This has led to criticism towards the film industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/html/uncomp/articleshow?msid=46715385|title=Plagiarism issue jolts Bollywood.|publisher=The Times Of India|accessdate=2007-10-17|first1=Meenakshi|last1=Shedde|date=2003-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1990s, this could be done with impunity. [[Copyright]] enforcement was lax in India and few actors or directors ever saw an official contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayres&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayres, Alyssa; Oldenburg, Philip|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gi7w-vTfELsC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=bollywood+plagiarism#PPA174,M1|title=India briefing: takeoff at last|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2005|page=174|isbn=9780765615930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindi film industry was not widely known to non-Indian audiences (excluding the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states), who would not even be aware that their material was being copied. Audiences may also not have been aware of the plagiarism since many audiences in India were unfamiliar with foreign films and music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot;/&gt; While copyright enforcement in India is still somewhat lenient, Bollywood and other film industries are much more aware of each other now and Indian audiences are more familiar with foreign movies and music. Organizations like the India EU Film Initiative seek to foster a community between film makers and industry professional between India and the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot;/&gt;

One of the common justifications of plagiarism in Bollywood in the media is that producers often play a safer option by remaking popular Hollywood films in an Indian context. Screenwriters generally produce original scripts, but due to financial uncertainty and insecurity over the success of a film many were rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot;/&gt; Screenwriters themselves have been criticised for lack of creativity which happened due to tight schedules and restricted funds in the industry to employ better screenwriters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2003/08/03/stories/2003080300090400.htm|title=Cloning Hollywood|date=3 August 2003|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain filmmakers see plagiarism in Bollywood as an integral part of globalisation where American and western cultures are firmly embedding themselves into Indian culture, which is manifested, amongst other mediums, in Bollywood films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;/&gt; [[Vikram Bhatt]], director of films such as ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', a remake of ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'', and ''[[Kasoor]]'', a remake of ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'', has spoken about the strong influence of American culture and desire to produce box office hits based along the same lines in Bollywood. He said, &quot;Financially, I would be more secure knowing that a particular piece of work has already done well at the box office. Copying is endemic everywhere in India. Our TV shows are adaptations of American programmes. We want their films, their cars, their planes, their [[Diet Coke]]s and also their attitude. The American way of life is creeping into our culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;/&gt; [[Mahesh Bhatt]] has said, &quot;If you hide the source, you're a genius. There's no such thing as originality in the creative sphere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;/&gt;

There have been very few cases of film copyright violations taken to court because of serious delays in the legal process, and due to the long time they take to decide a case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot;/&gt; There have been some notable cases of conflict though. The makers of ''[[Partner (2007 film)|Partner]]'' (2007) and ''[[Zinda (film)|Zinda]]'' (2005) have been targeted by the owners and distributors of the original films, ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'' and ''[[Oldboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Partner_may_face_30_mn_Hitch/articleshow/2264000.cms/| title=Partner may face $30&amp;nbsp;mn Hitch | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/01/20/stories/2006012002530300.htm|title=Copycat filmmaker lacks creativity|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 January 2006|accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Studio [[Twentieth Century Fox]] brought the Mumbai-based B.R.

'''Bowls''' (also '''lawn bowls''', variants include '''flat-green bowls''' and '''crown-green bowls''' ) is a [[lawn game]] in which the objective is to roll slightly asymmetric balls so that they stop close to a smaller &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;kitty&quot;. It is played on a pitch which may be flat (for &quot;flat-green bowls&quot;) or convex (for &quot;crown-green bowls&quot;). It is normally played outdoors although there are some indoor venues and the surface is either natural grass, [[artificial turf]], or [[cotula]] (in [[New Zealand]]).

It is popular in [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[Hong Kong]] and parts of the [[United States]] and more recently in [[Japan]]. It belongs to the [[boules]] sport family and is related to [[bocce]] and [[pétanque]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Bowls match.JPG|thumb|Bowls match in progress at [[Wookey Hole]], [[United Kingdom]]]]
It has been traced certainly to the 13th century, and conjecturally to the 12th. [[William Fitzstephen]] (d. about 1190), in his biography of [[Thomas Becket]], gives a graphic sketch of the [[London]] of his day and, writing of the summer amusements of the young men, says that on holidays they were &quot;exercised in Leaping, Shooting, Wrestling, Casting of Stones [in jactu lapidum], and Throwing of Javelins fitted with Loops for the Purpose, which they strive to fling before the Mark; they also use Bucklers, like fighting Men.&quot; It is commonly supposed that by jactus lapidum, Fitzstephen meant the game of bowls, but though it is possible that round stones may sometimes have been employed in an early variety of the game - and there is a record of iron bowls being used, though at a much later date, on festive occasions at Nairn, - nevertheless the inference seems unwarranted. The jactus lapidum of which he speaks was probably more akin to the modern &quot;putting the weight,&quot; once even called &quot;putting the stone.&quot; It is beyond dispute, however, that the game, at any rate in a rudimentary form, was played in the 13th century. A manuscript of that period in the royal library, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] (No. 20, E iv.), contains a drawing representing two players aiming at a small cone instead of an earthenware ball or jack. The world's oldest surviving bowling green is the [[Southampton Old Bowling Green]], which was first used in 1299.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A311482|title=Southampton Old Bowling Green, Southampton, England|accessdate=6 January 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another manuscript of the same century has a crude but spirited picture which brings us into close touch with the existing game.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Three figures are introduced and a jack. The first player's bowl has come to rest just in front of the jack; the second has delivered his bowl and is following after it with one of those eccentric contortions still not unusual on modern greens, the first player meanwhile making a repressive gesture with his hand, as if to urge the bowl to stop short of his own; the third player is depicted as in the act of delivering his bowl. A 14th-century manuscript, Book of Prayers, in the [[Francis Douce]] collection in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] contains a drawing in which two persons are shown, but they bowl to no mark. Strutt (Sports and Pastimes) suggests that the first player's bowl may have been regarded by the second player as a species of jack; but in that case it is not clear what was the first player's target. In these three earliest illustrations of the pastime it is worth noting that each player has one bowl only, and that the attitude in delivering it was as various five or six hundred years ago as it is to-day. In the third he stands almost upright; in the first he kneels; in the second he stoops, halfway between the upright and the kneeling position.

As the game grew in popularity, it came under the ban of king and parliament, both fearing it might jeopardise the practice of archery, then so important in battle. Statutes forbidding it and other sports were enacted in the reigns of [[Edward III]], [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and other monarchs. Even when, on the invention of gunpowder and firearms, the bow had fallen into disuse as a weapon of war, the prohibition was continued. The discredit attaching to bowling alleys, first established in London in 1455, probably encouraged subsequent repressive legislation, for many of the alleys were connected with taverns frequented by the dissolute and gamesters. The word &quot;bowls&quot; occurs for the first time in the statute of 1511 in which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] confirmed previous enactments against unlawful games. By a further act of 1541—which was not repealed until 1845—artificers, labourers, apprentices, servants and the like were forbidden to play bowls at any time except [[Christmas]], and then only in their master's house and presence. It was
