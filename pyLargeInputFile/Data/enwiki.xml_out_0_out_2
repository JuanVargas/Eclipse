[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the ''Huygens'' probe, which indicate that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_science-results_0121.html Titan: Arizona in an Icebox?], Emily Lakdawalla, 21 January 2004, verified 28 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Also on Titan, a methane-spewing volcano was spotted and this volcanism is believed to be a significant source of the methane in the atmosphere. There also appear to be Methane/Ethane lakes near the north polar regions of Titan, as discovered by Cassini's radar imaging. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] have also been detected in the tail of the comet [[Hyakutake]]. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;science&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mumma, M.J. | title=Detection of Abundant Ethane and Methane, Along with Carbon Monoxide and Water, in Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake: Evidence for Interstellar Origin | journal=Science | year=1996 | volume=272 | page=1310 | doi=10.1126/science.272.5266.1310 | pmid=8650540 | coauthors = Disanti, M.A., dello Russo, N., Fomenkova, M., Magee-Sauer, K., Kaminski, C.D., and D.X. Xie | issue=5266 | bibcode=1996Sci...272.1310M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkanes have also been detected in [[meteorite]]s such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s.

===Occurrence of alkanes on Earth===
Traces of methane gas (about 0.0001% or 1 ppm) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by organisms such as [[Archaea]], found for example in the gut of cows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The most important commercial sources for alkanes are [[natural gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some [[propane]] and [[butane]]: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other [[hydrocarbons]]. These hydrocarbons were formed when dead marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These hydrocarbons collected in porous rocks, located beneath an impermeable cap rock and so are trapped. These deposits, e.g., [[oil fields]], have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]].

Solid alkanes are known as [[tar]]s and are formed when more volatile alkanes such as gases and oil [[evaporation|evaporate]] from hydrocarbon deposits. One of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in the [[asphalt]] lake known as the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

Methane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]].

Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane hydrate]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}};methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore a candidate for future fuels.

===Biological occurrence===
Although alkanes occur in nature in various way, they do not rank biologically among the essential materials. Cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in [[musk]], extracted from [[deer]] of the family [[Moschidae]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} All further information refers to (acyclic) alkanes.

;Bacteria and archaea
[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]]
Certain types of [[bacteria]] can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

On the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release up to 150&amp;nbsp;liters per day,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and of [[termite]]s,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of [[natural gas]] were formed in a similar way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

;Fungi and plants
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In plants, the solid long-chain alkanes are found in the [[plant cuticle]] and [[epicuticular wax]] of many species, but are only rarely major constituents.&lt;ref name=Baker1982&gt;EA Baker (1982) Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes. pp139-165. In &quot;The Plant Cuticle&quot;. edited by DF Cutler, KL Alvin and CE Price. Academic Press, London. ISBN 0-12-199920-3&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between twenty-seven and thirty-three carbon atoms in length&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt; and are made by the plants by [[decarboxylation]] of even-numbered [[fatty acid]]s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent, but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

;Animals
Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% [[pristane]] (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;).{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Their occurrence is more important in [[pheromone]]s, chemical messenger materials, on which above all insects are dependent for communication. With some kinds, as the support beetle ''[[Xylotrechus colonus]]'', primarily [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;), 3-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;), they are transferred by body contact. With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;), and acts by smell over longer distances, a useful characteristic for [[pest control]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} [[waggle dance|Waggle-dancing]] [[honeybees]] produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.&lt;ref&gt;Thom et al. (21 August 2007) The Scent of the Waggle Dance. PLoS Biology. Vol. 5, No. 9, e228 doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228 [http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?SESSID=d90be2bec6c40a2881c3b91547db7e22&amp;request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological relations===
[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]'')]]
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[heptacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

==Production==
===Petroleum refining===
[[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez, California|Martinez]], [[California]].]]
As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is [[natural gas]] and [[crude oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Alkanes are separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products.

===Fischer-Tropsch===
The [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for [[petroleum distillates]].

===Laboratory preparation===
There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally non-reactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo [[functional group interconversion]]s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] as a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] gives the conjugate acid, n-butane as a side-product:

: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; + [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]]

However, at times it may be desirable to make a portion of a molecule into an alkane like functionality ([[alkyl]] group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an [[ethyl group]] is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group, it gives [[ethanol]], which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s:

:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (R = [[alkyl]])

Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction]]. The [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1-link=Derek Harold Richard Barton| last1=Barton |first1= D. H. R. |last2= McCombie |first2= S.

Syn.'' 1991, ''8'', 309-313.(Review)&lt;/ref&gt; removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl-substituted compounds e.g.:
:[[Image:Clemmensen Reduction Scheme.png|250px|[[Clemmensen Reduction]]]]

==Applications==
The applications of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

[[Propane]] and [[butane]] can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner, butane in disposable cigarette lighters. The two alkanes are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.

From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are reasonably volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].

Some synthetic [[polymers]] such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.

==Environmental transformations==
When released in the environment, alkanes don't undergo rapid biodegradation, because they have no functional groups (like [[hydroxyl]] or [[carbonyl]]) that are needed by most organisms in order to metabolize the compound.

However, some bacteria can metabolize some alkanes (especially those linear and short), by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] the terminal carbon atom. The product is an [[alcohol]], that could be next oxidized to an [[aldehyde]], and finally to a [[carboxylic acid]]. The resulting [[fatty acid]] could be metabolized through the [[fatty acid degradation]] pathway.

==Hazards==
Methane is explosive when mixed with air (1 – 8% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane are classed as ''dangerous for the environment'' and ''harmful''. The straight-chain isomer of hexane is a [[neurotoxin]]. Halogen-rich alkanes, like [[chloroform]], can be carcinogenic as well.

In [[law]], an '''appeal''' is a process for requesting a formal change to an official decision.

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from country to country. Even within a [[jurisdiction]], the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case.

An [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of [[law]], [[fact]], or procedure (in the United States, [[due process]]).

In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

==Access to appellant status==
A party who files an appeal is called an '''appellant''', '''plaintiff in error''', '''petitioner''' or '''pursuer''', and a party on the other side is called a '''respondent''' (in most [[common-law]] countries), '''defendant in error''', '''appellee''' (in the United States) or '''defender''' (under [[Scots law]]). A '''cross-appeal''' is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.

The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their [[lawsuit|claim]] in a [[lower court]] decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.

The appellant in the new case can be either the [[plaintiff]] (or ''claimant''), [[defendant]], third-party intervenor, or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.  For example, in ''Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd'' [1969] 2 QB 158,&lt;!-- what court/country? English Court of Queen's Bench--&gt; the claimant appealed (successfully) on the basis that, although he won in the court below, the lower court had applied the wrong measure of damages and he had not been fully recompensated.

An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court [[judgment (law)|judgment]] was in its favor. The appellee is required to respond to the [[petition]], [[oral argument]]s, and [[legal brief]]s of the appellant. In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.

==Ability to appeal==
An appeal '''''as of right''''' is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal ''by leave'' or ''permission'' requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision. A good example of this is the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], in which review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/10.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, appeal as of rights to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] are available, for example, in criminal cases where there is dissent on a point of law in a provincial court of appeal.

In [[tort]], [[equity (law)|equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal ''as of right''.  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, in the United States the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal ''as of right'' from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law ''by leave'' from the trial court and/or the appellate court.  The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html|title=Consultation Paper on Prosecution Appeals Brought in Cases of Indictment|publisher=Law Reform Commission of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.

By convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first.  This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy. This is not always true, however.  In the [[United States federal courts]], the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the [[United States Courts of Appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the [[United States Supreme Court]].

In Canada, criminal cases, including appeals, are always styled in the form ''R. v. defendant'', where ''R'' represents the Latin word ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', or the King or Queen, who is the presumed plaintiff in all criminal trials.  Acquittals in criminal cases in Canada also are appealable, so the style of a criminal appeal is always the same whether the appellant is the defendant or prosecution.

Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the [[criminal]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/postconv.htm|title=UK Law Online |publisher=University of Leeds }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt|title=Special Habeas Corpus Procedures in Capital Cases |publisher=United States Office of the Law Revision Counsel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc|title=State of Ohio |publisher=Ohio 12th District Court of Appeals |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227072142/http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the traditional &quot;direct&quot; appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review.  The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.

The key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.

Relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in [[capital punishment|capital]] or violent [[felony]] cases.  The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating [[DNA]] evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.

===Appellate review===
'''Appellate review''' is the general term for the process by which [[court]]s with appellate [[jurisdiction]] take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts. It is distinguished from [[Judicial review (theory)|judicial review]], which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).

In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case.  This is because such orders cannot be appealed ''as of right''. However, certain critical interlocutory [[court order]]s, such as the denial of a request for an interim [[injunction]], or an order holding a person in [[contempt of court]], can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.

In American law, there are two distinct forms of appellate review, ''direct'' and ''collateral''. For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on ''direct appeal'' to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a ''collateral'' action such as filing for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. Generally speaking, &quot;[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial.&quot; ''Graham v. Borgen'', __ F 3d. __ (7th Cir. 2007) (no. 04-4103) (slip op. at 7) (citation omitted).

In Anglo-American [[common law]] courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by [[prerogative writ]] in certain cases.  There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems, though some mixed systems such as [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec]] recognize these prerogative writs.

====Direct Appeal====
After exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bickford|first=James|title=Opinion Recap:All Judicial Review is either direct or collateral|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/opinion-summary-all-judicial-review-is-either-direct-or-collateral/|work=Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act|publisher=SCOTUS Bblog|accessdate=4/5/11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case. On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.

=====Preservation Issues=====
An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This mean that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dauman|first=Chad|title=Criminal Appeals in the United States: Preservation Issues|url=http://www.Chaddauman.blogspot.com|work=blog|accessdate=4/27/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal====
Some States will also have '''post conviction proceedings.'''Similar to federal habeas, an appellant can petition the post conviction court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yackle|first=Larry|title=Federal Courts, Habeas Corpus|year=2003|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence. These proceedings are separate from the direct appeal. As such, the conviction is considered final. An appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process For Post-Conviction Relief|url=http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pdf/pcvap_handout_post_conviction.pdf|work=Oregon Department of Justice|publisher=Oregon Department of Justice|accessdate=4/27,11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Habeas Corpus====
''See'' [[Habeas corpus in the United States]]

==Notice of appeal==
A '''notice of appeal''' is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.

The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.

Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site.

The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rule 4(b)(1)(A)|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_00000004----000-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appellate procedure==
{{globalize|section|common-law countries|date=March 2011}}
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the [[law]] that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).

If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it.  It may, in addition, send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.

In some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision ''de novo'' (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.

Another situation is where appeal is by way of ''re-hearing''. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court. An example would be an appeal from a [[magistrates' court]] to the [[Crown Court]] in [[England and Wales]].

Sometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)  In England and many other jurisdictions, however, the phrase ''appeal dismissed'' is equivalent to the [[United States|U.S.]] term ''affirmed''; and the phrase ''appeal allowed'' is equivalent to the U.S. term ''reversed''.

Generally, there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed&amp;mdash;unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in ''very'' rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].

In some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate [[lawyer]]s, if represented, or ''[[pro se]]'' if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

In an [[adversarial system]], appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against [[legal precedent]], that judgment will stand if not appealed - even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

==United States==
{{See also|United States court of appeals}}
The [[United States]] legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial ''de novo'' or an appeal on the record.

A [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial ''de novo'' by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In some cases, an application for ''trial de novo'' effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place.  The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '&quot;This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to &quot;annul[] the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.&quot;' &lt;ref&gt;''Gaskill v. Commonwealth'', 206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. &quot;[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,
permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Kenyon v. Commonwealth'', 37 Va. App. 668, 673, 561 S.E.2d 17, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the [[jury]] on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.

In cases where a [[judge]] rather than a [[jury]] decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an ''abuse of discretion'' standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some rare cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case ''and'' that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

In the United States, a [[lawyer]] traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;

After an appeal is heard, the ''mandate'' is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's [[court opinion|opinion]], which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision. In some U.S. jurisdictions the mandate is known as the ''remittitur''.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
Generally, an '''answer''' is a reply to a question or is a solution, a retaliation, or a response that is relevant to the said question.

In law, an '''answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to some one or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a [[reply]] to a [[question]] or response, or [[objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anonymous|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]], an '''answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]].

The ''answer'' establishes which allegations ([[cause of action]] in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant's [[Defense (legal)|defenses]], thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the [[court]].

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either [[guilt]]y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or a permanent [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentium'' (&quot;answers of the learned ones&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman [[lawyer]]s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In music an &quot;'''answer'''&quot; (also known as [[countersubject]]) is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition or modification by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

{{Globalize/USA|date=September 2010}}

An '''appellate court''', commonly called an '''''appeals court''''' or '''''court of appeals''''' ([[American English]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/court%20of%20appeals]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''appeal court''''' ([[British English]]), is any [[court of law]] that is empowered to hear an [[appeal]] of a [[trial court]] or other lower [[tribunal]]. In most [[jurisdiction]]s, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a [[supreme court]] (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Supreme+Court?r=66 Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law and Collins English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate courts worldwide can operate by varying rules.

==Institutional titles==
Many U.S. jurisdictions title their appellate court a '''''court of appeal''''' or '''''court of appeals'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''court of appeals'' is not capitalized in carefully edited texts such as reference works, for example [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Court+of+Appeal West's Encyclopedia of American Law] unless referring to a specific court or courts, but many legal professionals do not comply with this most common English usage shown in major dictionaries and instead capitalize this and many other common nouns in legal texts.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, others have titled their appellate court a '''''court of errors''''' (or '''''court of errors and appeals'''''), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]] (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]]), the Kentucky Court of Errors (since renamed the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]]), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi]]). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an '''appellate division'''.

Depending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on the one hand, and appeals from the [[Court of Federal Claims]] on the other.

==Authority to review==
The authority of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review. For example, in the [[United States]], both state and [[United States court of appeals|federal]] appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the court below made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were. Furthermore, U.S. appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court. Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.

In most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of [[discretionary review]], meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.

'''Arraignment''' is a formal reading of a [[crime|criminal]] [[complaint]] in the presence of the [[defendant]] to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of &quot;[[nolo contendere]]&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;[[Alford plea]]&quot; are allowed in some circumstances. 

In England, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]], arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge. This process is the same in Australian jurisdictions. 

In federal courts in the United States, arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the '''initial arraignment''' and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest. During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set bail. During the second arraignment, a '''post-indictment arraignment''' or '''PIA''', the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.

==Form of the arraignment==
The wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;In some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it generally conforms with the following principles:
# The accused person ([[defendant]]) is addressed by [[name]];
# The [[criminal charge|charge]] against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offence; and,
# The accused person is asked formally how he or she [[plea]]ds.

==Guilty and not-guilty pleas==
If the defendant pleads guilty, an [[Preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

If the defendant pleads [[not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[Jury trial|trial]].

In the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or &quot;stood mute&quot;) was subject to [[Crushing|peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for &quot;strong and hard punishment&quot;). Today in common-law jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.&lt;ref&gt;In Queensland, Australia, this matter is covered by statute. See s601 of the Queensland [[Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this is the defendant's [[right to silence]].

==Pre-trial Release==
This is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail are made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.

==United States Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure==
Under the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], &quot;arraignment shall [...] [consist of an] open [...] reading [of] the [[indictment]] [...] to the defendant [...] and call[] on him to plead thereto. He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment [...] before he/she is called upon to plead.&quot;

 [[File:5 America, the Beautiful.png|right|thumb|300px|Sheet music version]]
&quot;'''America the Beautiful'''&quot; is an [[United States|American]] [[patriotic song]]. The lyrics were written by [[Katharine Lee Bates]] and the music composed by church organist and choirmaster [[Samuel A. Ward]].

Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, ''Pikes Peak'', first published in the [[Fourth of July]] edition of the church periodical ''The Congregationalist'' in 1895. At that time, the poem was titled ''America'' for publication.

Ward had originally written the music, ''Materna'', for the 19th century hymn ''[[O Mother dear, Jerusalem]]'' in 1882. Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled ''America the Beautiful''.

The song is one of the most beloved and popular of the many American patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.100010615/full.html&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time it has been proposed as a replacement for ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' as the National Anthem.

==History==
In 1893, at the age of thirty-three, Bates, an English professor at [[Wellesley College]], had taken a train trip to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado, to teach a short summer school session at [[Colorado College]]. Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], the &quot;White City&quot; with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from high atop Zebulon's [[Pikes Peak]].

On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later in ''The Congregationalist,'' to commemorate the Fourth of July. It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.

Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. A [[hymn tune]] composed by Samuel A. Ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward too was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]], after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. He was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on, thus perhaps the ''off the cuff'' analogy. He composed the tune for the old hymn &quot;O Mother Dear, Jerusalem&quot;, retitling the work &quot;Materna&quot;. Ward's music combined with Bates' poem were first published together in 1910 and titled, ''America the Beautiful''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cameronsbrown.com/Resources/Other/america%2520the%2520beautiful.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain, as the music was only first applied to the song in 1904. Bates was more fortunate, as the song's popularity was well-established by her death in 1929.

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Some prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; over &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. Others prefer &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the same reason, or for the reason that it does not directly invoke God. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.

The words of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] can be sung as verses of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marryleapyear.com|last=www.marryleapyear.com|title=Fourteenth Amendment Song|accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an appropriate [[mnemonic]] for the amendment which in 1868 declared African Americans to be full citizens of the United States.

When [[Richard Nixon]] visited the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, this song was played by Chinese as the welcome music.  The [[Chinese character]]s for United States literally mean &quot;Beautiful Country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=About: Chinese Culture |title=Lucky Symbols |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/picks/aatp_luckysymbols.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of [[religion|religious]] congregations in the United States.

==Popular versions==
Three different renditions of the song have entered the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The first was by [[Charlie Rich]], which went to number 22 in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitburn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=350|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second, by [[Mickey Newbury]], peaked at number 82 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; An [[all-star]] version of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; performed by [[country music]] singers [[Trace Adkins]], [[Billy Dean]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Lonestar]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Jamie O'Neal]], [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Keith Urban]] reached number 58 in July 2001. The song re-entered the chart following the September 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularity of the song increased greatly following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem.  During the first taping of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' following the attacks, CBS newsman [[Dan Rather]] cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2001-09-18 |work=Salon.com |title=Dan Rather's tears; Journalists don't cry on camera. That was before last week. |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2001/09/18/rather/index.html |first=Stephanie |last=Zacharek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Charles]] is credited with the song's most well known rendition in current times (although [[Elvis Presley]] had success with it in the 1970s). Charles' recording is very commonly played at major sporting events, such as the [[Super Bowl]], and [[WrestleMania]]; Charles gave a live performance of the song prior to [[Super Bowl XXXV]], the last Super Bowl played before the September 11 terrorist attacks. He places the third verse first, after which he sings the usual first verse. In the third verse (see below), the author scolds the [[materialistic]] and self-serving [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]] of her day, and urges America to live up to its noble ideals and to honor, with both word and deed, the memory of those who died for their country. He also performed the song on Red Sox opening day at Fenway Park in 2003, though the game was eventually rained out.

Symbolically, [[Marian Anderson]] (a noted opera singer of her day) sang a rendition of America on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in 1939 after being refused use of Constitution Hall by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] because of her skin color.

In 2009, on her album &quot;Running for the Drum&quot;, [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]] released a new version of American the Beautiful.  Her version contained some new lyrics, as well as a small modification of the melody.  Her lyrics take the first verse as hers, but give a different verse as her second of only two verses to her version.  Her second verse is:

:O beautiful for vision clear,
:That sees beyond the years,
:The nightime sky, our hopes that fly,
:Undimmed by human tears.

:America! America!
:God shed His grace on thee,
:'Til selfish gain no longer stain,
:The banner of the free.

:And crown they good with brotherhood,
:From sea to shining sea.

==Idioms==
'''&quot;From sea to shining sea&quot;''' is an [[United States|American]] [[idiom]] meaning from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (or vice versa).  Many songs have used this term, including the American patriotic songs &quot;America, The Beautiful&quot; and &quot;[[God Bless the USA]]&quot;.  In addition to these, it is also featured in [[Schoolhouse Rock]]'s &quot;Elbow Room&quot;.  A term similar to this is the [[Canada|Canadian]] motto ''[[A Mari Usque Ad Mare]]'' (&quot;From sea to sea.&quot;)

==Books==
*[[Lynn Sherr]]'s 2001 book ''America the Beautiful'' discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth. ISBN 1-58648-085-5. The book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of &quot;[[Auld Lang Syne]]&quot;; the songs can be sung interchangeably.
*Barbara Younger has written a children's book about the writing of the song: ''Purple Mountain Majesties: The Story of Katharine Lee Bates and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;''. The book has illustrations by artist Stacey Schuett.

[[File:Hoergeraet analog 050609.jpg|thumb|250px|Hearing aid]]
'''Assistive technology''' or '''adaptive technology''' (AT) is an [[umbrella term]] that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[disability|people with disabilities]] and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. AT promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to or changed methods of interacting with the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks.

Likewise, disability advocates point out that technology is often created without regard to people with disabilities, creating unnecessary barriers to hundreds of millions of people. Even the makers of AT technologies will often still argue that [[universal design]] is preferable to the need for AT and that universal design projects and concepts should be continuously expanded.

{{Disability}}

==Assistive technology and universal accessibility==
[[Image:Accessible Cross.JPG|thumb|250px|Universally Accessible Street Cross at [[Evanston, Illinois]] ]]
Universal (or broadened) accessibility, or [[universal design]] means greater [[usability]], particularly for people with disabilities.

Universally accessible technology yields great rewards to the typical user as well; good accessible design ''is'' universal design. One example is the &quot;[[curb cut]]s&quot; (or dropped curbs) in the sidewalk at street crossings. While these curb cuts enable pedestrians with mobility impairments to cross the street, they also aid parents with carriages and strollers, shoppers with carts, and travelers and workers with pull-type bags.

As an example, the modern [[telephone]] is inaccessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Combined with a [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|text telephone]] (also known as a TDD [[Telecommunications device for the deaf]] and in the USA generally called a [[Teleprinter|TeleTYpewriter]] or TTY), which converts typed characters into tones that may be sent over the telephone line, a deaf person is able to communicate immediately at a distance. Together with &quot;relay&quot; services, in which an operator reads what the deaf person types and types what a hearing person says, the deaf person is then given access to everyone's telephone, not just those of people who possess text telephones. Many telephones now have volume controls, which are primarily intended for the benefit of people who are hard of hearing, but can be useful for all users at times and places where there is significant background noise. Some have larger keys well-spaced to facilitate accurate dialing.

Also, a person with a mobility impairment can have difficulty using [[calculator]]s. [[Speech recognition]] software recognizes short commands and makes use of calculators easier.

People with [[learning disabilities]] like [[dyslexia]] or [[dysgraphia]] are using [[text-to-speech]] (TTS) software for reading and [[spelling]] programs for assistance in writing texts.

Computers, with their hardware extensibility, editing, [[spellchecking]] and [[speech synthesis]] software are becoming the cornerstone of assistive technologies, improving quality of life for those with [[learning disabilities]] and [[visual impairments]]. Spell assist programs and voice-recognition facilities are also bringing the text reading and writing experience to the wider public.

Toys that have been adapted to be used by children with disabilities might have advantages for  non-disabled children as well. The [[Lekotek]] movement assists parents by lending assistive technology toys and expertise to families.

Many health professionals may be certified by RESNA (RESNA.org) to serve assistive technology needs: occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech language pathologists/audiologists, orthotists and prosthetists, educators, and rehabilitation and health professionals.

==Assistive technology products==
===Personal Emergency Response Systems===
[[Image:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a manual dexterity disability is making choices on a touchscreen with a head dauber.]] 
Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS), or [[Telecare]] (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.

Technology similar to PERS can also be used to act within a person's home rather than just to respond to a detected crisis. Using one of the examples above, gas sensors for people with dementia can be used to trigger a device that turns off the gas and tells someone what has happened.

Designing for people with dementia is a good example of how the design of the interface of a piece of AT is critical to its usefulness.  People with dementia or any other identified user group must be involved in the design process to make sure that the design is accessible and usable. In the example above, a voice message could be used to remind the person with dementia to turn off the gas himself, but whose voice should be used, and what should the message say? Questions like these must be answered through user consultation, involvement and evaluation.

===Accessible computer input===
[[Image:Sip-and-puff device.jpg|thumb|This is a sip-and-puff device which allows a person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations.]] 
Sitting at a desk with a [[QWERTY keyboard]] and a mouse remains the dominant way of interacting with a personal computer. Some Assistive Technology reduces the strain of this way of work through [[Ergonomics|ergonomic accessories]] with height-adjustable furniture, footrests, wrist rests, and arm supports to ensure correct posture. Key guards fit over the keyboard to help prevent unintentional key presses.

Alternatively, Assistive Technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves:
* Ergonomic keyboards reduce the discomfort and strain of typing.
* [[Chorded keyboard]]s have a handful of keys (one per digit per hand) to type by 'chords' which produce different letters and keys.
* Expanded keyboards with larger, more widely spaced keys.
* Compact and miniature keyboards.
* [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] and other alternative layouts may offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chubon, R.A., Hester, M.R. |title=An enhanced standard computer keyboard system for single-finger and typing-stick typing |journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=17–24 |year=1988 |pmid=2973523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anson, D., George, S., Galup, R., Shea, B., Vetter, R. |title=Efficiency of the Chubon versus the QWERTY keyboard |journal=Assistive-Technology |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=40–5 |year=2001 |pmid=12212435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also variants of Dvorak in which the most common keys are located at either the left or right side of the keyboard.

Input devices may be modified to make them easier to see and understand:
* Keyboards with lowercase keys
* Keyboards with big keys.
* Keyboards with less and big keys, or multifunctional keys, such us the special keyboard PiTech, with only five big rounded keys, which is used with a special software for writing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitech.com.ar PiTech]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Large print keyboard with high contrast colors (such as white on black, black on white, and black on ivory).
* Large print adhesive keyboard stickers in high contrast colors (such as white on black, black on white, and black on yellow).
* Embossed locator dots help find the 'home' keys, F and J, on the keyboard.
* Scroll wheels on mice remove the need to locate the scrolling interface on the computer screen.
* [[Footmouse]] — Foot-operated mouse.

More ambitiously, and quite crucially when keyboard or mouse prove unusable, AT can also replace the keyboard and mouse with alternative devices such as the [[LOMAK]] keyboard, [[trackball]]s, [[joysticks]], [[graphics tablet]]s, [[touchpad]]s, [[touch screens]], [[Footmouse|foot mice]], a microphone with [[speech recognition]] software, [[sip-and-puff]] input, [[switch access]], and [[vision-based input devices]], such as [[eye tracker]]s which allow the user to control the mouse with their eyes.

Software can also make input devices easier to use:

* [[Keyboard shortcuts]] and [[MouseKeys]] allow the user to substitute keyboarding for mouse actions. [[Macro recorder]]s can greatly extend the range and sophistication of keyboard shortcuts.
* [[Sticky keys]] allows characters or commands to be typed without having to hold down a modifier key (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) while pressing a second key. Similarly, [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/clicklock.aspx ClickLock] is a [[Microsoft Windows]] feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down throughout.
* Customization of mouse or mouse alternatives' responsiveness to movement, double-clicking, and so forth.
* [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/togglekeys.aspx ToggleKeys] is a feature of [[Microsoft Windows]] 95 onwards. A high sound is heard when the CAPS LOCK, SCROLL LOCK, or NUM LOCK key is switched on and a low sound is heard when any of those keys are switched off.
* Customization of pointer appearance, such as size, color and shape.
* [[Predictive text]]
* [[Spell checker]]s and [[grammar checker]]s

===Durable Medical Equipment (DME)===
* Seating products that assist people to sit comfortably and safely (seating systems, cushions, therapeutic seats).
* Standing products to support people with disabilities in the standing position while maintaining/improving their health ([[standing frame]], [[standing wheelchair]], active stander).
* Walking products to aid people with disabilities who are able to walk or stand with assistance (canes, crutches, walkers, gait trainers).
* Advanced technology walking products to aid people with disabilities, such as paraplegia or cerebral palsy, who would not at all able to walk or stand (exoskeletons).
* Wheeled mobility products that enable people with reduced mobility to move freely indoors and outdoors (wheelchairs/scooters)
* Vehicles modified with [[Height adjustable suspension]], to allow wheelchair entry to the vehicle
* Robot-aided rehabilitation is a sensory-motor rehabilitation technique based on the use of robots and mechatronic devices {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)===
[[Augmentative and alternative communication]] is a well defined specialty within Assistive Technology. It involves ways of communication that either enhance or replace verbal language. 
AAC devices vary widely with respect to their technological sophistication:

* Low-tech systems. Simple paper or object based systems, i.e. do not require a battery (e.g., Talking Mats, Dry Erase Boards, Clipboards, 3-Ring Binders, Manila File Folders, Photo Albums, Laminated PCS/Photographs, Highlight tape).
* Light-tech systems. Typically consisting of a digitized speech recorder with a touch-sensitive display pad and sometimes switch access. Lite-tech systems require a battery (e.g., Tape Recorder, Language Master, Overhead Projector, Timers, Calculators).
* High-tech systems. Computerized VOCAs that vary from single purpose appliance-like systems to multipurpose computer-based communication aids. Typically high-tech systems require training and ongoing support to operate the devices (e.g., Video Cameras, Computers and Adaptive Hardware, Complex Voice Output Devices).


When combined with Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) teaching methods{{citation_needed|date=October 2010}}, AAC has improved communication skills in children with Autism.

''Claims''
Since children with autism process visual information easier than auditory information, when utilizing assistive technology claims that any time we use these devices with these children, we're giving them information through their strongest processing area (visual). Therefore various types of technology from &quot;low&quot; tech to &quot;high&quot; tech, should be incorporated into every aspect of daily living in order to improve the functional capabilities of children with autism.

''Benefits''
Regarding comprehension skills, increasing comprehension of tasks/activities/situations is essential in addressing skill areas such as organization, attending, self help, following directions, following rules and modifying behavior. As a result, the child becomes more independent. The following &quot;low&quot; tech visual support strategies can be created and used to benefit and assist the child in increasing his comprehension skills and thus decreasing the occurrence of challenging behaviors.

Consistent daily use of an individualized visual schedule will increase a child's organization skills and independent functioning throughout all aspects of his life and will ease transition through adulthood. There are numerous ways to present visual schedules for example an object schedule, 3-ring binder schedule, clipboard schedule, manila file folder schedules, and dry erase board schedules are all beneficial to increase a child's organization skills and independent functioning.

The use of a weekly/monthly calendar at both home and school can provide the child with important information regarding up-coming events/activities, rather than relying on auditory information. When the child asks when a particular event will occur, he can easily be referred to the visual calendar. Use of a visual calendar can also be helpful in assisting the child to understand when regularly scheduled events may not occur.

''Outcomes''
In a pilot study, Researchers Lacava, Golan, Baron-Cohen, and Myles explored the use of assistive technology to teach emotion recognition to eight children with Autism and the results indicated that after intervention, participants improved on face and voice emotional recognition for basic and complex emotions that were in the software. As well as for complex voice emotional recognition for emotions not included in Mind Reading.

[[File:Boulier1.JPG|right|thumb|A Chinese abacus]]
[[File:Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica, 1508 (1230x1615).png|right|thumb|250px|'''Calculating-Table by Gregor Reisch: Margarita Philosophica, 1508'''. The woodcut shows ''Arithmetica'' instructing an [[algorism|algorist]] and an abacist (inaccurately represented as [[Boethius]] and [[Pythagoras]]).  There was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' into Europe in the 12th century until its triumph in the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Carl B. Boyer, ''A History of Mathematics'', pp252-253, Wiley, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''abacus''', also called a '''counting frame''', is a calculating tool used primarily in parts of Asia for performing [[arithmetic]] processes. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal. The abacus was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and elsewhere. The user of an abacus is called an abacist.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;abacist&quot;, &quot;abacus&quot;, in Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged, 2000, Version 2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from Άβακός ''abakos'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of Άβαξ ''abax'' (&quot;calculating-table&quot;), from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ābāq'' (אבק), &quot;dust&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=abacus|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2009-09-19|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred plural of ''abacus'' is a subject of disagreement, with both ''abacuses''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-OED-abacus|Oxford English Dictionary 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''abaci''&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMish2003|Merriam-Webster's 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; in use.

==Mesopotamian abacus==
The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[Sumer]]ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars point to a character from the Babylonian [[cuneiform]] which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Crump|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of Carruccio (and other Old Babylonian scholars) that [http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/chronology.html Old] [[Babylon]]ians &quot;may have used the abacus for the operations of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Carruccio|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egyptian abacus==
The use of the abacus in [[Ancient Egypt]] is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered,&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Smith|1958|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting some doubt over the extent to which this instrument was used.{{Or|date=December 2010}}

==Persian abacus==
During the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/westasia/science/math.htm West Asian Mathematics - History for Kids!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanian]] [[Iran]]ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions by the countries around them – [[India]], [[China]], and the [[Roman Empire]], when it is thought to be expanded over the other countries.

==Greek abacus==
The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1846 AD dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble {{convert|149|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|4.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.

==Roman abacus==
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Copy of a Roman Abacus]]

The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles, [[calculi]], were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Pullan, page18&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century &lt;ref&gt;Nancy Marie Brown, &quot;The Abacus and the Cross: The Story of the Pope Who Brought the Light of Science to the Dark Ages&quot;; see a presentation at http://www.religiondispatches.org/books/rd10q/3878/everything_you_think_you_know_about_the_dark_ages_is_wrong/&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman ounces.

==Chinese abacus==
{{Main|Suanpan}}
[[File:abacus 6.png|thumb|Suanpan (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese abacus, known as the ''suànpán'' (算盤, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), is typically {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both [[decimal]] and [[hexadecimal]] computation. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryerson&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.ee.ryerson.ca:8080/~elf/abacus/intro.html |title=A Brief Introduction to the Abacus |author=Fernandes, Luis |date=November 27, 2003 |work=ee.ryerson.ca |publisher= |accessdate=2009-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.

Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.

In the famous long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145 AD) during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1297 AD), a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).

The similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2, allowing use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system. Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.

==Indian abacus==
First century sources, such as the ''[[Abhidharmakosa]]'' describe the knowledge and use of abacus in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Körner|Langer|1996|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu texts used the term ''shunya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Mollin|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese abacus==
{{Main|Soroban}}
[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Japanese soroban]]
In Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|算盤, そろばん}}, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), imported from China around 1600.&lt;ref name=&quot;fernandes&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/abacus/history.html | title = The Abacus: A Brief History | first = Luis | last = Fernandes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban can arrive at the answer in the same time (or faster) as obtainable with a physical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0720/072033.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean abacus==
The Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;[http://www.thocp.net/hardware/abacus.html Abacusmiddle ages, region of origin Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans call it ''jupan'' (주판), ''supan'' (수판) or ''jusan'' (주산).&lt;ref&gt;[http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b19j3727a 주판 : Daum 백과사전&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture. This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inaoep.mx/iberamia2004/nepo_eng.htm Nepohualtzintzin] The Pre Hispanic Computer&lt;/ref&gt;
The word Nepohualtzintzin comes from the Nahuatl and it is formed by the roots; Ne - personal -; pohual or pohualli - the account -; and tzintzin - small similar elements. And its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the &quot;Kalmekak&quot; to the &quot;temalpouhkeh&quot;, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood. Unfortunately the Nepohualtzintzin and its teaching were among the victims of the conquering destruction, when a diabolic origin was attributed to them after observing the tremendous properties of representation, precision and speed of calculations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

This arithmetic tool was based on the [[vigesimal]] system (base 20).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/java/AbacusAppMA.html MesoAmerican Abacus]&lt;/ref&gt; For the aztec the count by 20s was completely natural. The amount of 4, 5, 13, 20 and other cyclees meant cycles.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} The Nepohualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.

Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepohualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepohualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepohualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepohualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepohualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1 1/4 days short). It is worth mentioning that the Nepohualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed, when translated into modern computer arithmetic.

The rediscovery of the Nepohualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;David Esparza Hidalgo, ''Nepohualtzintzin. Computador Prehispanico en Vigencia'' [The Nepohualtzintzin: a pre-Hispanic computer in use] (Mexico City, Mexico: Editorial Diana, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. There have also been found very old Nepohualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]]a culture, and even some bracelets of Mayan origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.

George I. Sanchez, &quot;Arithmetic in Maya&quot;, Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the Yucatán that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0 1,2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand used 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning an end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]] a noted Mayanist.  

The [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data, like advanced [[tally stick]]s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for &quot;counting tool&quot;; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quipus.it/english/Andean%20Calculators.pdf Andean Calculators], Antonio Aimi, Nicolino De Pasquale(translated by Franca Del Bianco)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian abacus==
[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four beads, for quarter-ruble fractions. This wire is usually near the user). (Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916.) The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different colour from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bud, Deborah Jean Warner (eds.), ''Instruments of science: an historical encyclopedia'', p7, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998 ISBN 0815315619.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Hudgins, ''The Other Side of Russia'', p219, Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004 ISBN 1585444049.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Leushina, ''The development of elementary mathematical concepts in preschool children‎'', p427, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1991 ISBN 0873532996&lt;/ref&gt; Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Calculator#Pocket_calculators|microcalculator]]s had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.

The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Trogemann, Alexander Y. Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, ''Computing in Russia: The History of Computer Devices and Information Technology Revealed'', p24, Vieweg+Teubner Verlag, 2001 ISBN 3528057572.&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Flegg, ''Numbers: Their History and Meaning'', p72, Courier Dover Publications, 2002 ISBN 0486421651.&lt;/ref&gt;

==School abacus==
[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|left|150px|thumb|School abacus used in Danish elementary school. Early 19th century.]]
Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the [[numeral system]] and [[arithmetic]].

In Western countries, a '''bead frame''' similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

The type of abacus shown here is often used to represent numbers without the use of place value. Each bead and each wire has the same value and used in this way it can represent numbers up to 100.

==Uses by the blind==
An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]]. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cubic root]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.aph.org/tests/abacus.html|author=Terlau, Terrie|coauthors=Gissoni, Fred|title=Abacus: Position Paper|publisher=APH.org|date=July 20, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth code]] (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot; /&gt;

==Binary Abacus==
[[File:Bbinary Abacus 002.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Two binary abaci constructed by Dr. Robert C. Good, Jr., made from two Chinese abaci]]
The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Good, Jr., [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ333511 &quot;The binary abacus: a useful tool for explaining computer operations&quot;], ''Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching'', '''vol.5''', Iss.1 (Fall 1985), pp.34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer, or via [[ASCII]]. The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows. The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an 'on' or 'off' position.

{{Acids and Bases}}
[[File:Zn reaction with HCl.JPG|thumb|[[Zinc]], a typical metal, reacting with [[hydrochloric acid]], a typical acid]]
An '''acid''' (from the [[Latin]] ''acidus/acēre'' meaning ''sour''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a substance which reacts with a [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. Commonly, acids can be identified as tasting sour, reacting with metals such as [[calcium]], and bases like [[sodium carbonate]]. Aqueous acids have a pH of less than 7, where an acid of lower pH is typically stronger, and turn blue [[litmus|litmus paper]] red. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.

Common examples of acids include [[acetic acid]] (in [[vinegar]]), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[tartaric acid]] (used in baking). As these three examples show, acids can be [[solutions]], [[liquids]], or [[solids]]. Gases such as [[hydrogen chloride]] can be acids as well. Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].

There are three common definitions for acids: the Arrhenius definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition, and the Lewis definition. The Arrhenius definition states that acids are substances which increase the concentration of [[hydronium]] ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in solution. The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor. Most acids encountered in everyday life are [[aqueous solutions]], or can be dissolved in water, and these two definitions are most relevant. The reason why pHs of acids are less than 7 is that the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have pHs of less than 7. By the Brønsted-Lowry definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid. Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.

In chemistry, the Lewis definition of acidity is frequently encountered. Lewis acids are electron-pair acceptors. Examples of Lewis acids include all metal [[ion|cations]], and electron-deficient molecules such as [[boron trifluoride]] and [[aluminium trichloride]]. Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids as mentioned above, they can also function as [[Lewis base]]s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

==Definitions and concepts==
{{main|Acid–base reaction}}
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.

===Arrhenius acids===
The Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] attributed the properties of acidity to [[hydrogen]] in 1884. An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that increases the concentration of the [[hydronium ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, when dissolved in water. This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and [[hydroxide ion|hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot;&gt;Ebbing, D.D., &amp; Gammon, S. D. (2005). ''General chemistry'' (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-618-51177-6&lt;/ref&gt;
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
In pure water the majority of molecules exist as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but a small number of molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating. Pure water is neutral with respect to acidity or basicity because the concentration of hydroxide ions is always equal to the concentration of hydronium ions. An Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]] is a molecule which increases the concentration of the hydroxide ion when dissolved in water. Note that chemists often write H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') and refer to the [[hydrogen ion]] when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a [[proton]], does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Brønsted-Lowry acids===
While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Brønsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives [[vinegar]] its characteristic taste:
:[[File:Acid-base.png]]
Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but cannot be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe [[molecule|molecular compounds]], whereas Arrhenius acids must be [[ion|ionic compounds]]. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:
# H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
# HCl(''benzene'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''benzene'') → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(''s'')
# HCl(''g'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(''s'')
As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; combine to form the solid.

===Lewis acids===
A third concept was proposed by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. All [[Brønsted acid]]s are also [[Lewis acid]]s, but not all Lewis acids are Brønsted acids. Contrast the following reactions which could be described in terms of acid-base chemistry.

In the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride &quot;loses&quot; a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[oxidizing agents|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]].

The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from an acid to a base.

==Dissociation and equilibrium==
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, where HA represents the acid and A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton ([[protonation]] and [[deprotonation]], respectively). Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] means ''the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[\mbox{H}^+] [\mbox{A}^-]}{[\mbox{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;
The stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is more frequently used, where p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; at 25°C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.

==Nomenclature==
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below. 
For example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form [[hydrochloric acid]]. In the [[IUPAC]] naming system, &quot;aqueous&quot; is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix &quot;hydro-&quot; is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.

Classical naming system:

==Acid strength==
The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and one mole of the conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.

Stronger acids have a larger ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and a more negative p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids.

Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.

[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] &quot;salts&quot;. They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.

===Polarity and the inductive effect===
Polarity refers to the distribution of electrons in a [[chemical bond|bond]], the region of space between two atomic nuclei where a pair of electrons is shared. When two atoms have roughly the same [[electronegativity]] (ability to attract electrons) the electrons are shared evenly and spend equal time on either end of the bond. When there is a significant difference in electronegativities of two bonded atoms, the electrons spend more time near the nucleus of the more electronegative element and an electrical dipole, or separation of charges, occurs, such that there is a partial negative charge localized on the electronegative element and a partial positive charge on the electropositive element. Hydrogen is an electropositive element and accumulates a slightly positive charge when it is bonded to an electronegative element such as [[oxygen]] or [[bromine]]. As the [[electron density]] on hydrogen decreases it is more easily abstracted, in other words, it is more acidic. Moving from left to right across a row on the [[periodic table]] elements become more electronegative (excluding the [[noble gases]]), and the strength of the [[binary acid]] formed by the element increases accordingly:

The electronegative element need not be directly bonded to the acidic hydrogen to increase its acidity. An electronegative atom can pull electron density out of an acidic bond through the [[inductive effect]]. The electron-withdrawing ability diminishes quickly as the electronegative atom moves away from the acidic bond. The effect is illustrated by the following series of [[halogenated]] [[butanoic acid]]s. [[Chlorine]] is more electronegative than [[bromine]] and therefore has a stronger effect. The hydrogen atom bonded to the oxygen is the acidic hydrogen. Butanoic acid is a [[carboxylic acid]].

As the chlorine atom moves further away from the acidic O—H bond, its effect diminishes. When the chlorine atom is just one carbon removed from the carboxylic acid group the acidity of the compound increases significantly, compared to butanoic acid (a.k.a. [[butyric acid]]). However, when the chlorine atom is separated by several bonds the effect is much smaller. Bromine is much more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen, but not as electronegative as chlorine, so the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 2-bromobutanoic acid is slightly greater than the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 2-chlorobutanoic acid.

[[Image:Perchloricacid.png|thumb|left|[[Perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[oxoacid]] and a [[strong acid]].]]The number of electronegative atoms adjacent an acidic bond also affects acid strength. [[Oxoacid]]s have the general formula HOX where X can be any atom and may or may not share bonds to other atoms. Increasing the number of electronegative atoms or groups on atom X decreases the electron density in the acidic bond, making the loss of the proton easier. Perchloric acid is a very strong acid (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ -8) and completely dissociates in water. Its chemical formula is HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and it comprises a central [[chlorine]] atom with three chlorine-oxygen double bonds (Cl=O) and one chlorine-oxygen single bond (Cl—O). The singly bonded oxygen bears an extremely acidic hydrogen atom which is easily abstracted. In contrast, [[chloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a weaker acid, though still quite strong (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.0), while [[chlorous acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = +2.0) and [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = +7.53) acids are weak acids.&lt;ref&gt;pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values for HClO&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from {{Housecroft2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Carboxylic acid]]s are [[organic acid]]s that contain an acidic [[hydroxyl group]] and a [[carbonyl]] (C=O bond). Carboxylic acids can be [[redox|reduced]] to the corresponding alcohol; the replacement of an electronegative oxygen atom with two electropositive hydrogens yields a product which is essentially non-acidic. The reduction of [[acetic acid]] to [[ethanol]] using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[lithium aluminium hydride]] or LAH) and [[diethyl ether|ether]] is an example of such a reaction.
:[[File:Reduction.png]]
The p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for ethanol is 16, compared to 4.76 for acetic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evanspka&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pkatables&quot;&gt;[http://research.chem.psu.edu/brpgroup/pKa_compilation.pdf pKa Data Compiled by R. Williams]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic radius and bond strength===
Another factor that contributes to the ability of an acid to lose a proton is the strength of the [[chemical bond|bond]] between the acidic hydrogen and the atom that bears it. This, in turn, is dependent on the size of the atoms sharing the bond. For an acid HA, as the size of atom A increases, the strength of the bond decreases, meaning that it is more easily broken, and the strength of the acid increases. Bond strength is a measure of how much [[bond energy|energy]] it takes to break a bond. In other words, it takes less energy to break the bond as atom A grows larger, and the proton is more easily removed by a base. This partially explains why hydrofluoric acid is considered a weak acid while the other hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr, HI) are strong acids. Although fluorine is more electronegative than the other halogens, its [[atomic radius]] is also much smaller, so it shares a stronger bond with hydrogen. Moving down a column on the periodic table atoms become less electronegative but also significantly larger, and the size of the atom tends to dominate its acidity when sharing a bond to hydrogen. [[Hydrogen sulfide]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, is a stronger acid than water, even though oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. Just as with the halogens, this is because sulfur is larger than oxygen and the H—S bond is more easily broken than the H—O bond.

==Chemical characteristics==
===Monoprotic acids===
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):

:::::HA(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;

Common examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH).
{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}

===Polyprotic acids===
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate). 

A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), for which ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), wherein the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; is intermediate strength. The large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;). Both ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are small, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .

A triprotic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;

An [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, then HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, and finally PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion. Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.

Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''α'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A, HA&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and A&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{H_2 A}={{[H^+]^2} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[H_2 A]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{HA^- }={{[H^+]K_1} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[HA^-]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{A^{2-}}={{K_1 K_2} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[A^{2-} ]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[H^+ ]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \over { \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^n \Big[ [H^+ ]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \Big] }

&lt;/math&gt;
where K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.

===Neutralization===
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]
[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water:

::HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) + NaCl(aq)

Neutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.

Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].

===Weak acid/weak base equilibria===
{{main|Henderson–Hasselbalch equation}}
In order to lose a proton, it is necessary that the pH of the system rise above the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the protonated acid. The decreased concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form, or to protonate its conjugate base (the deprotonated form).

Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.

==Applications of acids==
There are numerous uses for acids. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as [[pickling (metal)|pickling]]. They may be used as an electrolyte in a [[wet cell battery]], such as [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[car battery]].

Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing. For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.

In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts. For example, [[nitric acid]] reacts with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium nitrate]], a fertilizer. Additionally, [[carboxylic acid]]s can be [[Esterification|esterified]] with [[alcohol]]s, to produce [[ester]]s.

Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. [[Phosphoric acid]], for example, is a component of [[cola]] drinks. Acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar. Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.
Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.

[[Tartaric acid]] is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. [[Citric acid]] is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. [[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.

[[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin required in our body and is present in such foods as amla, lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.

Certain acids are used as drugs. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.

Acids play very important roles in the human body. The hydrochloric acid present in our stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of our body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA, RNA and transmission of characters to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.

===Acid catalysis===
{{Main|Acid catalysis}}
Acids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] and [[condensation reaction]]s.  In biochemistry, many [[enzyme]]s employ acid catalysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet acid cat&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Voet, Judith G.; Voet, Donald |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J.

==Biological occurrence==
[[Image:Aminoacid.png|thumb|left|Basic structure of an [[amino acid]].]]Many biologically important molecules are acids. [[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].  Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].

An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or ''alpha'' carbon) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality_(chemistry)#By_configuration:_D-_and_L-|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some [[bacteria]]l [[cell wall]]s contains some &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and the basic amine group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gains a proton (-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains.  [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of -1 at physiological pH.

Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] &quot;head&quot; groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.

In humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].

Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]], releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breath faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and resupplying the cells with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.

'''Asphalt''' {{IPA-en|ˈæsfɔːlt||en-us-asphalt.ogg}} is a sticky, black and highly [[viscosity|viscous]] liquid or semi-solid that is present in most crude [[petroleum]]s and in some natural deposits. Until the 20th century, the term '''asphaltum''' was also used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Herbert|last=Abraham|year=1938| title=Asphalts and Allied Substances: Their Occurrence, Modes of Production, Uses in the Arts, and Methods of Testing | edition=4th| publisher=D.

In [[American English]], asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils. Outside the U.S., the product is often called [[bitumen]]. Natural deposits terminology also sometimes uses the word bitumen, such as at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].

The primary use of asphalt is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] particles to create [[asphalt concrete]].

==Etymology==
The word ''asphalt'' is derived from the late Middle English : from French ''asphalte'', based on [[Late Latin]] ''asphalton'', ''asphaltum'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄσφαλτος (''ásphaltos'', ''ásphalton''), a word meaning &quot;asphalt/[[bitumen]]/[[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]&quot; which some derive from α- &quot;without&quot; and σφάλλω, (''sfallō''), &quot;to make fall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Liddell| first= Henry George| title= A Greek-English Lexicon
| url=http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:5:73.lsj| accessdate = 2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that in French, the term ''asphalte'' is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the &quot;asphaltic concrete&quot; used to pave roads.
Another description has it that the term derives from the Accadian term ''asphaltu'' or ''sphallo'', meaning &quot;to split.&quot; It was later adopted from the Homeric Greeks as a verb meaning &quot;to make firm or stable,&quot; &quot;to secure&quot;.{{fact|date=February 2011}} It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (&quot;asphalte&quot;) and English (&quot;asphaltum&quot; and &quot;asphalt&quot;). The expression &quot;bitumen&quot; originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words &quot;jatu,&quot; meaning &quot;pitch,&quot; and &quot;jatu-krit,&quot; meaning &quot;pitch creating,&quot; &quot;pitch producing&quot; (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally 'gwitu-men' (pertaining to pitch), and by others, &quot;pixtumens&quot; (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to &quot;bitumen,&quot; thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word &quot;cwidu&quot; (Mastix), the German word &quot;Kitt&quot; (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word &quot;kvada&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham19381&quot;&gt;Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern usage ===
In [[British English]], the word 'asphalt' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and bitumen (or [[tarmac]] in common parlance). The earlier word 'asphaltum' is now archaic and not commonly used. In [[American English]], 'asphalt' is equivalent to the British 'bitumen'. However, 'asphalt' is also commonly used as a shortened form of '[[asphalt concrete]]' (therefore equivalent to the British 'asphalt' or 'tarmac'). In [[Australian English]], bitumen is sometimes used as the generic term for road surfaces. In [[Canadian English]], the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy [[crude oil]] known also as 'oil sands' or [[tar sands]].,&lt;ref name=oilsands&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; while asphalt is used for the [[oil refinery]] product used to pave roads and manufacture [[roof shingle]]s.
Diluted bitumen (diluted with [[naphtha]] to make it flow in pipelines) is known as [[dilbit]] in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen &quot;[[Upgrader|upgraded]]&quot; to [[synthetic crude]] oil is known as [[syncrude]] and syncrude blended with bitumen as ''synbit''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPP&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
[[File:recapeamento.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Asphalt concrete]] in use for resurfacing of Francisco Delandes Avenue, in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].]]
[[File:Asfalto em poá - são paulo - brasil.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Asphalt concrete]] being used to pave a street in [[Poá]] - [[SP]] - [[Brazil]].]]

Asphalt or bitumen can sometimes be confused with [[tar]], which is a similar black thermo-plastic material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[coal]]. During the early- and mid-20th century when [[town gas]] was produced, tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to [[macadam]] roads led to the word [[tarmac]], which is now used in common parlance to refer to road making materials. However, since the 1970s, when [[natural gas]] succeeded town gas, asphalt (bitumen) has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and the Canadian [[Tar Sands]]. ''Pitch'' is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in [[Pitch Lake]].

Natural deposits of asphalt include lake asphalts (primarily from the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Lake Bermudez]] in [[Venezuela]]), [[Gilsonite]], the [[Dead Sea]], ''bituminous rock'' and [[Tar Sands]]. Asphalt was mined at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in [[Ritchie County, West Virginia]] in the United States from 1852 to 1873. Bituminous rock was mined at many locations in the United States for use as a paving material, primarily during the late 1800s. 

Asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) by the process of [[fractional distillation]], usually under [[vacuum]] conditions. A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a [[de-asphalting unit]], which uses either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated. Further processing is possible by &quot;blowing&quot; the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This makes the product harder and more viscous.

Asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 degrees Celsius (300 °F).  Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called '''bitumen feedstock''', or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm.  The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is sometimes used as a [[release agent]], although it can mix with and thereby reduce the quality of the asphalt.

==Known uses==
===Ancient times===
In the ancient [[Middle East]], natural asphalt deposits were used for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship [[caulking]], and for waterproofing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot; /&gt; The [[Persian language|Persian]] word for asphalt is ''moom'', which is related to the English word [[mummy]]; asphalt was used by [[ancient Egypt]]ians to [[embalm]] mummies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pringle, Heather Anne |title=The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |location=New York, NY |year=2001 |pages= 196–197|isbn=0-7607-7151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the ancient [[Far East]], natural asphalt was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects, became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot; /&gt; such as [[scabbard]]s and other items. Statuettes of household [[deities]] were also cast with this type of material in [[Japan]], and probably also in [[China]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In [[North America]], archaeological recovery has indicated that asphalt was sometimes used to adhere stone [[projectile point]]s to a wooden shaft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Morro Creek'', ed. by A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1838 edition of ''Mechanics Magazine'' cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by &quot;a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel&quot;, and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways - &quot;principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusin of dirt and filth&quot;, which at that time made the water unusable. &quot;He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces&quot; in palaces, &quot;the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MechanicsMagazineSep1838176&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=|last=|year=1838| month=April 7th-29th September | title=The Mechanic's magazine, museum, register, journal and gazette| volume=29|chapter=Nothing New under the Sun (on French asphaltum use in 1621)| publisher=W.A.

Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used &quot;for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes&quot;. Its rise in Europe was &quot;a sudden phenomenon&quot;, after natural deposits were found &quot;in France at Osbann ([[Bas-Rhin|BasRhin]]), the Parc (l'Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix ([[Puy-de-Dôme|Puy-de-Dome]])&quot;, although it could also be made artificially.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMiles&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Miles, Lewis |title=in Australian Building: A Cultural Investigation |volume=|chapter=Section 10.6: Damp Proofing|year=2000 | publisher= | location=|page=10.06.1| url=http://www.mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/climatic-design/climatic-design-damp-proofing.pdf|accessdate=2009-11-11}}.

Among the earlier uses of asphalt in the United Kingdom, was for etching. William Salmon's ''Polygraphice'' (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], and one ounce of asphaltum.&lt;ref name=&quot;SalmonPolygraphice&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Salmon|year=1673|publisher=R.

Indeed in 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMiles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard1908&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=W.M.

=== Early use in the United States ===
The first use of asphaltum in the New World was by indigenous peoples.  On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash]] peoples collected the naturally occurring asphaltum that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits.  All three used the substance as an adhesive.  It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on [[rattle (percussion)|rattle]]s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles.  It was also used in decorations.  Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations.  It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them water tight for carrying water.  Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.  

Roads in the US have been paved with asphalt since at least 1870, when a street in front of Newark, NJ's City Hall was paved.  In 1876, asphalt was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAPA2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan |last=McNichol|year=2005| month=| title=Paving the Way: Asphalt in America| edition=|editor= |chapter=| publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association| location=Lanham, MD |pages= |url=http://store.hotmix.org/index.php?productID=144|isbn=0-914313-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asphalt was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard1908&quot; /&gt;


=== Rolled asphalt concrete ===
The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the [[United States]]. Asphalt pavement material is commonly composed of 5 percent asphalt cement and 95 percent aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so that it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant. There are about 4,000 asphalt mixing plants in the U.S. 

Asphalt road surface is the most widely recycled material in the US, both by gross tonnage and by percentage.  According to a report issued by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], 80% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new roads, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.

[[Asphalt shingle|Roofing shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.

Asphalt is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.

=== Mastic asphalt ===
[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher bitumen ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt, which has only around 5% added bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground.  Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{C to F|210}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about {{mm to in|20}} thick.

=== Asphalt emulsion ===
A number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing the asphalt with petroleum solvents to form &quot;cutbacks&quot; with reduced melting point or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry Seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low cost pavements.

==Alternatives and bioasphalt ==
{{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}

Certain activist groups have become increasingly concerned about the global [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]] problem in recent years due to by-products that are released into the atmosphere. Most of the emissions are derived primarily from burning [[fossil fuel]]s. This has led to the introduction of petroleum [[bitumen]] alternatives that are more environmentally friendly and non-toxic.

The '''American National Standards Institute''' ('''ANSI''', {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|n|s|iː}} {{respell|AN|see}}) is a private [[non-profit organization]] that oversees the development of [[Standardization|voluntary consensus standards]] for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. The organization also coordinates [[United States|U.S.]] standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.  For example, standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe. 

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of standards developing organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 2009 Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's headquarters are in [[Washington, DC]]. ANSI's operations office is located in [[New York City]]. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.

== History ==
ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). In 1928, the AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). The present name was adopted in 1969.

Prior to 1918, these five engineering societies:
*[[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE, now [[IEEE]])
*[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME)
*[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE)
*American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers]])
*American Society for Testing and Materials (now [[ASTM International]])
had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES).
At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy and Commerce to join in founding a national standards organization.

According to Paul G. Agnew, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else.  Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME.  An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.

In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iec.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
ANSI's membership comprises government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.&lt;ref name=&quot;membership&quot;&gt;ANSI membership page, [http://www.ansi.org/membership/overview/overview.aspx?menuid=2www.ansi.org/membership www.ansi.org/membership]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Though ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute's requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.

ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/Documents/News%20and%20Publications/Brochures/Value%20of%20the%20ANS.pdf  ''Value of the ANS Designation'' brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.

The American National Standards process involves:
*consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties
*broad-based public review and comment on draft standards
*consideration of and response to comments
*incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard
*availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.

==International activities==
In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the U.S., ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.

The Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.

===Standards panels===
The Institute administers five standards panels:
*The ANSI Biofuels Standards Panel (ANSI-BSP)
*The [[Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel]]
*The ANSI Homeland Security Standards Panel
*The ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel
*The Identity Theft Prevention and Identity Management Standards Panel

Each of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas. 

In 2009, ANSI and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry. 

===American national standards===
*The ASA (American Standards Association) photographic exposure system became the basis for the ISO [[film speed]] system, currently used worldwide (ISO 5800:1987).
*A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers.  The ANSI code standard extended the previously created [[ASCII]] seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] or EBCDIC).  In [[Microsoft Windows]], the phrase &quot;ANSI&quot; refers to the [[Windows code page|Windows ANSI code page]]s (even though they are not ANSI standards).&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;ms&quot; glossary&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/glossary.mspx Microsoft Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for [[ideographic language]]s are variable width. Since these characters are based on a draft of the [[ISO-8859]] series, some of Microsoft's symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.
*The first computer [[programming language]] standard was &quot;American Standard [[Fortran]]&quot; (informally known as &quot;FORTRAN 66&quot;), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.
*The original standard implementation of the programming language [[C (computer language)|C]] was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known [[ANSI C]].
*The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.
*The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.
*The ANSI/HI ([[Hydraulic Institute]]) standards used for pumps.
*The ANSI for [[eye protection]] is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear. This standard is commonly used for shop glasses, shooting glasses, and many other examples of protective eyewear.
*The [[Paper size#ANSI paper sizes|ANSI paper sizes]] (ANSI/ASME Y14.1).

===Other initiatives===
*In 2008 ANSI, in  partnership&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Citation Technologies]], created the first dynamic, online web library for [[ISO 14000]] standards.&lt;ref name=iPackages&gt;[http://ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=1892 ANSI ISO 14000 Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On June 23, 2009 ANSI announced a product and services agreement with [[Citation Technologies]] to deliver all ISO Standards on a web-based platform. Through the ANSI-Citation partnership, 17,765 International Standards developed by more than 3,000 ISO technical bodies will be made available on the citation platform, arming subscribers with powerful search tools and collaboration, notification, and change-management functionality.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANSI Press Release 07.23.09&quot;&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=2261 ANSI Press Release 07.23.09]&lt;/ref&gt;
*ANSI, in partnership with [[Citation Technologies]], [[AAMI]], [[ASTM]], and [[DIN]], created a single, centralized database for medical device standards on September 9, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical Device Standards Press Release 09/09/09&quot;&gt;[http://astmnewsroom.org/default.aspx?pageid=1881 Medical Device Standards Database Press Release 09/09/09]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In early 2009, ANSI launched a new Certificate Accreditation Program (ANSI-CAP) to provide neutral, third-party attestation that a given certificate program meets the American National Standard ASTM E2659-09.
*In 2009, ANSI began accepting applications for certification bodies seeking accreditation according to requirements defined under the Toy Safety Certification Program (TSCP) as the official third-party accreditor of TSCP’s product certification bodies.
*In 2006, ANSI launched [http://www.standardsportal.org/ www.StandardsPortal.org], an online resource for facilitating more open and efficient trade between international markets in the areas of standards, conformity assessment, and technical regulations. The site currently features content for China, India, and Korea, with additional countries and regions planned for future content.

'''Apollo 11''' was the [[spaceflight]] that landed the first humans on Earth's [[Moon]] on July 20, 1969 (20:17:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The mission, carried out by the [[United States]], is considered a major accomplishment in the history of exploration.

Launched from [[Florida]] on July 16, the fifth manned mission, and the third lunar mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]], was crewed by Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin, Jr]]. On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin landed in the [[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]] and on July 21 became the first humans to walk on the Moon. Their [[lunar module|landing craft]], ''Eagle'', spent 21 hours and 31 minutes on the lunar surface while Collins orbited above in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command ship]], ''Columbia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm NASA Apollo 11 Timeline].&lt;/ref&gt; The three astronauts returned to Earth with {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and landed in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on July 24.

Apollo 11 fulfilled U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon before the [[Soviet Union]] by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a 1961 [[Apollo program#Background|mission statement]] before the [[United States Congress]]: &quot;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |title=Man on the moon: Kennedy speech ignited the dream |work=CNN | first=Richard | last=Stenger | date=May 25, 2001 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five additional Apollo missions landed on the Moon from 1969 to 1972.

==Crew==

Each crewman of Apollo 11 had made a spaceflight before this mission, making it only the second all-veteran crew (the other being Apollo 10) in manned spaceflight history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4205/ch12-6.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: Setting the Stage |work=NASA |accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on [[Apollo 8]] but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by [[Jim Lovell]], his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew, but promoted to backup commander.

===Backup crew===
{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology      = Astronaut

|position3        = Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up         = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise, Jr]]
}}

In early 1969, Bill Anders accepted a job with the [[National Space Council]] effective in August 1969 and announced his retirement as an astronaut. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original [[Apollo 13]] CMP.&lt;ref&gt;Donald K.

After the crew of [[Apollo 10]] named their spacecraft ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'', assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] director [[George M. Low]] to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The [[Apollo Command Module|command module]] was named ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' for the feminine personification of the United States used traditionally in song and poetry. The [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] was named ''Eagle'' for the [[national bird]] of the United States, the [[bald eagle]], which is featured prominently on the mission insignia. Backup commander Jim Lovell recommended the name ''Eagle'' for the lunar module. During early mission planning, the names ''Snowcone'' and ''Haystack'' were used but changed before announcement to the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snowcone&quot;&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700011707_1970011707.pdf|author=NASA|title=Technical information summary: Apollo 11 (AS-506) Apollo Saturn V space vehicle (TM-X-62812; S/E-ASTR-S-101-69)|format=PDF|date=June 25, 1969}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to throngs of people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information [[Jack King (NASA)|Jack King]] providing commentary. President [[Richard Nixon]] viewed the proceedings from the [[Oval Office]] of the White House.

A [[Saturn V]] launched ''Apollo 11'' from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on July 16, 1969 at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m. local time). It entered orbit 12 minutes later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orloff&quot; /&gt; After one and a half orbits, the [[S-IVB]] third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the [[Trans Lunar Injection]] burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command/service module]] pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the [[lunar module]] still nestled in the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Lunar Module Adaptor]]. After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the moon and into [[Heliocentric orbit|solar orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm|title=Apollo 11 Timeline|publisher=NASA|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, ''Apollo 11'' passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter [[lunar orbit]]. In the thirty orbits&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo-11/apollo-11.html Apollo-11] NASA.&lt;/ref&gt; that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility ([[Mare Tranquillitatis]]) about {{convert|20|km|mi}} southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ''[[Ranger 8]]'' and ''[[Surveyor 5]]'' landers along with the ''[[Lunar Orbiter]]'' mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-lib.ksc.nasa.gov/lib/archives/apollo/pk/apollo11pt1.pdf| title=Apollo 11 Press Kit (p.1-100) |format=PDF |author=NASA|date=July 6, 1969|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunar descent===
On July 20, 1969 the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) ''Eagle'' separated from the command module ''Columbia''. Collins, alone aboard ''Columbia'', inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface 4 seconds early and reported that they were &quot;long&quot;: they would land miles west of their target point.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} above the surface of the moon, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM navigation and guidance computer]] distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected &quot;1202&quot; and &quot;1201&quot; program alarms. Inside [[Johnson Space Center|Mission Control Center]] in Houston, Texas, computer engineer [[Jack Garman]] told [[Flight controller|guidance officer]] [[Steve Bales]] it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated &quot;executive overflows&quot;, where the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Collins, in [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html Apollo Expeditions to the Moon], NASA pub. no. SP-350 (1975), chapter [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-11-4.html 11.4].&lt;/ref&gt; During the mission the blame was placed on a switch being in the wrong position which meant that the computer was processing data from two radars instead of one. &lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo 11 Mission Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11_MissionReport.pdf|title=Apollo 11 Mission Report|format=PDF|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm|title=Tales from the Lunar Module Guidance Computer|author=Don Eyles|publisher=American Astronautical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; However an internal NASA report two years later concluded that the problem was the same peripheral hardware design bug that had been seen previously during Apollo 5 testing. &lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-fm.html|title=Apollo 11: 25 Years Later|author=Martin, Fred H.|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design flaw with the rendezvous radar meant that depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up a stationary antennae could appear to the computer to be dithering backwards and forwards between two adjacent positions. The
extra spurious [[cycle stealing]] as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter caused the computer to run slowly enough to cause the alarms.

When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300 meter diameter crater (later determined to be &quot;West crater&quot;, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control&lt;ref name=&quot;Digital Apollo&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author = Mindell, David A | title = Digital Apollo | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2008 | pages = 195–197 | isbn = 978-0-262-13497-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17 UTC on July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot;/&gt;

''Apollo 11'' landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts also encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to have been due to greater propellant 'slosh' than expected uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the {{convert|67|in|cm|0|adj=on}} probes hanging from ''Eagle'''s footpads had touched the surface, and he said &quot;Contact light!&quot;. Three seconds later, ''Eagle'' landed and Armstrong said &quot;Shutdown&quot;. Aldrin immediately said &quot;Okay, engine stop. ACA - out of [[detent]].&quot; Armstrong acknowledged &quot;Out of detent. Auto&quot; and Aldrin continued &quot;Mode control - both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm - off. 413 is in.&quot;

[[Charles Duke]], acting as CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying &quot;We copy you down, Eagle&quot;.

Armstrong continued with the remainder of the post landing checklist, &quot;Engine arm is off.&quot; before responding to Duke with the famous words, &quot;Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed.&quot; Armstrong's abrupt change of call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot; caused momentary confusion at Mission Control and Duke remained silent for a couple of seconds before expressing the relief of Mission Control: &quot;Roger, Twan-- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html | title = Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: The First Lunar Landing | author = Jones, Eric M.

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], Aldrin broadcast that:

{{quote|&quot;This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html | title = Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: Post-landing Activities | author = Jones, Eric M. (editor) | publisher = NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He then took [[Eucharist|Communion]] privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the ''[[Apollo 8]]'' crew reading from the [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Book of Genesis]]) which demanded that their astronauts refrain from religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning this. He had kept the plan quiet (not even mentioning it to his wife) and did not reveal it publicly for several years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
[[File:First Man on Moon 1969 Issue-10c.jpg|thumb|right|[[US space exploration history on US stamps|First Man on Moon Commemorative Issue of 1969]] ]]

Aldrin was an elder at Webster [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] in [[Webster, Texas]]. His communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of ''Guideposts'' magazine and in his book ''Return to Earth''. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon, and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaikin&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man on the Moon|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year =1998|pages=204 &amp; 623|isbn=0-14-027201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, since they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.

Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS). According to veteran moon-walker [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], a redesign of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from ''Apollo'' astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.summary.html|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal|author=Eric M.

At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21 (10:39pm EDT, Sunday July 20), 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC  began his descent to the Moon's surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56 UTC (10:56pm EDT)  he set his left foot on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html | title = Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: One Small Step | author = Jones, Eric M.

After describing the surface dust (&quot;fine and almost like a powder&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; Armstrong stepped off ''Eagle'''s footpad and into history as the first human to set foot on another astronomical body.

Armstrong said that moving in the Moon's gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was &quot;even perhaps easier than the simulations... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot;/&gt;

In addition to fulfilling President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/12303189849225-2/ &quot;Apollo 11: 1969 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apollo 11'' was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He then collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. He removed the TV camera from the MESA, made a panoramic sweep, and mounted it on a tripod {{convert|12|m|ft}} from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.

Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle'''s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Apollo AS11-40-5868.jpg|thumb|right|Using a [[70 mm film|70 mm]] camera, Armstrong photographs Buzz Aldrin stepping out of the lunar module.]]
[[File:Apollo 11 photo map.pdf|thumb|left|Map showing landing site and photos taken]]
After the astronauts planted a U.S. flag on the lunar surface, they spoke with President Richard Nixon through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called &quot;the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, ''[http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/apollo11.html Apollo 11 and Nixon]'', March 1996. Retrieved April 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but [[Frank Borman]], who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, out of respect of the lunar landing being Kennedy's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;This was related by [[Frank Borman]] during the 2008 documentary ''[[When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions]]'', part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a [[Lunar laser ranging experiment|laser ranging]] [[retroreflector]]. Then Armstrong loped about {{convert|120|m|ft}} from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater &lt;!-- There is no &quot;East Crater&quot;, see http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html --&gt; while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the [[geological hammer]] to pound in the tubes - the only time the hammer was used on ''Apollo 11''. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 min.

During this period Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: EASEP Deployment and Closeout|author=Jones, Eric M.

===Lunar ascent and return===
[[File:Aldrin with experiment.jpg|thumb|Aldrin stands next to the Passive Seismic Experiment Package with the [[Lunar Module]] in the background.]]

Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than {{convert|22|kg|lb}} of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one [[Hasselblad]] camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM, and settled down to sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 7&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html | title = Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: Trying to Rest | author = Jones, Eric M.

During this time another spacecraft, [[Luna 15]] — an unmanned Soviet spacecraft in lunar orbit, began its own descent to the lunar surface.  Launched only three days before the Apollo 11 mission, this was the third Soviet attempt to return lunar soil back to Earth. The Russian craft crashed on the moon at 15:50 UT — just a few hours before the scheduled American liftoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/5737854/Russian-spacecraft-landed-on-moon-hours-before-Americans.html|title=Russian spacecraft landed on moon hours before Americans|date=July 4, 2009|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=November 15, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a race to reach the Moon and return to Earth, the parallel missions of Luna 15 and Apollo 11 were, in many ways, the climax of the [[Space Race]] that underlay the space programs of both the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The simultaneous missions became one of the first instances of Soviet/American space cooperation as the USSR released Luna 15's flight plan to ensure it would not collide with Apollo 11, though its exact mission was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/recording-tracks-russias-moon-gatecrash-attempt-1730851.html |title=Recording tracks Russia's Moon gatecrash attempt |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |location=London |first=Jonathan |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally broke the [[circuit breaker]] that would arm the main engine for lift off from the moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the moon. Fortunately a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 7&quot; /&gt; Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author=Murray, Charles &amp; Cox, Catherine | title=Apollo: Race to the Moon | publisher=Touchstone Books | year=1990 | isbn=0-671-70625-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image: Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|right|thumb|Lunar Module ''Eagle's'' ascent stage in lunar orbit, as seen from ''Columbia''.]]

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in ''Eagle'''s ascent stage, carrying 21.5 kilograms of lunar samples with them, to rejoin CMP Michael Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit. During the launch Aldrin looked up in time to see the exhaust from the ascent module's engine knock over the American flag they had planted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orloff&quot; /&gt; After more than 2½ hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments which included a [[retroreflector]] array used for the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]] and a Passive Seismic Experiment used to measure moon quakes. They also left an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], an [[Apollo 1]] mission patch, and a [[lunar plaque|plaque]] (mounted on the LM Descent Stage ladder) bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Richard M. Nixon. The inscription read:
{{quote|''Here Men From The Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace For All Mankind.''}}
They also left behind a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the [[Apollo 11 goodwill messages|goodwill statements]] by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf|title=News Release No. 69-83F|publisher=NASA|date=July 13, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In his 1989 book, ''Men from Earth'', Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating [[Cosmonauts]] [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]] and [[Yuri Gagarin]].) Also, according to [[Deke Slayton]]'s book 'Moonshot', Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded [[Astronaut pin]] from Slayton.

Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Buzz Aldrin witnessed it topple: &quot;The ascent stage of the LM separated ...I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the [[attitude indicator]], but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | title = NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-11 | publisher = Kennedy Space Center | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo-11/apollo-11.html | accessdate = March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least {{Convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}} from the LM to prevent its being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.

[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|Aldrin salutes the flag symbolizing America's victory in the space race.]]

After rendezvous with ''Columbia'', ''Eagle's'' ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at July 21, 1969 at 23:41 UT (7:41 PM EDT). Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle's'' orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an &quot;uncertain location&quot; on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html| title=Apollo Tables|author=NASA|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location is uncertain because the ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently uncertain to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented,
:&quot;... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly ... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people ...All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, 'Thank you very much.'&quot;
Aldrin added,
:&quot;This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. 'When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?'&quot;
Armstrong concluded,
:&quot;The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo-11/apollo-11.html|title=NASA Apollo Mission Apollo 11|accessdate=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the return to Earth, the Guam tracking station failed, which would have prevented communication on the last segment of the Earth return.  Repair was not possible until a staff member had his ten-year old son, [[Greg Force]], do repairs made possible by his small hands.  Force later was thanked by Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel Rodriguez|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/20/apollo11.irpt/index.html |title=The 10-year-old who helped Apollo 11, 40 years later|publisher=Cnn.com |date= July 20, 2009|accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Splashdown and quarantine===
[[File:Splashdown 3.jpg|thumb|The ''Columbia'' floats on the ocean as navy divers assist in retrieving the astronauts.]] On July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the command module Columbia just before dawn at  {{Coord|13|19|N|169|9|W|type:event|name=Apollo 11 splashdown}}, in the Pacific Ocean {{convert|2660|km|nmi}} east of [[Wake Island]], or {{convert|380|km|nmi}} south of [[Johnston Atoll]], and {{convert|24|km|mi}} from the recovery ship, [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']].

At roughly 11:45 a.m. [[Central Standard Time|CST]] the [[drogue parachute]]s deployed. At 11:51, the command module struck the water forcefully. Initially the command module landed upside down but was righted in several minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. &quot;Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers,&quot; was Armstrong's last official transmission from the ''Columbia''. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the command module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back [[pathogen]]s from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site.  Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities onboard the ''Hornet''.  Additionally astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium-hydrochloride solution and the command module wiped with [[Betadine]] to remove any lunar dust that might be present.  The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fish|first=Bob|title=Hornet Plus Three|publisher=Beagle Bay Books|date=June 10, 2009|edition=1st|isbn=0974961078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mission Operations Control Room at the conclusion of Apollo 11.jpg|thumb|left|Mission Control at the conclusion of Apollo 11.]]
A second [[H-3 Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA [[flight surgeon]] gave each a brief physical check during the {{convert|0.5|nmi|m}} trip back to the ''Hornet''.  [[File:Apollo 11 crew in quarantine.jpg|thumb|The crew of ''Apollo 11'' in [[quarantine]] after returning to Earth, visited by Richard Nixon.]] After touchdown on the ''Hornet'', the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen.  The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the {{convert|30|ft|m}} to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] (MQF) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, [[Apollo 12]] and [[Apollo 14]], before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/ATTM/a11.jh.3.html|title=After Splashdown|date=July 1999|work=Apollo to the Moon |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard Nixon was aboard ''Hornet'' to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, &quot;As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewnixon.org/2008/07/23/24-july-1969-home-from-the-moon/|title=24&amp;nbsp;July 1969: Home From The Moon|author=Nixon Foundation|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Nixon departed, the ''Hornet'' was brought alongside the five-ton command module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF.  The ''Hornet'' sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]] where the command module and MQF were airlifted to the Johnson Space Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot; /&gt;

Years later, it was publicly revealed that Nixon had prepared a speech to be given in the event the Lunar Module had failed to lift off from the lunar surface, which would have resulted in Armstrong's and Aldrin's deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/390634.stm |title=A silent death.

The astronauts were placed in quarantine after their landing on the moon for fear that the moon might contain undiscovered [[pathogen]]s, and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their moon walks. (The decision to do so was made in accordance with the recently passed [[Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law]]). However, after almost three weeks in confinement (first in their trailer and later in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]]), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaexplores.com/extras/apollo11/hirasaki.html| title=NASA Explores... Hirasaki, the NASA engineer quarantined with the Apollo 11 crew|author=NASA Explores|accessdate=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 1969, the astronauts exited quarantine to the cheers of the American public. Parades were held in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/captured/2009/07/17/40th-anniversary-of-apollo-11-moon-landing/|title=40th Anniversary of Apollo Moon Landing photos|date=July 17, 2009|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=August 5, 2009|work=Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, they were invited by Mexico for a parade honoring them in Mexico City.

That evening in Los Angeles there was an official [[State dinner|State Dinner]] to celebrate ''Apollo 11'', attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and ambassadors from 83 nations at the [[Century Plaza Hotel]]. President Richard Nixon and Vice President [[Spiro T. Agnew]] honored each astronaut with a presentation of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day &quot;Giant Leap&quot; tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom. Many nations would honor the first manned [[moon landing]] by issuing ''Apollo 11'' commemorative postage stamps or coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lunarhall.org/missions/apollo/11.html |title=Lunar Hall of Fame: Apollo 11 mission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] on Capitol Hill. They presented two U.S. flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the moon with them.

The command module is displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], Washington, D.C. It is in the central ''Milestones of Flight'' exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the [http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/ Wright Flyer], the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Bell X-1]], the [[North American X-15]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] spacecraft ''[[Friendship 7]]'', and [[Gemini 4]]. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's ''Apollo to the Moon'' exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's [[Udvar-Hazy Center]] annex near [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia.

In 2009 the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.

==Mission insignia==
The [[Mission patch|patch]] of ''Apollo 11'' was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for &quot;peaceful lunar landing by the United States.&quot; He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an [[olive branch]] in its beak, and drew a moon background with the earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too &quot;warlike&quot; and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the [[Roman numeral]] [[11 (number)|XI]] would not be understood in some nations and went with ''Apollo 11''; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would &quot;be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Collins |first = Michael |year = 2001 |title = Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys |publisher = Cooper Square Press |isbn = 0-8154-1028-X |pages = 332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch. The LM was named ''Eagle'' to match the insignia. When the [[Eisenhower Dollar|Eisenhower dollar coin]] was released a few years later, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=NGC Photo Proof | title=1971-78 Dollar Eisenhower | url=http://coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp | work=CoinSite | publisher=ROKO Design Group, Inc | year=1994 | accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was retained for the smaller [[Susan B.

A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today...The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date...nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts - Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/space/5848707/Moon-landings-British-scientists-salute-space-heroes.html |title=Moon landings: British scientists salute space heroes |publisher=Telegraph |date=July 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2009 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Apollo 8''', the second manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], was the first [[human spaceflight]] to leave [[Earth]] orbit; the first to be captured by and escape from the gravitational field of another celestial body; and the first crewed voyage to return to Earth from another celestial body&amp;mdash;Earth's [[Moon]]. The three-man  crew of mission Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] became the first humans to travel beyond [[low Earth orbit]], the first to see Earth as a whole planet, and then the first to directly see the [[far side of the Moon]]. The 1968 mission, the first manned launch of a [[Saturn V|Saturn&amp;nbsp;V]] rocket, was also the first manned launch from the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral]].

Originally planned as a second [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]/[[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] test in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August&amp;nbsp;1968 to a more ambitious Command Module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, because the Lunar Module was not yet ready to make its first flight. This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.

After launching on December 21, 1968, Apollo 8 took three days to travel to the Moon. It orbited ten times over the course of 20&amp;nbsp;hours, during which the crew made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first 10 verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]].  At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo&amp;nbsp;8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11]] to fulfill U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.

This crew was unique among pre-shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew. This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had flown as commander subsequently flying as a non-commander, as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII.

===Backup crew ===
{{Spaceflight crew

|crew3_up         = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise, Jr]]
}}
On a lunar mission, the Command Module Pilot (CMP) was assigned the role of [[Celestial navigation|navigator]], while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was assigned the role of [[flight engineer]], responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems, even if the flight didn't include a Lunar Module.&lt;ref name='baker1' /&gt;

Lovell was originally the CMP on the back-up crew, with [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] as the prime crew's CMP. However, Collins was replaced in July&amp;nbsp;1968, after suffering a [[intervertebral disc|cervical]] [[Spinal disc herniation|disc herniation]] that required surgery to repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Michael |coauthors=Charles Lindbergh |year=2001 |title=Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys |publisher=Cooper Square Press |isbn=0-8154-1028-X |pages=288–294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrin was originally the backup LMP. When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew, no one with experience on CSM 103 (the specific spacecraft used for the mission) was available, so Aldrin was moved to CMP and Fred Haise brought in as backup LMP. Armstrong went on to command [[Apollo 11]], where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position, and Collins was assigned as CMP.

===Mission control===
The Earth-based mission control teams for Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew, as well as non-astronaut flight directors and their staffs. The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission, but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They also served as [[Capsule communicator|capcom]]s during the mission. For Apollo&amp;nbsp;8, these crew members included astronauts [[John S. Bull]], [[Vance D. Brand]], [[Gerald P. Carr]], and [[Ken Mattingly]].&lt;ref name='chronapp6'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm#Volume%20IV|title=The Apollo Spacecraft&amp;nbsp;— A Chronology.

The directors for Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 included Cliff Charlesworth (Green team), [[Glynn Lunney]] (Black team), and Milton Windler (Maroon team).&lt;ref name='expeditions1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-9-5.html |title = Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |publisher = NASA Langley Research Center |chapter = 9.5 |year = 1975 |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission insignia===
The triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the Apollo command module. It shows a red figure 8 looping around the earth and moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission. On the red number 8 are the names of the three astronauts.&lt;ref name='allwedid1'&gt;{{Cite book|title=All We Did was Fly to the Moon|author=Dick Lattimer|publisher=Whispering Eagle Press|date=June 1985|isbn=978-0-9611228-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell. Lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] flight from California to Houston, shortly after learning of the re-designation of the flight to become a [[lunar orbit]]al mission. The graphic design of the insignia was done by Houston Artist and animator, Bill Bradley.&lt;ref name='allwedid1'/&gt;

==Planning==

{{Main|List of Apollo mission types}}

[[Apollo 4]] and [[Apollo 6]] had been &quot;A&quot; missions, unmanned tests of the Saturn V launch vehicle using an unmanned Block&amp;nbsp;I production model of the Apollo Command and Service Modules into Earth Orbit. {{nowrap|[[Apollo 7]]}}, scheduled for October&amp;nbsp;1968, would be a manned Earth Orbit flight of the CSM, completing the objectives for Mission&amp;nbsp;&quot;C&quot;.

[[Image:Apollo-linedrawing.png|thumb|Apollo CSM diagram]]
Further missions depended on the readiness of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM). Apollo 8 was planned as the &quot;D&quot; mission, to test the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]] and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]], while Borman's crew would fly the &quot;E&quot; mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] as Apollo 9, in early 1969.

But production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo 8's LM arrived at [[Cape Canaveral]] in June&amp;nbsp;1968, significant defects were discovered, leading [[Grumman]], the lead contractor for the LM, to predict that the first mission-ready LM would not be ready until at least February&amp;nbsp;1969. This would mean delaying the &quot;D&quot; and subsequent missions, endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.&lt;ref name='baker1'&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Manned Space Flight|author=Baker, David |year = 1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-517-54377-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='augsep1968' /&gt;

[[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December&amp;nbsp;1968. Instead of just repeating the &quot;C&quot; mission flight of Apollo&amp;nbsp;7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until [[Apollo 10]], the scheduled &quot;F&quot; mission.&lt;ref name='augsep1968'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm#Volume%20IV|title=The Apollo Spacecraft&amp;nbsp;— A Chronology. Volume IV|publisher = NASA |year = 1975 |accessdate = 2008-01-29 |chapter = Part 2(N) - August / September 1968|chapterurl= http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2n.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that the medium Earth orbit &quot;E&quot; mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the &quot;D&quot; mission had to be delayed.

[[Image:Apollo 8 first stage in the Vehicle Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) on February 1, 1968]]
Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel, and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission, Webb eventually approved the mission change. The mission was officially changed from a &quot;D&quot; mission to a &quot;C-Prime&quot; Lunar Orbit mission, but was still referred to in press releases as an Earth Orbit mission at Webb's direction.&lt;ref name='chariots11-5'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author=Courtney G Brooks, James M.

With the change in mission for Apollo&amp;nbsp;8, Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions. McDivitt, the commander of the D mission, has said he was never offered the circumlunar flight, but would probably have turned it down, as he wanted to fly the Lunar Module. Borman, on the other hand, jumped at the chance:{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  his original mission would have largely been a repeat of the previous flight, albeit in a higher orbit. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.&lt;ref name='augsep1968' /&gt;&lt;ref name='chariots11-3'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author=Courtney G Brooks, James M. Grimwood, Loyd S. Swenson|year=1979|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=NASA|chapter=Chapter 11 Part 3|chapterurl = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch11-3.html|isbn=0-486-46756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, the crew entered the [[Space flight simulator|simulators]] to begin their preparation for the flight. By the time the mission flew, the crew had spent seven&amp;nbsp;hours training for every actual hour of flight. Although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize. Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]]. Lovell was trained on [[Celestial navigation|navigating]] the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth. Anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order.&lt;ref name='baker1' /&gt;

Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] flight of some living creatures, including [[Russian tortoise]]s, in a [[cislunar]] loop around the Moon on [[Zond 5]] and return to Earth on September 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Andrew Chaikin|Chaikin]], Andrew|title=[[A Man on the Moon]]: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation that they might be preparing to launch men on a similar [[Zond_program#Circumlunar_missions|circumlunar mission]] before the end of 1968.

The Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], the night before the launch.&lt;ref name='canoe1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi.canoe.ca/SpaceArchive/981221_30.html |title = Astronauts look back 30 years after historic lunar launch |publisher = Associated Press |date = 1998-12-21 |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They talked about how, before his [[Spirit of St. Louis|1927 flight]], Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight. The total was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V would burn every second.&lt;ref name='zimmerman1'&gt;{{cite book|title = Genesis: The Story of Apollo 8 |publisher = Four Wall Eight Windows |author = Zimmerman, Robert |year = 1998 |isbn= 1-56858-118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day, the Lindberghs watched the launch of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 from a nearby dune.&lt;ref name='zimmerman1' /&gt; Anne Morrow Lindbergh would later write a book about the Apollo program, entitled ''Earth Shine'', which mentions this mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Earth Shine|author = Lindbergh, Anne Morrow|year = 1969 |publisher = New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saturn V==
{{Main|Saturn V}}
[[Image:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 Saturn V being rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]]]
The Saturn&amp;nbsp;V rocket used by Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 was designated SA-503, or the &quot;03rd&quot; model of the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V (&quot;5&quot;) Rocket to be used in the Saturn-Apollo (&quot;SA&quot;) program. When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|Vertical Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] Command/Service Module. Apollo&amp;nbsp;6 had suffered several major problems during its April&amp;nbsp;1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V was ready.&lt;ref name='stages1'&gt;{{cite book|title=Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JnoZTbVLx0MC|author=Bilstein, Roger E.|publisher = DIANE Publishing |year = 1999|accessdate=2008-02-04|pages=360–370|isbn=0-16-048909-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='chariots10-5'&gt;.{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author=Courtney G Brooks, James M. Grimwood, Loyd S. Swenson|year=1979|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=NASA|chapter=Chapter 10 Part 5|chapterurl = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html|isbn=0-486-46756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams from the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.&lt;ref name='stages1' /&gt;

Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.&lt;ref name='stages1' /&gt;

The teams tested their solutions in August&amp;nbsp;1968 at the Marshall Space Flight Center. A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team's solution to the problem of pogo oscillation, while a Saturn Stage&amp;nbsp;II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions. Once NASA administrators were convinced that the problems were solved, they gave their approval for a manned mission using SA-503.&lt;ref name='stages1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='orloff1'&gt;{{cite book |url = http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_08a_Summary.htm |title = Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |publisher = NASA |author = Richard W.

==Mission==
===Parameter summary===
As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body, Apollo 8's profile had two different sets of orbital parameters, separated by a translunar injection maneuver.

Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal {{convert|100|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular Earth parking orbit. Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an [[apogee]] of {{convert|99.99|nmi|km|abbr=off}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|99.57|nmi|km|abbr=off}}, with an [[inclination]] of 32.51° to the [[Equator]], and an [[orbital period]] of 88.19&amp;nbsp;minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by {{convert|6.4|nmi|km}} over the 2 hours, 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;

This was followed by a [[Trans-Lunar Injection]] (TLI) burn of the [[S-IVB]] third stage for 318 seconds, accelerating the {{convert|63531|lb|kg|abbr=on}} spacecraft from an orbital velocity of {{convert|25567|ft/s|m/s}} to the injection velocity of {{convert|35505|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; which set a record for the highest speed, relative to Earth, that humans had ever traveled.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt; This speed was slightly less than the Earth's [[escape velocity]] of {{convert|36747|ft/s|m/s}}, but put Apollo 8 into an elongated elliptical Earth orbit, to a point where the Moon's gravity would capture it.&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Woods |first= W. David |title= How Apollo Flew to the Moon |publisher= Praxis Publishing |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-71675-6 |pages=108–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal {{convert|60|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a [[perilune]] of  {{convert|60.0|nmi|km}} and an [[apolune]] of {{convert|168.5|nmi|km}}, at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at {{convert|60.7|nmi|km}} by {{convert|59.7|nmi|km}}, with an orbital period of 128.7&amp;nbsp;minutes. The effect of lunar [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s (&quot;masscons&quot;) on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted; over the course of the twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to {{convert|63.6|nmi|km}} by {{convert|58.6|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;

Apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from Earth of {{convert|203,752|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;

===Launch and trans-lunar injection===
[[Image:Ap8-KSC-68PC-329.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 during launch, with a [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the Moon, which was not visible during launch]]
Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 launched at 7:51:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] on December 21, 1968, using the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V's three [[Multistage rocket|stages]], [[S-IC]], [[S-II]], and [[S-IVB]], to achieve Earth orbit. The launch phase experienced only three minor problems: The engines of the first stage, S-IC, underperformed by 0.75%, causing the engines to burn for 2.45&amp;nbsp;seconds longer than planned, and toward the end of the second stage burn, S-II, the rocket underwent [[pogo oscillation]]s. Frank Borman estimated the oscillations were approximately {{nowrap|12 [[hertz]]}} and {{nowrap|±0.25 [[g-force|''g'']]}} (±2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;

All three rocket stages fired during launch; the S-IC and S-II detached during launch.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author=Courtney G Brooks, James M.

Once in Earth orbit, both the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew and Mission Control spent the next 2&amp;nbsp;hours and 38&amp;nbsp;minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI. The proper operation of third stage of the rocket, S-IVB was crucial; In the last unmanned test, the S-IVB had failed to re-ignite for TLI.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt;

During the flight, three fellow astronauts served on the ground as [[capsule communicator]]s (usually referred to as &quot;CAPCOMs&quot;) on a rotating schedule. The CAPCOMs were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew. Michael Collins was the first CAPCOM on duty and at 2&amp;nbsp;hours, 27&amp;nbsp;minutes and 22&amp;nbsp;seconds after launch radioed, &quot;Apollo&amp;nbsp;8. You are Go for TLI&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 1 TLI&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Woods| first =W.

Over the next 12&amp;nbsp;minutes before the TLI burn, the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the S-IVB. The engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly.

After the S-IVB had performed its required tasks, it was jettisoned. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it. This marked the first time humans could view the whole Earth at once.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt; Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the Command/Service Module and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters on the Service Module to add {{convert|3|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in this direction, but at {{convert|9|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} instead.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; These discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt;

Five&amp;nbsp;hours after launch, Mission Control sent a command to the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster's trajectory. This S-IVB would then pass the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, posing no further hazard to Apollo&amp;nbsp;8. The S-IVB subsequently went into a {{convert|0.99|by|0.92|AU|Gm|lk=on|adj=on}} solar orbit with an [[inclination]] of 23.47° from the [[plane of the ecliptic]], and an orbital period of 340.80&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew were the first humans to pass through the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, which extend up to {{convert|15000|mi|km|abbr=off}} from Earth. Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft's high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest [[X-ray]], or 1 [[Gray (unit)|milligray]] (during the course of a year, the average human receives a dose of 2&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;mGy). To record the actual radiation dosages, each crew member wore a Personal Radiation [[Dosimeter]] that transmitted data to Earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By the end of the mission, the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 1.6 mGy.&lt;ref name='Biomedical'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S2ch3.htm |title = Biomedical Results of Apollo; Radiation Protection and Instrumentation |publisher = NASA, Johnson Space Center |author = J.

===Lunar trajectory===

Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was as [[flight officer|navigator]]. Although Mission Control performed all of the actual navigation calculation, it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could successfully return to Earth in case of communication loss with Mission Control. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]]. This task proved to be difficult, as a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting S-IVB made it hard to distinguish the stars.

By seven&amp;nbsp;hours into the mission, the crew was about one hour and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes behind flight plan due to the issues of moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's obscured star sightings. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also known as &quot;barbecue&quot; mode. PTC involved the spacecraft rotating about once per hour along its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over 200&amp;nbsp;°C while the parts in shadow would be −100&amp;nbsp;°C. These temperatures could cause the [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|heat shield]] to crack or propellant lines to burst. As it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft actually swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. The crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 1 Maroon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Woods| first =W. David | coauthors =Frank O'Brien| title =Apollo 8 Day 1: Maroon Team| work = Apollo Flight Journal| publisher = NASA| date = 2006-04-22| url =http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/04day1_maroon.htm|accessdate =  2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mid-course correction came 11&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight. Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Service Propulsion System]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was &quot;coated&quot; first. Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating. This first correction burn was only 2.4&amp;nbsp;seconds and added about {{convert|20.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} [[Retrograde and direct motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel).&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; This change was less than the planned {{convert|24.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} due to a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[redox|oxidizer]] lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure. The crew had to use the small Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled as the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 trajectory was found to be perfect.&lt;ref name='journal day 1 Maroon' /&gt;

11&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for over 16&amp;nbsp;hours. Before launch, NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift, but between the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises, he found sleep difficult.&lt;ref name='journal day 1 Maroon' /&gt;

[[Image:As8-16-2583.jpg|thumb|Apollo 8 [[S-IVB]] rocket stage, shortly after separation]]

About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman requested clearance to take a [[Secobarbital|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]]. However, the pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces that the crew cleaned up to the best of their ability. Borman initially decided that he did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they requested that Mission Control check the recording, stating that they &quot;would like an evaluation of the voice comments&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 2 green&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew and Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor, only one of which was used during a mission). The conference participants decided that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a [[Gastroenteritis|24-hour flu]], as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Collins |first = Michael |coauthors = Charles Lindbergh |year = 2001 |title = Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys |publisher = Cooper Square Press |isbn = 0-8154-1028-X |page = 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers now believe that he was suffering from [[space adaptation syndrome]], which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|vestibular system]] adapts to [[weightlessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Quine |first=Tony |date=April 2007|title=''Addicted to space: An appreciation of Anousheh Ansari, Part II'' |journal= ''Spaceflight''|volume=49 |issue=4 |page=144|issn=0038-6340 |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space adaptation syndrome had not been an issue on previous spacecraft ([[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]), as those astronauts were unable to move freely in the comparatively smaller cabins of those spacecraft. The increased cabin space in the Apollo Command Module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement, contributing to symptoms of spacesickness for Borman and, later, astronaut [[Russell Schweickart]] during [[Apollo 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Long-Duration Space Flight on Eye, Head, and Trunk Coordination During Locomotion|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=747|author=Kozlovskaya, Inessa B., et al.|publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center|year=2004|accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31&amp;nbsp;hours after launch. The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew used a 2&amp;nbsp;kg camera that broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. The camera had two [[lens (optics)|lenses]], a very [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle (160°) lens]], and a [[telephoto lens|telephoto (9°) lens]].&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt;

During this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space. However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper [[filter (optics)|filters]]. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17&amp;nbsp;minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[high-gain antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt;

By this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32½&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight—3½&amp;nbsp;hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt;

The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and the [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude]] required for the PTC. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.&lt;ref name='zimmerman1' /&gt;

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 made a second television broadcast at 55&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up [[filter (optics)|filters]] meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the [[telephoto lens]]. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt;

===Lunar sphere of influence===
At about 55&amp;nbsp;hours and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes into the flight, the crew of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; In other words, the effect of the Moon's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational force]] on Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 was {{convert|38759|mi|km|abbr=off}} from the Moon and had a speed of {{convert|3990|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} relative to the Moon.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only 13&amp;nbsp;hours until they would be in lunar orbit.&lt;ref name = 'lostmoon'/&gt;

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion was a second mid-course correction. It was in [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by {{convert|2.0|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; At exactly 61&amp;nbsp;hours after launch, about {{convert|24200|mi|km|abbr=off}} from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11&amp;nbsp;seconds. They would now pass {{convert|71.7|mi|km|abbr=off}} from the [[lunar surface]].&lt;ref name='zimmerman1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;

At 64&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a Go/No Go decision, the crew was told at 68&amp;nbsp;hours, they were Go and &quot;riding the best bird we can find&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 3 LOI&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Woods| first =W.

With 10&amp;nbsp;minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight [[wiktionary:oblique|oblique]]ly illuminating the lunar surface. The LOI burn was only two&amp;nbsp;minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.&lt;ref name='lostmoon' /&gt;

===Lunar orbit===
The SPS ignited at 69&amp;nbsp;hours, 8&amp;nbsp;minutes, and 16&amp;nbsp;seconds after launch and burned for 4&amp;nbsp;minutes and 13&amp;nbsp;seconds, placing the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar orbit or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have impacted the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssdc orbit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1968-118A |title=National Space Science Data Center&amp;nbsp;— Master Catalog Display|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time, the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However, this time came and went without Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 reappearing. Exactly at the calculated moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft, indicating it was in a {{convert|193.3|by|69.5|mi|km|adj=on}} orbit about the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssdc orbit&quot;/&gt;

After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:
{{quote|The Moon is essentially grey, no color; looks like [[plaster of Paris]] or sort of a grayish beach sand. We can see quite a bit of detail. The [[Mare Fecunditatis|Sea of Fertility]] doesn't stand out as well here as it does back on Earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a few of them, some of them are newer. Many of them look like—especially the round ones—look like hit by [[meteorite]]s or projectiles of some sort. [[Langrenus (crater)|Langrenus]] is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to it.

Lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over. One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that would be the Apollo&amp;nbsp;11 landing site. The launch time of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20&amp;nbsp;hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;

Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a Go/No Go decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4-123&quot; /&gt;

As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to {{convert|70.0|by|71.3|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssdc orbit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4-123&quot; /&gt;

Through the next two orbits, the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church near [[Seabrook, Texas]], but due to the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 flight was unable. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.&lt;ref name='zimmerman1' /&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4-123&quot; /&gt;

====Earthrise====
[[Image:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|Earthrise, as seen from Apollo&amp;nbsp;8, December 24, 1968]]
{{main|Earthrise}}
When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed Earthrise for the first time in human history (NASA's [[Lunar Orbiter 1]] took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on August 23, 1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;Earthrise&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

In the ensuing scramble Anders took the [[Earthrise|more famous color photo]], later picked by ''Life'' magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4-456&quot;/&gt; Due to the [[synchronous rotation]] of the Moon about the Earth, Earthrise is not generally visible from the Lunar surface. Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's [[wiktionary:Limb|limb]], where [[libration]] carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.

Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4-456&quot;/&gt; Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4-456&quot;/&gt; Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night's sleep in over three days. Taking command, he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm. On subsequent Apollo missions, crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule.
[[File:Apollo 8 genesis reading.ogg|left|thumb|The Apollo 8 Genesis reading.]]

As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being &quot;a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing.&quot;&lt;ref name='darksidexmas'&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark Side of the Moon: The Magnificent Madness of the American Lunar Quest|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7ejGJaFjLccC&amp;dq|author=De Groot, Gerard J.|chapter=Merry Christmas from the Moon|publisher=New York University Press|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-07 | isbn=978-0-8147-1995-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] (verses 1-10) from the [[Book of Genesis]]. Borman finished the [[Apollo 8 Genesis Reading|broadcast]] by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, &quot;And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, ''all of you on the good Earth''&quot;.&lt;ref name='moonport'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html|title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations|author=Benson, Charles D.|chapter=Chapter 20-9: Apollo 8 - A Christmas Gift|chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch20-9.html|publisher=NASA |year=1978|accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the Trans-Earth Injection (TEI), which was scheduled for 2½&amp;nbsp;hours after the end of the television transmission. The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in Lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.

The burn occurred exactly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89&amp;nbsp;hours, 28&amp;nbsp;minutes, and 39&amp;nbsp;seconds, the exact time calculated. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, &quot;Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]]&quot;, to which [[Ken Mattingly]], the current CAPCOM, replied, &quot;That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;journal day 4 TEI&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Woods| first =W.

===Unplanned manual re-alignment===
Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard. However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the inertial measuring unit (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to &quot;correct&quot; the module's attitude.&lt;ref name='canoe1'/&gt;

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten&amp;nbsp;minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars [[Rigel]] and [[Sirius]] aligned, and another 15&amp;nbsp;minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.&lt;ref name='lostmoon'&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13|year=1994|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|author=Jim Lovell, Jeffery Kluger|isbn=0-395-67029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

16 months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the [[Apollo 13]] mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'', Lovell wrote, &quot;My training &amp;#91;on Apollo 8&amp;#93; came in handy!&quot; In that book he dismissed the incident as a &quot;planned experiment&quot;, requested by the ground crew.&lt;ref name='lostmoon' /&gt; In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake.&lt;ref name='canoe1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='zimmerman1' /&gt;

===Cruise back to Earth and re-entry===
The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter 2½&amp;nbsp;days after TEI and [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splash down]] in the Pacific.

On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space. When they had finished broadcasting they found a small present from [[Deke Slayton]] in the food locker—real turkey with stuffing and three miniature bottles of brandy (which remained unopened; forty years later, Lovell would sell his at a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction for $17,925&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6007&amp;Lot_No=41081]&lt;/ref&gt;). There were also small presents to the crew from their wives. The next day, at about 124 hours into the mission, the sixth and final TV transmission showed the mission's best video images of the earth, in a short four minute broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

[[Image:Ap8-S68-56310.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 8 Command Module on the deck of the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']]]]
After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry. The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward. If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.

Once the Command Module was separated from the Service Module, the astronauts were committed to re-entry. Six&amp;nbsp;minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists.&lt;ref name='splashdown1'&gt;{{cite web| last = Woods| first =W. David| coauthors =Frank O'Brien| title =Apollo 8 Day 6: Maroon Team, Splashdown| work = Apollo Flight Journal| publisher = NASA| date = 2006-04-22| url =http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/22day6_maroon_splash.htm| accessdate =  2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] formed around the spacecraft. The spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6&amp;nbsp;g (59&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt; With the computer controlling the descent by changing the [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]] of the spacecraft, Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean. At {{convert|30000|ft|km|abbr=off}} the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at {{convert|10000|ft|km|abbr=off}} by the three main parachutes. The spacecraft splashdown position was estimated to be {{Coord|8|6|N|165|1|W|name=Apollo 8 estimated splashdown}}.&lt;ref name='splashdown1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='HistDB1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19880016045_1988016045.pdf|format=PDF|title=NASA Historical Data Book&amp;nbsp;— Volume II&amp;nbsp;— Programs and Projects 1958 - 1968|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it hit the water, the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down, in what was termed Stable&amp;nbsp;2 position. As they were buffeted by a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} swell, Borman was sick, waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft.&lt;ref name='chariots11-6' /&gt; It was 43&amp;nbsp;minutes after splashdown before the first [[frogman]] from the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']] arrived, as the spacecraft had landed before sunrise. Forty-five&amp;nbsp;minutes later, the crew was safe on the deck of the aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name='orloff1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='splashdown1' /&gt;

==Historical importance==
Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval in the US. Yet, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine chose the crew of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 as their [[Person of the Year|Men of the Year]] for 1968, recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900486,00.html|title=Men of the Year|date=1969-01-03|publisher=TIME Magazine|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body. They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that simply stated, &quot;Thank you Apollo&amp;nbsp;8. You saved 1968.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the [[Earthrise]] picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon. This was the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera, and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Aerospace Technology Innovation | url=http://ipp.nasa.gov/innovation/Innovation_84/wnewview.html | title=New Views for A New Century | last=Peggy | first=Wilhide | date=July/August 2000 | volume=8 | issue=4 | accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected as the first of ''Life'' magazine's 'hundred photos that changed the world'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life100&quot;&gt;Life Magazine (2003) ''100 Photographs That Changed the World.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Apollo 8 is regarded by some as the most historically significant of all the Apollo missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;earthrise&quot;&gt;Robert Poole, ''Earthrise: How Man First Saw the Earth'' (Yale, 2008) explores the Apollo 8 mission and the historic impact of its pictures of Earth. [http://www.earthrise.org.uk Earthrise]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] by [[John Glenn]] in 1962. There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the BBC coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages. The Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' featured a quote from Boris Nikolaevich Petrov, Chairman of the Soviet [[Intercosmos]] program, who described the flight as an &quot;outstanding achievement of American space sciences and technology&quot;.&lt;ref name='Pravda'&gt;{{cite news|author=Boris Nikolaevich Petrov|title=&quot;O polete Apollona-8&quot; (On the flight of Apollo-8)|publisher=Pravda |location=Moscow, USSR |date=1968-12-30 |accessdate=2008-02-13 |language={{ru icon}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon. The Apollo 8 broadcasts won an Emmy, the highest honor given by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/moon/peopleevents/e_telecasts.html Telecasts From Apollo 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheism|Atheist]] [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from Genesis.&lt;ref name = &quot;prayer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|page=623}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Hair wished the courts to ban US astronauts—who were all government employees—from public prayer in space.&lt;ref name = &quot;prayer&quot;/&gt; Though the case was rejected by the US Supreme Court for lack of jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=397&amp;invol=531&amp;friend=nytimes|title=O'Hair v. Paine, 397 U.S. 531|year=1970|publisher=Findlaw|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program. Buzz Aldrin, on Apollo 11, self-communicated [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Eucharist|Communion]] on the surface of the moon after landing;&lt;ref name = &quot;aldrin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|pages=204, 623}}&lt;/ref&gt; he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years, and only obliquely referred to it at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;aldrin&quot;/&gt;

In 1969, the US Postal Service issued a postage stamp ([[Scott number|Scott #]] 1371) commemorating the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 flight around the moon. The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the [[Earthrise]] over the moon taken by Anders on Christmas Eve, and the words, &quot;In the beginning God...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1847usa.com/identify/1960s/1969.htm|title=Postage Stamps of the United States First Issued in 1969|publisher=1847USA|accessdate=2008-02-01| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080119131736/http://1847usa.com/identify/1960s/1969.htm| archivedate = January 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
Apollo&amp;nbsp;8's historic mission has been shown and referred to in several forms, both documentary and fiction. The various television transmissions and 16&amp;nbsp;mm footage shot by the crew of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 was compiled and released by NASA in the 1969 documentary, ''Debrief: Apollo 8'', which was hosted by [[Burgess Meredith]].&lt;ref&gt;Released on DVD as a bonus feature for The Discovery Channel's miniseries, 'When We Left Earth'&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Spacecraft Films released, in 2003, a three-disc DVD set containing all of NASA's TV and 16mm film footage related to the mission including all TV transmissions from space, training and launch footage, and motion pictures taken in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

An '''astronaut''' or '''cosmonaut''' is a person trained by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]].
While generally reserved for professional space travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf|title=Astronaut Fact Book|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2006|author=[[NASA]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;utah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784|title=Former astronaut visits USU|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=The Utah Statesman|year=2005|author=Marie MacKay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military, or by civilian space agencies. With the sub-orbital flight of the privately-funded [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

===English===
In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an '''astronaut'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54 TheSpaceRace.com – Glossary of Space Exploration Terminology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning &quot;star&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. The first known use of the term &quot;astronaut&quot; in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story &quot;The Death's Head Meteor&quot; in 1930. The word itself had been known earlier. For example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', &quot;astronaut&quot; referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) of [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by &quot;aeronaut&quot;, an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists.

The first known formal use of the term [[astronautics]] in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAFpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = |first = | title = IAF History | publisher = [[International Astronautical Federation]] |author=IAF |date = 2010-08-16| url = http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History| accessdate = 2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its Astronaut Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Dismukes |first = Kim – NASA Biography Page Curator | title = Astronaut Biographies | publisher = [[Johnson Space Center]],NASA |author=NASA|date = 2005-12-15| url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| accessdate = 2007-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its Astronaut Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESApage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = |first = | title = The European Astronaut Corps | publisher = [[ESA]] |author=ESA |date = 2008-04-10| url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| accessdate = 2008-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
{{Main|Soviet space program}}
By convention, an astronaut employed by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor) is called a '''cosmonaut''' in English texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;/&gt; The word is an [[anglicisation]] of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'' ({{lang-ru|космонавт}} {{IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaft}}), one who works in space outside the Earth′s atmosphere, a space traveller,&lt;ref name=&quot;space traveller&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=6DhWw_cYLicC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%CC%81%D0%B2%D1%82%20space%20traveler&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Elsevier's dictionary of geography: in English, Russian, French, ... – Page 49]&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Greek words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning &quot;universe&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. For the most part, &quot;cosmonaut&quot; and &quot;astronaut&quot; are synonyms in all languages, and the usage of choice is often dictated by political reasons.

The Soviet Air Force pilot [[Yuri Gagarin]] was the first cosmonaut. A Russian factory worker [[Valentina Tereshkova]] was the first woman cosmonaut, as well as arguably the first civilian cosmonaut (see [[#Civilian and non-government milestones|below]] for a further discussion of civilians in space). On March 14, 1995, [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, arguably becoming the first &quot;American cosmonaut&quot;.

===Chinese===
{{Main|Chinese space program}}
Official English-language texts issued by the government of the People's Republic of China use ''astronaut'' while texts in Russian use космонавт (''kosmonavt'').&lt;ref name=&quot;rus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/ceka/rus/xwdt/t216370.htm|title=Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan press-release|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=fmprc.gov.cn|author=реконмендовать другому|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rus2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ru.china-embassy.org/rus/xwdt/t73142.htm|title=Chinese embassy in Russia press-release|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=ru.china-embassy.org|author=ru.china-embassy.org|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the terms &quot;yǔhángyuán&quot; ({{lang|zh|宇航员}}, &quot;sailing personnel in universe&quot;) or &quot;hángtiānyuán&quot; ({{lang|zh|航天员}}, &quot;sailing personnel in sky&quot;) have long been used for astronauts. The phrase &quot;tàikōng rén&quot; ({{lang|zh|太空人}}, &quot;spaceman&quot;) is often used in [[Taiwan]] and Hong Kong.

The term '''taikonaut''' is used by some English-language news media organizations for professional [[Chinese space program|space travelers from China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/26/content_7500262.htm|title=Chinese taikonaut dismisses environment worries about new space launch center|date=2008-01-26|accessdate=2008-09-25|publisher=[[China View]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word has featured in the [[Longman]] and [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English]] dictionaries,  the latter of which describes it as &quot;a hybrid of the Chinese term ''taikong'' (space) and the Greek ''naut'' (sailor)&quot;; the term became more common in 2003 when China sent its first astronaut [[Yang Liwei]] into space aboard the ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/25/content_10111749.htm|title=&quot;Taikonauts&quot; a sign of China's growing global influence|date=2008-09-25|accessdate=2008-09-25|publisher=[[China View]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the term used by Xinhua in the English version of the Chinese People's Daily since the advent of the Chinese space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90881/6507790.html|title=Chinese taikonaut debuts spacewalk|accessdate=September 28, 2008 |publisher=People's Daily Online|author=Xinhua|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin of the term is unclear; as early as May 1998, Chiew Lee Yih ({{lang|zh|赵里昱}}) from [[Malaysia]], used it in [[newsgroup]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiew&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Lee Yih | last=Chiew | coauthors= |date=1998-05-19| title=Google search of &quot;taikonaut&quot; sort by date |url = http://groups.google.com/groups?q=taikonaut&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N&amp;scoring=d&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=24&amp;as_maxm=5&amp;as_maxy=1998&amp;safe=off&amp; | work = Usenet posting | publisher = Chiew Lee Yih | author=Chiew Lee Yih| accessdate = 2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chiew2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Lee Yih | last=Chiew |date=1996-03-10| coauthors= | title=Chiew Lee Yih misspelled &quot;taikonaut&quot; 2 years before it first appear |url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.chinese.text/browse_thread/thread/a7f02b9489c59c5b/dd9e7a1b78d7d5c7?hl=en&amp;lnk=st&amp;q=taikonout#dd9e7a1b78d7d5c7 | work = Usenet posting | publisher = Chiew Lee Yih | author=Chiew Lee Yih| accessdate = 2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;evilmonkeyontaikonaut&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Monkey | last=Evil| coauthors= | title=    The earliest use of the term found in Google Groups is on that date.[1] Evil Monkey → Talk 03:07, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)  |url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Astronaut/Archive_1#Taikonaut_probably_not_coined_by_Chiew_Lee_Yih | work = Wikipedia discussion on astronaut |date=2005-01-24| publisher = Evil Monkey | author=Evil Monkey| accessdate = 2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other terms===
With the rise of [[space tourism]], [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to use the term &quot;[[spaceflight participant]]&quot; to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

While no nation other than Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), the United States, and China has launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term '''spationaut''' (French spelling: ''spationaute'') is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the [[Latin]] word ''spatium'' or &quot;space&quot;, and the [[Malay language|Malay]] term '''angkasawan''' was used to describe participants in the [[Angkasawan program]]. In Hungary the word describing astronauts is '''űrhajós''' (from ''űr'' meaning &quot;space&quot; and ''hajós'' meaning &quot;sailor&quot;.)

Depending on the exact definition of 'civilian', the first civilian in space was either [[Valentina Tereshkova]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74|title=Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA}}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard [[Vostok 6]] (she also became the first woman in space on that mission) or [[Joseph Albert Walker]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Civilians in Space&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Space.com Joseph A Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[X-15 Flight 90]] a month later. Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time. Joe Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight. The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both [[Konstantin Feoktistov]] and [[Boris Yegorov]] aboard [[Voskhod 1]].

The first non-governmental space traveler was [[Byron K. Lichtenberg]],  a researcher from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who flew on [[STS-9]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;lichten&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/lichtenberg-bk.html|title=Byron K. Lichtenberg Biography|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=NASA|year=2002|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1990, [[Toyohiro Akiyama]] became the first paying space traveler as a reporter for [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]], a visit to [[Mir]] as part of an estimated $12 million ([[USD]]) deal with a Japanese TV station, although at the time, the term used to refer to Akiyama was &quot;Research Cosmonaut&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/GAL114/SpaceRace/sec500/sec535.htm|title=Paying for a Ride|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|year=2007|author=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/mir/1990.stm|title=Mir Space Station 1986–2001|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=BBC News|year=1990|author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;de&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/international/english/akiyama_toyohiro.htm|title=Akiyama|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Spacefacts|year=1990|author=Spacefacts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akiyama suffered severe space-sickness during his mission, which affected his productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;/&gt; 

The first self-funded [[space tourist]] was [[Dennis Tito]] on board the Russian spacecraft  Soyuz TM-3 on 28 April 2001.

===Self-funded travelers===
{{Main|Space tourism}}
The first person to fly on an entirely privately-funded mission was [[Mike Melvill]], piloting [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P]] on a sub-orbital journey, although he was a [[test pilot]] employed by [[Scaled Composites]] and not an actual paying space tourist.&lt;ref name=&quot;eve&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/SS1_pilot_040620.html|title=Pilot Announced on Eve of Private Space Mission |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Space.com|year=2004|author=Leonard David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rci&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roycecarlton.com/speakers/melvill.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011134507/http://www.roycecarlton.com/speakers/melvill.html|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=Michael Melvill, First Civilian Astronaut, SpaceShipOne|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Royce Carlton Inc.|year=2007|author=Royce Carlton Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven others have paid to fly into space:

==Training==
{{See also|Astronaut ranks and positions}}
The first NASA astronauts were selected for training in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerospacescholars.jsc.nasa.gov/HAS/cirr/ss/3/3.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070819111027/http://aerospacescholars.jsc.nasa.gov/HAS/cirr/ss/3/3.cfm|archivedate=2007-08-19|title=Astronaut Candidate Training|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=NASA|year=2006|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in the space program, military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at NASA, although neither John Glenn nor Scott Carpenter (of the [[Mercury Seven]]) had any university degree, in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection.  Selection was initially limited to military pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070910124735/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html|archivedate=2007-09-10|title=Selection and Training of Astronauts|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=NASA|year=1995|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nolen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Nolen, Stephanie |title=Promised The Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race |publisher=Penguin Canada |location=Toronto |year=2002 |page=235 |isbn=0-14-301347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest astronauts for both America and Russia tended to be [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]] pilots, and were often test pilots.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through 20 months of training in a variety of areas, including training for [[extra-vehicular activity]] in a facility such as NASA's [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot;/&gt; Astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of [[weightlessness]] in aircraft called the &quot;[[vomit comet]]&quot;, the nickname given to a pair of modified [[KC-135]]s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]) which perform [[Parabola|parabolic]] flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot;/&gt; Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in [[T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft]] out of [[Ellington Field]], due to its proximity to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].  Ellington Field is also where the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are done out of [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

==Health risks of space travel==
{{See also|Space medicine}}

Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness, barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, sleep disturbances, and radiation injury. A variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the National Space and Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) to address these issues. Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study in which astronauts (including former ISS commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine: http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station: http://radiology.rsna.org/content/234/2/319.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].  This follows the practice established in the Soviet Union.

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut_Badge#NASA_Astronaut_Pins|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) in altitude.

[[File:amf space mirror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Space Mirror Memorial]]

==Deaths==
{{Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents}}

Eighteen astronauts have lost their lives during four spaceflight missions. By nationality, they are 12 Americans, four Russians ([[Soviet Union]]), one Indian, and one Israeli.

Eleven people have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments. 

The [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight  and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, a civilian [[spaceflight participant]] who died in the Challenger disaster, and an international astronaut who was killed in the Columbia disaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland From Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick''''',&lt;ref&gt;''A Modest Proposal'' available free for download from online library, Project Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1080&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as '''''A Modest Proposal''''', is a [[Juvenalian satire|Juvenalian]] satirical essay written and published anonymously by [[Jonathan Swift]] in 1729. Swift suggests that impoverished [[Ireland|Irish]] might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies.&lt;ref&gt;13th October 2010 http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/restaurants-and-bars/from-cradle-to-crock-pot-20101013-16imh.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as British policy in Ireland in general.

==Details==
Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing  the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon then-prominent [[William Petty]] and the social engineering popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of &quot;a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London&quot; and &quot;the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]&quot; (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706). This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained [[irony]] in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states, &quot;A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether [[stew]]ed, [[roasting|roasted]], [[baking|baked]], or [[boiling|boiled]]; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout|ragoust]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers unacquainted with its reputation as a satirical work often do not immediately realize that Swift was not seriously proposing [[cannibalism]] and [[infanticide]], nor would readers unfamiliar with the satires of [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]] recognize that Swift's essay follows the rules and structure of Latin satires.

The satirical element of the pamphlet is often only understood after the reader notes the allusions made by Swift to the attitudes of landlords, such as the following: &quot;I grant this food may be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for Landlords, who as they have already devoured most of the Parents, seem to have the best Title to the Children.&quot; Swift extends the metaphor to get in a few jibes at England’s mistreatment of Ireland, noting that &quot;For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:
{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.

Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that
there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population solutions==
It has been argued&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p76&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p76&lt;/ref&gt; that Swift’s main target in ''A Modest Proposal'' was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills. Swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labor issues with a simple cure-all solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p85&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p85&lt;/ref&gt; A memorable example of these sorts of schemes &quot;involved the idea of running the poor through a [[joint-stock company]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p85&quot;/&gt; In response, Swift’s ''Modest Proposal'' was &quot;a burlesque of projects concerning the poor&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsk_p88&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p88&lt;/ref&gt; that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

''A Modest Proposal'' also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who &quot;regard people as commodities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p101&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p101&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, Swift adopts the &quot;technique of a political arithmetician&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p95&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p95&lt;/ref&gt; to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift’s intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically &quot;the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defense of crime (arrogated to Marx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p95&quot;/&gt; Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that &quot;springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p98&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
Charles K. Smith argues that Swift’s rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift’s specific strategy is twofold, using a &quot;trap&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 135&lt;/ref&gt; to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, &quot;details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty&quot; but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p136&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p136&lt;/ref&gt; Swift’s use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator’s cool approach towards them create &quot;two opposing points of view&quot; that &quot;alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses &quot;the vocabulary of animal husbandry&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 138&quot;&gt;Lewis 138&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift’s rhetoric can easily turn &quot;people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 138&quot;/&gt;

Swift uses the proposer’s serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, text book approved order of argument from Swift’s time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 139&quot;&gt;Lewis 139&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast between the &quot;careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme&quot; and &quot;the ridiculousness of the proposal&quot; create a situation in which the reader has &quot;to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 139&quot;/&gt;

==Tertullian’s ''Apology''==
Some scholars have argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was largely influenced and inspired by [[Tertullian]]’s [[Apologeticus|''Apology'']]. While Tertullian’s ''Apology'' is a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity, Swift’s ''A Modest Proposal'' addresses the Anglo-Irish situation in the 1720s. James William Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p563&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson notes Swift’s obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works ''A Modest Proposal'' and ''Apology''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p562&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p562&lt;/ref&gt; In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that &quot;human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;/&gt; Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;/&gt;  In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony.  Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic &quot;justification by ownership&quot; over the subject of sacrificing children&amp;mdash;Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker_p219&quot;&gt;Baker, ''Tertullian and Swift's A Modest Proposal'', p219&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/021909/books1.html&lt;/ref&gt; that ''A Modest Proposal'' was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay ''The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children'' by Swift's rival [[Daniel Defoe]].

==Economic themes==
Robert Phiddian's article &quot;Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal&quot; focuses on two aspects of ''A Modest Proposal'': the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer.  Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer.  He reminds readers that &quot;there is a gap between the narrator’s meaning and the text’s, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p6&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p6&lt;/ref&gt;

While Swift’s proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of &quot;Swift’s Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet&quot;, argues that to understand the piece fully, it is important to understand the economics of Swift’s time.  Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labor in 18th century England.  &quot;[I]f one regards the ''Modest Proposal'' simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p3&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p3&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that &quot;people are the riches of the nation&quot;, and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p4&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p4&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, &quot;in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry&quot;.  In those times, the &quot;somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p6&quot;/&gt;

==People are the riches of a nation==
Louis A. Landa presents Swift’s ''A Modest Proposal'' as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that &quot;people are the riches of a nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p161&quot;&gt;Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p161&lt;/ref&gt; Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland’s case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;&gt;Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p165&lt;/ref&gt; The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person that does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;/&gt; Swift also recognizes the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;/&gt; Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticizing economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanizing them by viewing them as a mere commodity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;/&gt;

==Modern usage==
''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many literature programs as an example of [[Satire#Early modern western satire|early modern western satire]]. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.

It has been emulated many times as well. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in social [[conservative]] polemic against [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] in a future [[dystopia]] that advocated [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]] and [[fetuses]], as well as some [[disabled]] infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the [[pro-life]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as disability discrimination.)

[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s [[Fear and Loathing in America|''Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist'']], which contains hundreds of private letters written by Thompson over the years, contains a letter in which he uses ''A Modest Proposal'''s satire technique against the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he was going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. This letter protests the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.

===In popular culture===
The game ''Orphan Feast'' on Cartoon Network's [[Adult Swim]] website is loosely based on ''A Modest Proposal''.

The show ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' references ''A Modest Proposal'' by the character of Jodene Sparks. It was suggested as recommended reading when Debbie wanted a child.

''A Modest Proposal'' is the name of [[The University of Texas at Dallas]]' Alternative Student Newspaper, the monthly opinion paper of the University; it was also the name of a regular column in ''SWIFT Magazine'' of [[Harvard University]], a satire publication that also takes its name from Jonathan Swift.

''A Modest Proposal'' is mentioned in the 1996 film ''[[The Birdcage]]''.

[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]] writer/creator [[Kim Henkel]] cited &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; as an influence in scripting his 2011 horror film &quot;Boneboys,&quot; directed by Duane Graves and Justin Meeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/headlines/20101126-boneboys_cannibal-comedy-traces-roots-back-to-texas-chain-saw-massacre.ece Dallas Morning News&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversial [[United States|American]] [[political activist]] and [[disbarment|disbarred]] [[attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson's]] [[A Modest Video Game Proposal]] draws its title from ''A Modest Proposal''.

On the December 13, 2010 episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Stephen reads a passage of ''A Modest Proposal'' in support of Ted Turner's suggestions on reducing overpopulation by having poor people sell (to rich people) their right to bear a single child per family.

In Tanzania, a popular  writer, columnist and satirist M. M. Mwanakijiji has attempted to emulate Swift in his own 'A Modest Proposal - On how Chagga People should be removed from Power and Positions of Affluence&quot;. For most Swahili speakers the use of satire in writing is a new development. His essay had the same shock value to some readers who were not exposed to Swift's original 'modest proposal'.

The '''alkali metals''' are a [[group (periodic table)|series]] of [[chemical element]]s in the [[periodic table]]. In the modern [[IUPAC]] nomenclature, the alkali metals are called the '''Group 1 elements'''. Previously, they were called the '''Group IA elements''', with &quot;A&quot; representing the [[main group element]]s and [[Roman numeral]] &quot;I&quot; representing the first group within the main-group series. The alkali metals include '''[[lithium]]''' ('''Li'''), '''[[sodium]]''' ('''Na'''), '''[[potassium]]''' ('''K'''), '''[[rubidium]]''' ('''Rb'''), '''[[caesium]]''' ('''Cs'''){{#tag:ref|''Caesium'' is the spelling recommended by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{RedBook2005|pages=248–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) has used the spelling ''cesium'' since 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-first = Anne M. | editor1-last = Coghill | editor2-first = Lorrin R. | editor2-last = Garson | year = 2006 | title = The ACS Style Guide: Effective Communication of Scientific Information | edition = 3rd | publisher = American Chemical Society | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 0-8412-3999-1 | page = 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal=Pure Appl.

This group lies in the [[s-block]] of the periodic table, which means that all its elements have their [[electron configuration|outermost electron]] in an [[atomic orbital|s-orbital]]. The s-block also includes [[alkaline earth metal]]s, plus hydrogen and [[helium]]. The alkali metals provide one of the best examples of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with well characterized [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] behaviour down the group.

All of the alkali metals discovered, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, are naturally occurring, although francium is the second-rarest naturally occurring element. These metals share similar chemical properties: they are all highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals under standard conditions. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of the next member of the group, which is probably '''[[ununennium]]''' ('''Uue'''), but these have all met with failure, but since ununennium is the first [[period 8 element]] and only the first element on the periodic table that has not been discovered, it is likely to be found in the near future. Note that ununennium may not be the next alkali metal due to [[relativistic effect]]s.

==Characteristics==
===Chemistry===
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its [[electronic configuration]], especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behaviour:

The alkali metals are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in [[mineral oil]] or [[kerosene]] (paraffin oil). They also tarnish easily and have low melting points and densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemicalelements.com/groups/alkali.html |title=Alkali Metals |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, the alkali metals are mostly silver-colored, except for metallic caesium, which can have a golden [[tint]]. These elements are all soft [[metal]]s of low [[density]]. [[chemistry|Chemically]], all of the alkali metals react aggressively with the [[halogen]]s to form [[ionic salt]]s. They all react with water to form strongly [[alkali]]ne [[hydroxide]]s. The vigor of reaction increases down the group. All of the [[atom]]s of alkali metals have one [[electron]] in their [[valence shell]]s, hence their only way for achieving the equivalent of filled outmost electron shells is to give up one electron to an element with high [[electronegativity]], and hence to become singly [[electric charge|charged]] positive [[ion]]s, i.e. cations.

[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|thumb|right|150px|Caesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures]]
The alkali metals have the lowest [[Ionization enthalpy|ionization enthalpies]] in their periods of the [[periodic table]], because the removal of their single electrons from their outmost electron shells gives them the stable electron configuration of inert gases. Another way of stating this is that they all have a high [[electropositivity]]. The &quot;second ionization potential&quot; of all of the alkali metals is very high, since removing any electron from an atom having a noble gas configuration is difficult to do.

[[Image:Alkalimetalle.jpg|thumb|Series of alkali metals, stored in mineral oil (&quot;Natrium&quot; is sodium.)]]
All of the alkali metals are notable for their vigorous reactions with water, and these reactions become increasingly vigorous when going down their column in the periodic table towards the heaviest alkali metals, such as caesium. Their chemical reactions with water are as follows:

Alkali metal + water → Alkali metal hydroxide + hydrogen gas

For a typical example (M represents an alkali metal):

:2 M (s) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 MOH (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Alkali metals form a very wide range of amalgams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0079-6786(97)81004-7|title=Alkali metal amalgams, a group of unusual alloys|year=1997|last1=Deiseroth|first1=H|journal=Progress in Solid State Chemistry|volume=25|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They tend to form ionically bonded [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] with most electronegative elements on the periodic table, like [[caesium fluoride]] and [[sodium chloride]].

===Physics===
[[Potassium]] and [[rubidium]] are naturally weakly radioactive as they have naturally occurring [[radioisotope]]s ({{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Potassium|40}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Rubidium|87}}) and [[francium]]'s only naturally occuring isotope ({{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Francium|223}}) is also radioactive with a [[half-life]] of only 22.0 minutes. [[Caesium]] was also thought to have natural radioisotopes before the discovery of francium, which made the group strange compared to the others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The alkali metals show a number of trends when moving down the group – for instance: decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling point. Their densities generally increase, with the notable exception that potassium is less dense than sodium, and the possible exception of francium being less dense than caesium (the highly [[radioactive]] element francium only exists in microscopic quantities, so its physical properties have not been measured).

Below, hydrogen is included for comparison.

==Hydrogen==
{{Main|Hydrogen}}
The element [[hydrogen]], with its solitary one electron per atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not counted as an alkali metal. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a [[diatomic]] [[gas]] consisting of two atoms per [[molecule]].

The removal of the single electron of hydrogen requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron from the atoms of the alkali metals. As in the halogens, only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen, forming the negative [[hydride]] ion. [[Binary compound]]s of hydrogen with the alkali metals and some [[transition metal]]s have been produced in the laboratory, but these are only laboratory curiosities without much practical use. Under extremely high [[pressure]]s and low temperatures, such as those found at the cores of the planets [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], hydrogen does become metallic, and it behaves like an alkali metal. This type of hydrogen is known as [[metallic hydrogen]].

Hydrogen is sometimes considered to be an alkali metal as it, like the other alkali metals, has one valence electron; however, hydrogen rarely acts like an alkali metal, as can be seen from the data above. In fact, it is sometimes placed over [[lithium]] (due to its [[electron configuration]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;iupac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/ |title=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry &gt; Periodic Table of the Elements |publisher=IUPAC |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sometimes [[carbon]] (due to its [[electronegativity]])&lt;ref name=&quot;laing&quot; /&gt; and sometimes [[fluorine]] (due to its chemical properties).&lt;ref name=&quot;laing&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1071h5g182j723w|title=Where to Put Hydrogen in a Periodic Table?|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|year=2006|author=Michael Laing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithium===
[[File:Petalite.jpg|thumb|right|150px|alt=A sample of petalite|Petalite]]
[[Petalite]] (LiAlSi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) was discovered in 1800 by the [[Brazil]]ian chemist [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]] in a mine on the island of [[Utö, Sweden]].&lt;ref name=mindat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-3171.html|title=Petalite Mineral Information |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=webelementshistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/lithium/history.html|title=Lithium:Historical information |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovery of the Elements |last=Weeks |first=Mary|year=2003 |page=124 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location=Whitefish, Montana, United States |isbn=0766138720 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1817 that [[Johan August Arfwedson]], then working in the laboratory of the chemist [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], [[discovery of the chemical elements|detected]] the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.&lt;ref name=berzelius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemeddl.org/collections/ptl/ptl/chemists/bios/arfwedson.html |title=Johan August Arfwedson |accessdate=10 August 2009 |work= Periodic Table Live!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uwis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genchem.chem.wisc.edu/lab/PTL/PTL/BIOS/arfwdson.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080605152857/http://genchem.chem.wisc.edu/lab/PTL/PTL/BIOS/arfwdson.htm |archivedate=2008-06-05 |title=Johan Arfwedson |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict|title = Lithium| first = Peter|last =van der Krogt|url =http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Li|accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This element formed compounds similar to those of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]], though its [[lithium carbonate|carbonate]] and [[lithium hydroxide|hydroxide]] were less [[solubility|soluble in water]] and more [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]].&lt;ref name=compounds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/compounds.html|title=Compounds of the Group 1 Elements |accessdate=10 August 2009 |last=Clark |first=Jim |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name &quot;''lithion''/''lithina''&quot;, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''λιθoς'' (transliterated as ''lithos'', meaning &quot;stone&quot;), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood.

===Sodium===
[[File:SodiumHydroxide.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=A sample of caustic soda|Caustic soda]]
Although sodium (sometimes called &quot;soda&quot; in [[English language|English]]) has long been recognized in compounds, it was not isolated until 1807 by [[Humphry Davy]] through the [[electrolysis]] of [[caustic soda]].&lt;ref name=Davy1807&gt;{{cite journal |first=Humphry |last=Davy |title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes produced by electricity, particularly the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances which constitute their bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies |year=1808 |volume=98 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |pages=1–44 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q |doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potassium===
[[File:PotashUSGOV.jpg|thumb|right|150px|alt=A sample of caustic potash|Caustic potash]]
Potassium metal was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir [[Humphry Davy]], who derived it from [[Potassium hydroxide|caustic potash]] (KOH), by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly discovered [[voltaic pile]]. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.&lt;ref name=Enghag2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Enghag, P.|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of the elements|publisher=Wiley-VCH Weinheim|isbn=3527306668|chapter=11.

===Rubidium===
[[File:Lepidolite-76774.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=A sample of lepidolite|Lepidolite]]
[[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] were the first to suggest finding new elements by [[spectrum analysis]]. Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Bunsen and Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the [[mineral]] [[lepidolite]] through the use of a [[spectroscope]]. Because of the bright red lines in its [[emission spectrum]], they chose a name derived from the [[Latin]] word ''rubidus'', dark red.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen |pages = 337–381 |first1 = G.|last1 = Kirchhoff, |first2 = R.|last2 = Bunsen|authorlink1 = Gustav Kirchhoff|authorlink2 = Robert Bunsen|doi = 10.1002/andp.18611890702 |journal = [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] |volume = 189 |issue = 7|year = 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The discovery of the elements.

===Caesium===
In 1860, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in the [[mineral water]] from [[Bad Dürkheim|Dürkheim]], [[Germany]]. Due to the bright blue lines in its [[emission spectrum]], they chose a name derived from the Latin word ''caesius'', meaning sky-blue.&lt;ref&gt;Bunsen quotes [[Aulus Gellius]] [[Aulus Gellius|Noctes Atticae]] II, 26 by [[Nigidius Figulus]]: ''Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = The discovery of the elements.

===Francium===
Francium (then known as ''[[Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[caesium]]'', because it is below caesium in the [[periodic table]]) was discovered in 1939 by [[Marguerite Perey]] of the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]] in [[Paris, France]] when she purified a sample of [[actinium]]-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220&amp;nbsp;keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&amp;nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being [[thorium]], [[radium]], [[lead]], [[bismuth]], or [[thallium]]. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemeducator&quot;&gt;Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B. (2005-09-25). [http://chemeducator.org/sbibs/s0010005/spapers/1050387gk.htm Francium (Atomic Number 87), the Last Discovered Natural Element]. ''The Chemical Educator'' '''10''' (5). Retrieved on 2007-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of [[beta decay]] to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgraw&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| contribution = Francium| year = 2002| title = [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology]]| volume = 7| pages = 493–494| publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn = 0-07-913665-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eka-francium===
The next element below [[francium]] is expected to be '''[[ununennium]]''' ('''Uue'''), element 119, although this is not certain. The synthesis of ununennium was attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of [[einsteinium]]-254 with [[calcium]]-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb.&lt;ref name=seaborg&gt;{{cite journal|title=Search for superheavy elements using &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca + &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; reaction|author=R.

 \ no\ atoms&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be useful given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of [[Isotopes of einsteinium|&lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es]] to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level, due to the rarity of the element, and extreme rarity of the isotope. However, given that ununennium is only the first [[period 8 element]] on the [[extended periodic table]], it may well be discovered in the near future. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet. It is also possible that, due to [[nucleon drip line|drip instabilities]], only the lower period 8 elements are physically possible.

Regardless of what the next element below francium actually is, it will still be known as ''[[Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[francium]]'', as it is below francium in the [[periodic table]].

Since the end of [[World War II]] lithium production has greatly increased. The metal is separated from other elements in [[igneous rock|igneous minerals]] such as those above. Lithium salts are extracted from the water of [[mineral springs]], [[brine]] pools and brine deposits. The metal is produced [[electrolysis|electrolytically]] from a mixture of fused [[lithium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ober&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450798.pdf |title=Lithium|accessdate = 2007-08-19|last=Ober |first=Joyce A |format=PDF |pages = 77–78| publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sodium===
Sodium was first produced commercially in 1855 by thermal reduction of [[sodium carbonate]] with [[carbon]] at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C, in what is known as the [[Deville process]].&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;Eggeman, Tim. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Published online '''2007'''. {{doi|10.1002/0471238961.1915040912051311.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (l) + 2 C (s) → 2 Na (g) + 3 CO (g)

A process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt; Sodium is now produced commercially through the [[electrolysis]] of liquid [[sodium chloride]], based on a process patented in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauling&quot;&gt;Pauling, Linus, ''General Chemistry'', 1970 ed., Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;losal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/11.html|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Sodium|accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in a [[Downs Cell]] in which the NaCl is mixed with [[calcium chloride]] to lower the [[melting point]] below 700&amp;nbsp;°C. As [[calcium]] is less [[electropositive]] than sodium, no calcium will be formed at the anode. This method is less expensive than the previous [[Castner process]] of electrolyzing [[sodium hydroxide]]. Very pure sodium can be isolated by the thermal decomposition of [[sodium azide]].&lt;ref&gt;Merck Index, 9th ed., monograph 8325&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potassium===
Pure potassium metal may be isolated by [[electrolysis]] of its [[potassium hydroxide|hydroxide]] in a process that has changed little since [[Humphry Davy|Davy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements potassium&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Webelements|title=Potassium: Key Information|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/K/key.html|author=Mark Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal methods also are employed in potassium production, using [[potassium chloride]].

Potassium salts such as [[carnallite]], [[langbeinite]], [[polyhalite]], [[potash]] and [[sylvite]] form extensive deposits in ancient lake and [[seabed]]s,{{cn|date=April 2011}} making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable.

===Rubidium===
Although rubidium is more abundant in Earth's crust than caesium the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 [[tonne]]s per year.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-045/of03-045.pdf |format = PDF|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2010-12-04|title = Mineral Commodity Profile: Rubidium|first1 = William C.|last1 = Butterman|first2 = William E.|last2 = Brooks|first3 = Robert G.|last3 = Reese, Jr.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The are several methods to separate potassium, rubidium and caesium.

For several years in the 1950s and 1960s a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Cesium and Rubidium Hit Market|journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume = 37|issue = 22|pages = 50|year = 1959|doi = 10.1021/cen-v037n022.p050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the  [[Tanco Mine]], Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from [[pollucite]].&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;&lt;!--
Rubidium metal can be produced by [[redox|reducing]] rubidium chloride with [[calcium]] among other methods. In 1997, the cost of this metal in small quantities was about [[US dollar|US$]]25/[[gram]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Caesium===
[[File:Pollucite(CesiumMineral)USGOV.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Pollucite]]
The mining of [[pollucite]] ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burt&gt;{{cite book|last = Burt|first = R.

==Occurrence==
===Lithium===
Although lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity.&lt;ref name=krebs /&gt; The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioes.saga-u.ac.jp/ioes-study/li/lithium/occurence.html |title=Lithium Occurrence|accessdate=2009-03-13|publisher=Institute of Ocean Energy, Saga University, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enclabs.com/lithium.html|accessdate=2010-10-15|title=Some Facts about Lithium|publisher=ENC Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 25 [[micromolar]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y621101m3567jku1/ |title=Extraction of metals from sea water|year=1984|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near [[hydrothermal vents]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

===Sodium===
Owing to its high reactivity, sodium is found in nature only as a compound and never as the free element. Sodium makes up about 2.6% by weight of the [[Earth]]'s crust, making it the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|sixth most abundant element]] overall&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most abundant alkali metal. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary [[salt]] (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater, as well as in solid deposits ([[halite]]). Others include [[amphibole]], [[cryolite]], [[soda niter]] and [[zeolite]].{{cn|date=April 2011}}

===Potassium===
Potassium does not occur as the free element in nature due to its reactivity, but in compounds, makes up 1.5% of the weight of [[Earth's crust]] and is the seventh most [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundant chemical element]].{{cn|date=April 2011}}

===Rubidium===
Rubidium is roughly as abundant as [[zinc]] and rather more common than [[copper]]. It occurs naturally in the minerals [[leucite]], [[pollucite]], [[carnallite]], [[zinnwaldite]] and [[lepidolite]].{{cn|date=April 2011}}

==Applications==
All of the alkali metals have very many applications, some of which are mentioned in the links below:
*[[Lithium#Applications|Lithium applications]]
*[[Sodium#Applications|Sodium applications]]
*[[Potassium#Applications|Potassium applications]]

==Biological occurrences==
[[File:Lithium carbonate.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lithium carbonate|Lithium carbonate]]
*[[Lithium]] has several biological effects. [[Lithium carbonate]] is used to treat [[bipolar disorder]] ([[manic-depression]]) disorders as it works as a mood stabiliser, although there are side effects, e.g. excessive ingestion of lithium [[poison]]s the [[central nervous system]], which is even more dangerous as the lethal dose is only just above the therapeutic dose. Lithium is present in the human body at about 30 [[ppb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/lithium/biology.html|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Lithium {{pipe}} biological information |publisher=WebElements |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sodium]] is an essential element for survival as its [[cation]], Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is important for [[nerve]] function. Sodium is present in the human body at about 0.14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/sodium/biology.html|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Sodium {{pipe}} biological information |publisher=WebElements |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Potassium]] is also an essential element for survival as its [[cation]], K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is essential for [[nerve]] and [[heart]] function. Potassium is present in the human body at about 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/potassium/biology.html|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Potassium {{pipe}} biological information |publisher=WebElements |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rubidium]] has no biological role but may help stimulate [[metabolism]], and can accumulate ahead of [[potassium]] in [[muscle]]. Rubidium is present in the body at about 4.6 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/rubidium/biology.html|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Rubidium {{pipe}} biological information |publisher=WebElements |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Caesium]] has no biological role, but can replace [[potassium]] to some extent in the body due to having similar chemical properties. Thus, caesium compounds should be avoided when possible, especially those containing [[radioisotope]]s of caesium, such as [[Caesium-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] and [[Caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]]. Rats fed caesium instead of potassium die. Caesium chloride (non-radioactive) has also promoted as an alternative cancer therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Sartori H. E. &quot;Cesium therapy in cancer patients.&quot; Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1984;21 Suppl 1:11-3.PMID: 6522427.&lt;/ref&gt; but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, when it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Leonie. {{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/lifematters/cured-cancer-patients-died-court-told-20101119-180z9.html |title='Cured' cancer patients died, court told |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium is present in the body at about 20 [[ppb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/caesium/biology.html|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Caesium {{pipe}} biological information |publisher=WebElements |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Francium]] has no biological role&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/francium/biology.html|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Francium {{pipe}} biological information |publisher=WebElements |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would most likely be extremely toxic due to its extreme [[radioactivity]]. If francium was not radioactive, based on [[periodic trend]]s it would most likely behave like caesium and would presumably be similarly toxic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Precautions==

The alkali metals all react with [[water]] ever more violently and thus should all be handled with great care. Of note is the toxicity of caesium because it replaces potassium, mentioned above. Also, francium's extreme radioactivity is a great hazard, although fortunately the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;mm (over 300,000 neutral atoms).&lt;ref name=chemnews&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/francium.html|title=Francium|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|year=2003|author=Luis A.

{{pp-move-indef}}[[File:Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg|thumb|300px|''A Specimen'' of [[typeset]] [[font]]s and [[language]]s, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]
{{Writing systems sidebar}}
An '''alphabet''' is a standardized set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]]—basic written symbols or [[graphemes]]—each of which roughly represents a [[phoneme]] in a [[spoken language]], either as it exists now or as it was in the past. There are other [[writing system|systems]], such as [[logograph]]ies, in which each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or semantic unit, and [[syllabary|syllabaries]], in which each character represents a [[syllable]]. Alphabets are classified according to how they indicate vowels:
* the same way as consonants, as in [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] (true alphabet)
* [[diacritic]]s or modification of consonants, as in [[Devanagari|Hindi (Devanāgarī: हिन्दी )]] ([[abugida]])
* not at all, as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] ([[abjad]])

The word &quot;alphabet&quot; came into [[Middle English]] from the [[Late Latin]] word '''Alphabetum''', which in turn originated in the [[Ancient Greek]] ''Αλφάβητος'' '''Alphabetos''', from ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha]]'' and ''[[beta (letter)|beta]],'' the first two letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=alphabet&amp;query=alphabet/ Encyclopædia Britannica Online&amp;nbsp;– Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha'' and ''beta'' in turn came from the first two letters of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and meant ''ox'' and ''house'' respectively and the first three letters of the Arabic language &quot;Alef, أ&quot;, &quot;Ba, ب&quot;, and &quot;Ta, ت&quot;. There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most common being [[Latin alphabet|Latin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from the first true alphabet, Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackwell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are composed of lines ([[linear writing]]); notable [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] are [[Braille]], [[fingerspelling]] ([[sign language]]), and [[Morse code]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the alphabet}}

===Middle Eastern Scripts===
[[File:Ba`alat.png|thumb|A specimen of [[Proto-Sinaitic script]], one of the earliest (if not the very first) phonemic scripts]]
The history of the alphabet started in [[ancient Egypt]]. By the 27th century BCE Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian uniliteral signs|24 hieroglyphs]] which are called uniliterals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2451890 |title=The Development of the Western Alphabet |accessdate=2008-08-04 |first=Gnomon |coauthors=Lynn, Bernadette |date=2004-04-08 |work=h2g2 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;Daniels and Bright (1996), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although seemingly alphabetic in nature, the original Egyptian uniliterals were not a system and were never used by themselves to encode Egyptian speech.&lt;ref name=Daniels/&gt; In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently &quot;alphabetic&quot; system known as the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] is thought by some to have been developed in the [[Sinai peninsula]] during the 19th century BCE, by Canaanite workers in the Egyptian turquoise mines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldwasser 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=36&amp;Issue=02&amp;ArticleID=06&amp;Page=0&amp;UserID=0&amp;|title=How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs |author=Goldwasser, O. |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |volume=36 |number=2 |date=March/April 2010 |pages=40–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest the alphabet was developed in central Egypt during the 15th century BCE for or by [[Semitic]] workers, but only one of these early writings has been deciphered and their exact nature remains open to interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas 140&quot;&gt;Coulmas (1989), p. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas 140&quot; /&gt; This script had no characters representing vowels. An alphabetic [[cuneiform]] script with 30 signs including three which indicate the following vowel was invented in [[Ugarit]] before the 15th century BCE. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.&lt;ref&gt;''Ugaritic Writing'' [http://www.mazzaroth.com/ChapterThree/UgariticWriting.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which is conventionally called &quot;Proto-Canaanite&quot; before ca. 1050 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels 9296&quot;/&gt; The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely [[Canaanite]] and [[Aramaic]]. The Aramaic gave rise to [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Coulmas&quot;(1989),p.142&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[South Arabian alphabet]], a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] (an [[abugida]]) is descended. Note that the scripts mentioned above are not considered proper alphabets, as they all lack characters representing vowels. These vowelless alphabets are called [[abjad]]s, currently exemplified in scripts including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. The omission of vowels was not a satisfactory solution and some &quot;weak&quot; consonants were used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable (matres lectionis). These had dual function since they were also used as pure consonants.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Coulmas&quot; (1989) p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Sinatic or Proto Canaanite script and the [[Ugaritic script]] were the first scripts with limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, [[Cuneiform]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and [[Linear B]]. The Phoenecian script was probably the first phonemic script&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas 140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels 9296&quot;&gt;Daniels and Bright (1996), pp 92-96&lt;/ref&gt; and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.

The script was spread by the Phoenicians, across the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels 9296&quot; /&gt; In Greece, the script was modified to add the vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The indication of the vowels is the same way as the indication of the consonants, therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks took letters which did not represent sounds that existed in Greek, and changed them to represent the vowels. The vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical [[Linear B]] script which was used by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greeks from the 16th century BCE had 87 symbols including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation which caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.

===European alphabets===
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Zographensis]] in the Glagolitic alphabet from Medieval [[Bulgaria]]]]
The [[Cumae alphabet|Cumae form]] of the Greek alphabet was carried over by Greek colonists from [[Euboea]] to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to inscribe the [[Italic languages]]. One of these became the [[Latin alphabet]], which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the [[Romance languages]]) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.

Another notable script is [[Elder Futhark]], which is believed to have evolved out of one of the [[Old Italic alphabet]]s. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the [[Runic alphabet]]s. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from CE 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage was mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.

The [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was the initial script of the liturgical language [[Old Church Slavonic]] and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]. The Cyrillic alphabet is one of the most widely used modern alphabets, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former Soviet Union. Variants include the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]], [[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]], and [[Russian alphabet]]s. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by the Bulgarian scholar [[Clement of Ohrid]], who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

===Asian alphabets===
Beyond the logographic [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The [[Arabic alphabet]], [[Hebrew alphabet]], [[Syriac alphabet]], and other [[abjad]]s of the Middle East are developments of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], but because these writing systems are largely [[consonant]]-based they are often not considered true alphabets.

Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the [[Brahmi script]], which is often believed to be a descendent of Aramaic.

In [[Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet was created by [[Sejong the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;上親制諺文二十八字…是謂訓民正音(His majesty created 28 characters himself... It is [[Hunminjeongeum]] (original name for [[Hangul]])&quot;, 《세종실록 (The Annals of the Choson Dynasty : Sejong)》 25년 12월.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1443. Understanding of the phonetic alphabet of Mongolian [[Phagspa script]] aided the creation of a phonetic script suited to the spoken Korean language.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Mongolian Phagspa script was in turn derived from the Brahmi script. Hangul is a unique alphabet in a variety of ways: it is a [[featural alphabet]], where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like widened mouth, L sound to look like tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the time; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as [[Chinese characters]], to allow for mixed script writing{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).

[[Zhuyin]] (sometimes called ''Bopomofo'') is a [[semi-syllabary]] used to phonetically transcribe [[Mandarin Chinese]] in the [[Republic of China]]. After the later establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] and its adoption of [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]], the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it's still widely used in [[Taiwan]] where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of [[syllable onset|syllable initials]] are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the [[syllable rime|syllable finals]] are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the [[medial (linguistics)|medial glide]]) is represented by its own symbol. For example, ''luan'' is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ (''l-u-an''), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final ''-an''. While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a [[romanization]] system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cell phones.

European alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] and [[Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]]).

{{alphabet}}

The term &quot;alphabet&quot; is used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[paleographer]]s in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is ''segmental'' at the [[phoneme]] level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish &quot;true&quot; alphabets from two other types of segmental script, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with [[diacritic]]s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters. The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Wadi el-Hol script]], believed to be an [[abjad]], which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]), [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] (via the Greek alphabet) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] (via [[Aramaic]]).

Examples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic]], and Korean [[hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant which is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)

All three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. [[Ugaritic script|Ugaritic]], for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ʔa, ʔi, ʔu/}}. (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ja, je, ju/}} (я, е, ю); [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] has a letter for {{IPA|/ti/}}. [[Devanagari]] is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a [[zero consonant]] as the graphic base for such vowels.

The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, [[Sorani]] [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Tigrinya abugida]] and the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Amharic abugida]] (ironically, the original source of the term &quot;abugida&quot;) have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a [[syllabary]] rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)

Thus the primary [[Categorisation|classification]] of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]], an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for [[Hmong pronunciation|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]]. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in [[Zhuyin]] not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the [[virama]] of Indic.

The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[Okina|ʻokina]] and five long vowels.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated''—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g, d, y, k,'' or ''j''. However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become [[logogram]]s as in Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]]. The alphabet in the Polish language contains 32 letters.

The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''kš'' and ''jñ,'' though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English.

The largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin alphabet]]), with 46. However, these scripts either count [[digraph (orthography)|di- and tri-graphs]] as separate letters, as Spanish did with ''ch'' and ''ll'' until recently, or uses [[diacritic]]s like Slovak ''č''. The largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], with 41 letters.

Syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs (though the [[Múra-Pirahã]] language of [[Brazil]] would require only 24 if it did not denote tone, and Rotokas would require only 30), and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

==Alphabetic order==
It is not always clear what constitutes a distinct alphabet. [[French language|French]] uses the same basic alphabet as English, but many of the letters can carry additional marks, such as é, à, and ô. In French, these combinations are not considered to be additional letters. However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters such as á, í, and ö are considered to be distinct letters of the alphabet. In Spanish, ñ is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as á and é are not. The ll and ch were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the [[Real Academia Española]] changed collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci, and in 2010 the tenth congress of the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]] changed it so they were no longer letters at all&lt;ref&gt;Real Academia Española. &quot;Spanish Pronto!: Spanish Alphabet.&quot; Spanish Pronto! 22 April 2007. January 2009 [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html#english Spanish Pronto: Spanish &lt; &gt; English Medical Translators.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;La “i griega” se llamará “ye”&quot;. Cuba Debate. 2010-11-05. Retrieved 12 December 2010. [http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2010/11/05/la-i-griega-se-llamara-ye-y-la-ch-y-la-ll-desaparecen-por-decreto-de-la-academia-espanola/ Cubadebate.cu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, words starting with ''sch-'' (constituting the German phoneme {{IPAslink|ʃ}}) would be intercalated between words with initial ''sca-'' and ''sci-'' (all incidentally loanwords) instead of this graphic cluster appearing after the letter '''s''', as though it were a single letter—a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] policy which would be de rigueur in a dictionary of [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]], i.e. ''dh-'', ''gj-'', ''ll-'', ''rr-'', ''th-'', ''xh-'' and ''zh-'' (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters '''d''', '''g''', '''l''', '''n''', '''r''', '''t''', '''x''' and '''z''' respectively. Nor is, in a dictionary of English, the lexical section with initial ''th-'' reserved a place after the letter '''t''', but is inserted between ''te-'' and ''ti-''. German words with [[umlaut]] would further be alphabetized as if there were no umlaut at all—contrary to [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] which allegedly adopted the [[German alphabet|German]] [[grapheme]]s '''ö''' and '''ü''', and where a word like tüfek, &quot;gun&quot;, would come after tuz, &quot;salt&quot;, in the dictionary.

The [[Danish and Norwegian alphabet]]s end with '''æ'''—'''ø'''—'''å''', whereas the Swedish, Finnish and Estonian ones conventionally put '''å'''—'''ä'''—'''ö''' at the end.

Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[æ]] in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Ou (letter)|Ȣ]] in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] þ in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Runic alphabet|Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and [[Italian language|Italian]], which uses the letters ''j, k, x, y'' and ''w'' only in foreign words.

It is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the [[Hanuno'o script]], are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for [[collation]] where a definite order is required. However, a dozen [[Ugaritic alphabet|Ugaritic]] tablets from the fourteenth century BCE preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the ''ABCDE'' order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]; the other, ''HMĦLQ,'' was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]].&lt;ref&gt;Millard, A.R. &quot;The Infancy of the Alphabet&quot;, ''World Archaeology'' 17, No. 3, Early Writing Systems (February 1986): 390–398. page 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.

The historical order was abandoned in [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], although Arabic retains the traditional &quot;[[abjadi order]]&quot; for numbering.

The [[Brahmic family]] of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on [[phonology]]: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean [[hangul]], and even Japanese [[kana]], which is not an alphabet.

The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter is associated with a word that begins with that sound, continue to be used in [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]. However, they were abandoned in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]].

==Orthography and spelling==
{{Main|Orthography|Spelling}}
Each language may establish rules that govern the association between letters and phonemes, but, depending on the language, these rules may or may not be consistently followed. In a perfectly [[phonology|phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.

However, the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:
* A language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s. [[German language|German]] uses the tesseragraphs (four letters) &quot;tsch&quot; for the phoneme {{IPA-de|tʃ|}} and &quot;dsch&quot; for {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, although the latter is rare. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] also uses a tesseragraph for one of its phonemes.
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters. An example is [[modern Greek]] which may write the phoneme {{IPA-el|i|}} in six different ways: ‹ι›, ‹η›, ‹υ›, ‹ει›, ‹οι›, and ‹υι› (although the last is very rare).
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons. For example, the spelling of the Thai word for &quot;beer&quot; [เบียร์] retains a letter for the final consonant &quot;r&quot; present in the English word it was borrowed from, but silences it. Otherwise, according to Thai pronunciation rules, the word might be pronounced more like &quot;bean&quot;.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence ([[sandhi]]).
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items, such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, there is no word in the Finnish, Turkish and Bulgarian languages corresponding to the verb &quot;to spell&quot; (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never needed: each phoneme of Standard Italian is represented in only one way. However, pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling in cases of irregular syllabic stress. In standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa; this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.

At the other extreme, are languages such as English, where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a [[spelling reform]] to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when [[Turkey]] switched from the Arabic alphabet to the Roman alphabet.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{See also|List of elements by atomic number}}
In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], the '''atomic number''' (also known as the '''proton number''') is the number of [[proton]]s found in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]] and therefore identical to the [[charge number]] of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol '''''Z'''''. The atomic number uniquely identifies a [[chemical element]]. In an atom of [[electric charge|neutral charge]], the atomic number is also equal to the number of [[electron]]s.

The atomic number, ''Z'', should not be confused with the [[mass number]], ''A'', which is the total number of protons and [[neutron]]s in the nucleus of an atom. The number of neutrons, ''N'', is known as the [[neutron number]] of the atom; thus, ''A'' = ''Z'' + ''N''. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is [[negligible]] for many purposes), and the [[mass defect]] is usually very small compared to the mass, the [[atomic mass]] of an atom is roughly equal to ''A''.

Atoms having the same atomic number ''Z'' but different neutron number ''N'', and hence different atomic mass, are known as [[isotope]]s. Most naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, and the average atomic mass of this mixture determines the element's [[atomic weight]].

==History==
Loosely speaking, the existence of a [[periodic table]] creates an ordering for the elements. Such an ordering is not necessarily a numbering, but can be used to construct a numbering by fiat.
[[Dmitri Mendeleev]] claimed he arranged his tables in order of [[atomic weight]] (&quot;Atomgewicht&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;dm1869&quot;&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/curie/periodic.htm The Periodic Table of Elements] , American Institute of Physics&lt;/ref&gt; However, in deference to the observed chemical properties, he violated his own rule and placed [[tellurium]] (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of [[iodine]] (atomic weight 126.9).&lt;ref name=&quot;dm1869&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/pages/history_ii.html The Development of the Periodic Table], Chemsoc&lt;/ref&gt; This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, ''Z'', but this number was not known or suspected at the time.

A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory. Besides iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, leaving their placement in the periodic table by chemical properties to be in violation of known physical properties. Another problem was that the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar and indistinguishable [[lanthanide]]s, which were of an uncertain number, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the numbering of all elements at least from [[lutetium]] (element 71) onwards ([[hafnium]] was not known at this time).

In 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] gave a [[Rutherford model|model]] of the atom in which a central core held most of the atom's mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms. This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% off the figure for the atomic number in gold (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;79, ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;197), the single element from which Rutherford made his guess). Nevertheless, in spite of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element Z = 79 on the periodic table), a month after Rutherford's paper appeared, [[Antonius van den Broek]] first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was ''exactly'' equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized ''Z''). This proved eventually to be the case.

The experimental situation improved dramatically after research by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/periodictable/pre16/order.doc Ordering the Elements in the Periodic Table], Royal Chemical Society&lt;/ref&gt; Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fit the Bohr theory's demand that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to a measure of the square of ''Z''.

To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13) to gold (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an [[x-ray tube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemistry.co.nz/henry_moseley_article.htm Moseley's paper with illustrations]&lt;/ref&gt; The square root of the frequency of these photons (x-rays) increased from one target to the next in a linear fashion. This led to the conclusion ([[Moseley's law]]) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated [[electric charge]] of the nucleus, i.e. the proton number ''Z''. Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the [[lanthanide]] series (from [[lanthanum]] to [[lutetium]] inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time.

The conventional symbol ''Z'' presumably comes from the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|''Atom&lt;u&gt;'''z'''&lt;/u&gt;ahl''}} (atomic number).&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/atoms/faq/why-is-atomic-number-Z.shtml Origin of symbol Z]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom, which is ''Z''. The [[electron configuration|configuration]] of these electrons follows from the principles of [[quantum mechanics]]. The number of electrons in each element's [[electron shell]]s, particularly the outermost [[valence shell]], is the primary factor in determining its [[chemical bonding]] behavior. Hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of ''any'' mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.

==New elements==
The quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers. As of 2010, elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed. Synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions, such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created. In general, the [[half-life]] becomes shorter as atomic number increases, though an &quot;[[island of stability]]&quot; may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons.

'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ἀνατομία}} anatomia'', from '' {{polytonic|ἀνατέμνειν}} ana: separate, apart from, and temnein'', to cut up, cut open) is a branch of [[biology]] and [[medicine]] that is the consideration of the [[body plan|structure of living things]]. It is a general term that includes [[human anatomy]], animal anatomy (zootomy) and [[plant anatomy]] (phytotomy). In some of its facets anatomy is closely related to [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]] and [[Phylogenetics|comparative embryology]],&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;. Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate = 19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; through common roots in [[evolution]].

Anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy (or macroscopic anatomy) and microscopic anatomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; Gross anatomy (also called topographical anatomy, regional anatomy, or anthropotomy) is the study of anatomical structures that can be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures assisted with [[microscope]]s, which includes [[histology]] (the study of the organization of tissues),&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; and [[Cell biology|cytology]] (the study of cells).

The [[history of anatomy]] has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and structures in the body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of [[animal]]s through dissection of [[cadaver]]s (dead human bodies) to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century including X-ray, ultrasound, and MRI imaging.

Anatomy should not be confused with [[anatomical pathology]] (also called morbid anatomy or [[histopathology]]), which is the study of the gross and microscopic appearances of [[disease]]d [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.

== Superficial anatomy ==
[[Superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy is important in anatomy being the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the contours or the surface of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot;/&gt; With knowledge of superficial anatomy, [[physician]]s or [[veterinary surgeon]]s gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.
Superficial is a directional term that indicates one structure is located more externally than another, or closer to the surface of the body.

== Human anatomy ==

[[File:Chest.png|thumb|150px|An [[X-ray]] of a human [[chest]].]]
[[File:Heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|150px|Human heart and lungs, from an older edition of ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]''.]]

Human anatomy, including gross [[human anatomy]] and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the adult [[human]] body.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy]], [[nurse]]s, and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]]; and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy with practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of cadavers (dead human bodies).

[[Human anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically;&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, [[Gray's Anatomy]], has recently been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format,&lt;!--

A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by all [[Physician|medical doctors]], especially [[surgery|surgeons]], and doctors working in some diagnostic specialities, such as [[histopathology]] and [[radiology]].

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

== Other branches ==
*[[Comparative anatomy]] relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;
*Anthropological anatomy or physical anthropology relates to the comparison of the anatomy of different [[race (classification of human beings)|race]]s of humans.
*Artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons.

'''Affirming the consequent''', sometimes called '''converse error''', is a [[formal fallacy]], committed by reasoning in the [[argument form|form]]:

#If ''P'', then ''Q''.
#''Q''.
#Therefore, ''P''.

An argument of this form is [[validity|invalid]], i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.  Since ''P'' was never asserted as the ''only'' sufficient condition for ''Q'', other factors could account for ''Q'' (while ''P'' was false).

The name ''affirming the consequent'' derives from the premise ''Q'', which affirms [[consequent|the &quot;then&quot; clause]] of the [[indicative conditional|conditional]] premise.

==Examples==
One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion.  For example:

:If [[Bill Gates]] owns [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]], then he is rich.
:Bill Gates is rich.
:Therefore, Bill Gates owns Fort Knox.

Owning Fort Knox is not the ''only'' way to be rich.  There are any number of other ways to be rich.

Arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example:

:If I have the [[flu]], then I have a [[sore throat]].
:I have a sore throat.
:Therefore, I have the flu.

But having the flu is not the ''only'' cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the [[common cold]] or [[strep throat]].

The following is a more subtle version of the fallacy embedded into conversation.

:A: All [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] are [[gun control|against gun control]].
:B: That's not true. My uncle's against gun control and he's not a Republican.

B attempts to falsify A's [[Logical conditional|conditional]] statement (&quot;if Republican then against gun control&quot;) by providing evidence he believes would contradict its implication.  However, B's example of his uncle does not contradict A's statement, which says nothing about non-Republicans.  What would be needed to disprove A's assertion are examples of Republicans who support gun control. If this refutation is then followed by A asserting that all ''true'' Republicans are against gun control, it would be a case of ''[[No True Scotsman]]'' fallacy.

'''Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Арсеньевич Тарковский}}; April 4, 1932–December 29, 1986) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] [[filmmaker]], writer, film editor, [[film theory|film theorist]] and opera director, widely regarded as one of the finest filmmakers of the 20th century.

Tarkovsky's films include ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', and ''[[Stalker (film)|Stalker]]''. He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]]; his last two films were produced in [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and [[Cinema of Sweden|Sweden]], respectively. They are characterized by spirituality and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, long takes, lack of conventional dramatic structure and plot, and distinctively authored use of cinematography.

Notable film director [[Ingmar Bergman]] said of Tarkovsky:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Title quote of 2003 Tarkovsky Festival Program, Pacific Film Archive&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|''&quot;Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [director], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.&quot;''}}

==Life==
===Childhood and early life===
Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in [[Ivanovo Oblast]], the son of poet and translator [[Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky]], native of [[Kirovohrad]], [[Ukraine]], and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]].

Tarkovsky spent his childhood in [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marina |last=Sipatova |title=Тайна рода Тарковских |work=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.mk.ru/blogs/MK/2007/02/20/culture/92002 |language=Russian|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action. In 1937, his father left the family, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939, Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554. During the war, the three evacuated to [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943, the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet [[Andrey Voznesensky]] was one of his classmates. He learned the piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on Shshipok Street in the [[Zamoskvorechye District]] in Moscow. From November 1947 to spring 1948, he was in a hospital with [[tuberculosis]]. Many themes of his childhood - the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital - feature prominently in his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]''.

Following high school graduation, from 1951 to 1952, Tarkovsky studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. Although he already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters, he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the Academy of Science Institute for Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold. He participated in a year-long research expedition to the river Kureikye near [[Turukhansk]] in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai|Krasnoyarsk Province]]. During this time in the [[Taiga]] Tarkovsky decided to study film.

===Film school student===
[[Image:The killers Tarkovsky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Andrei Tarkovsky in his student film ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'']]
Upon return from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]] (VGIK) and was admitted to the film-directing-program. He was in the same class as [[Irma Raush]], whom he married in April 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;kompravda&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Anastasia | last=Pleshakova |title=Тарковский был &quot;разрешенным контрреволюционером&quot; |trans_title= Tarkovsky was &quot;a legal сounterrevolutionary&quot;|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=April 4, 2007 |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23881/65502/ |accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] era offered unique opportunities for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] opened Soviet society and allowed, to some degree, Western literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Buñuel|Buñuel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]],
[[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film [[Ashes and Diamonds]] was a true experience for him) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]]. Tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the [[auteur theory|auteur]] as a necessary condition for creativity.

[[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]]
Tarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956, Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the screenplay ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.

An important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigori Chukhrai]], who was teaching at the VGIK. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhrai offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest, but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;kompravda&quot; /&gt;

During his third year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959, they wrote the script ''Antarctica - Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], which was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This film became Tarkovsky's diploma film, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning first prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.

==Career==
===Film career in the Soviet Union===
Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1962. In the same year, on September 30, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.

In 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the 15th century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. A version of the film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1969 and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]]. The film was officially released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971.

He divorced his wife, [[Irma Raush]], in June 1970. In the same year, he married [[Larisa Tarkovskaya|Larissa Kizilova]] ([[née]] Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film ''Andrei Rublev'' (they had been living together since 1965). Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, was born in the same year on August 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gianvito | first=John | authorlink=John Gianvito | coauthors= | title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews ([[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]) | year=2006 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | location= | isbn=1-57806-220-9 | pages=XXV}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he completed ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', an adaptation of the novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' by [[Stanisław Lem]]. He had worked on this together with screenwriter Fridrikh Gorenshtein, as early as 1968. The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the &quot;third category&quot; which meant severe limitations on its distribution, allowing it to be shown only in third class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the filmmakers received no returns. Third category films also placed the filmmakers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Herbert. ''Sight and Sound''. Vol 45, no 2. Spring 1976. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During 1975, Tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay ''[[Hoffmanniana]]'', about the German writer and poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.

The last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''[[Roadside Picnic|Roadside picnic]]''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where Tarkovsky hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: Pervyy Dyen), based on a script by his friend and longterm collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]] in the main roles. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, leaving out several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After finishing shooting of roughly one half of the film, the project was stopped by Goskino, after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Film career outside the Soviet Union===
[[Image:Gravestone of Andrei Tarkovsky 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Andrei and Larisa Tarkovsky's grave, [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]] in France.]]
During the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'', together with his longtime friend [[Tonino Guerra]]. Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and Tonino Guerra completed the script for the film ''[[Nostalghia]]''. During 1981 he traveled to the United Kingdom and Sweden. During his trip to Sweden he had considered defecting from the Soviet Union, but ultimately decided to return because of his wife and his son.

Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1982 to start shooting ''[[Nostalghia]]''. He did not return to his home country. As [[Mosfilm]] withdrew from the project, he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian [[RAI]]. Tarkovsky completed the film in 1983. ''[[Nostalghia]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called ''Grand Prix du cinéma de creation'' with [[Robert Bresson]]. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the [[Palme d'Or]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagstaff2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that hardened Tarkovsky's resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again. In the same year, he also arranged the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London under the musical direction of [[Claudio Abbado]].

He spent most of 1984 preparing the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]''. At a press conference in [[Milan]] on July 10, 1984, he announced that he would never return to the Soviet Union and would remain in the West. At that time, his son Andrei Jr. was still in the Soviet Union and not allowed to leave the country.

During 1985, he shot the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' in Sweden. At the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]]. In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris, and was joined there by his son, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union. ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]], the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. As Tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness, the prizes were collected by his son, Andrei Jr.

In Tarkovsky's last [[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|diary]] entry (December 15, 1986), he wrote: &quot;But now I have no strength left - that is the problem&quot;. The diaries are sometimes also known as ''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|Martyrolog]]'' and were published posthumously in 1989 and in English in 1991.

Tarkovsky died in Paris on December 29, 1986. He was buried on January 3, 1987 in the [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery|Russian Cemetery]] in [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois]] in France. The inscription on his grave stone, which was created by the Russian sculptor [[Ernst Neizvestny]], reads: ''To the man who saw the Angel''.

A controversy emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes, but was assassinated by the [[KGB]]. Evidence for this hypothesis includes several testimonies by former KGB agents, who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to prevent what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memos that surfaced after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup]] and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.&lt;ref&gt;Komsolmoskaya Pravda, &quot;New Tarkovsky documents surface&quot;, 15. September 1995, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tarkovsky, his wife [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]] and actor [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]] all died from the very same type of lung cancer, Vladimir Sharun, sound designer in ''[[Stalker (film)|Stalker]]'', is convinced that they were all poisoned when shooting the film near a chemical plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tyrkin |first=Stas |title=In Stalker Tarkovsky foretold Chernobyl |journal=Komsomolskaya Pravda |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html |date=23 March 2001 |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmography===
{{main|Andrei Tarkovsky filmography}}
Tarkovsky is mainly known as a director of films. During his career he directed only seven feature films, and three short films during his time at the film school. He also wrote several screenplays, directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting In Time]]'', a book on film theory.

Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed in the Soviet Union ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a co-writer. To Tarkovsky a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiają Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137–160 |location=Warsaw |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
{{main|List of awards won by Andrei Tarkovsky}}
Numerous awards were bestowed on Tarkovsky throughout his lifetime. At the [[Venice Film Festival]] he was awarded the ''[[Golden Lion]]''. At the [[Cannes Film Festival]] he won several times the ''[[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]]'', the ''[[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]]'' and the ''[[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]]''. He was also nominated for the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' two times. In 1987, the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] awarded the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film#1980s|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] to ''[[The Sacrifice]]''.

Under the influence of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], Tarkovsky was finally recognized in the Soviet Union in the fall of 1986, shortly before his death, by a retrospective of his films in Moscow. After his death, an entire issue of the film magazine ''Iskusstvo Kino'' was devoted to Tarkovsky. In their obituaries, the film committee of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] and the Union of Soviet Film Makers expressed their sorrow that Tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |publisher=[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]] |date=1987-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumously, he was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1990, one of the highest state honors in the Soviet Union. In 1989 the ''Andrei Tarkovsky Memorial Prize'' was established, with its first recipient being the Russian animator [[Yuriy Norshteyn]]. Since 1993, the [[Moscow International Film Festival]] awards the annual ''Andrei Tarkovsky Award''. In 1996 the Andrei Tarkovsky Museum opened in [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], his childhood town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=МУЗЕЙ А.ТАРКОВСКОГО |url=http://www.museum.ru/tarkovsky |accessdate=2007-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[minor planet]], [[3345 Tarkovskij]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina]] in 1982, has also been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmadel |first=Lutz |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |url=http://books.google.com/books?q=3345+tarkovskij |isbn=3-54-000238-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 documentary ''[[Moscow Elegy]]'', by Russian film director [[Alexander Sokurov]]. Sokurov's own work has been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky. The film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films. ''Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky'' is 1988 documentary film by [[Michal Leszczylowski]], an editor of the film ''The Sacrifice''. Film director [[Chris Marker]] produced the television documentary ''[[One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich]]'' as an homage to Andrei Tarkovsky in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Significant Documentaries |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheDocumentaries/Documentaries.html |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ingmar Bergman]] was quoted as saying: &quot;Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [of us all], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Film historian [[Steven Dillon]] claims that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of Tarkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Steven|title=The Solaris Effect: Art and Artifice in Contemporary American Film|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780292713451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the enterance to the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in [[Moscow, Russia]] there is a monument that includes statues of Tarkovsky, [[Gennady Shpalikov]] and [[Vasily Shukshin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panoramio.com/photo/26383277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.

Tarkovsky was, according to Shavkat Abdusalmov, a fellow student at the film school, fascinated by Japanese films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abdusalamov |first=Shavkat |coauthors=translated by Sergei Sossinsky |title=Feedback Effects, in About Andrei Tarkovsky, Memoirs and Biographies |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1990 |location=Moscow |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |isbn=5-01-001973-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of Haiku and its ability to create &quot;images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tarkovsky, Andrei. Sculpting in Time. Trans. Kitty Hunter-Blair. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Tarkovsky told film historian [[Leonid Kozlov]] his ten favorite films. The list includes: ''[[Diary of a Country Priest]]'' and ''[[Mouchette]]'', by [[Robert Bresson]]; ''[[Winter Light]]'', ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' and ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'', by [[Ingmar Bergman]]; ''[[Nazarín]]'', by [[Luis Buñuel]]; ''[[City Lights]]'', by [[Charlie Chaplin]]; ''[[Ugetsu]]'', by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]; ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', by [[Akira Kurosawa]], and ''[[Woman in the Dunes]]'', by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]]. Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean Vigo]], and [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasica |first=Tom |title=Tarkovsky's Choice |journal=Sight and Sound |volume=3 |issue=3 |month=March | year=1993 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html |accessdate=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of ''City Lights'', the list does not contain any films of the early silent era. The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as [[Boris Barnet]], [[Sergei Paradjanov]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] highly.

Although strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying its &quot;vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art&quot;. He was critical of the &quot;brutality and low acting skills&quot;, but nevertheless impressed by this film.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;

==Cinematic style==
Tarkovsky's films are characterised by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and memorable images of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said, “Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.”

Tarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=de Brantes |first=Charles |title=La foi est la seule chose qui puisse sauver l'homme |newspaper=La France Catholique |date=June 20, 1986 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for its surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as its symbolism, such as waves or the form of brooks or running water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=English Programme Booklet for ''The Sacrifice'' |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self reflection.

Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot;sculpting in time&quot;. By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.

Up to, and including, his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''The Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.

Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences, including for example ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' which features an epilogue in color of religious icon paintings, as well as ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', and ''Stalker'', which feature monochrome and [[Sepia tone|sepia]] sequences while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a &quot;commercial gimmick&quot; and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time. Hence in film color should be used mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color are like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema - Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |month=December | year=1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vadim Yusov===
Tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer [[Vadim Yusov]], and much of the visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;List Of Noted Film Director And Cinematographer Collaborations: Andrei Tarkovsky Vadim Yusov, Museum of Learning, [http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/List_of_noted_film_director_and_cinematographer_collaborations::sub::Andrei_Tarkovsky_Vadim_Yusov]&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for Yusov to film a single long take, and due to the preparation, usually only a single take was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79&quot;&gt;The films of Andrei Tarkovsky: a visual fugue By Vida T. Johnson, Graham Petrie, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sven Nykvist===
In his last film, ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]], who had worked closely with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] on many of Bergman's films. Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Alice 05a-1116x1492.jpg|thumb|250px|Sir [[John Tenniel]]'s illustration of the [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]] for [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]] is noted for its ambiguous central figure, whose head can be viewed as being a human male's face with a pointed nose and pointy chin or being the head end of an actual [[caterpillar]], with the right three &quot;true&quot; legs visible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And do you see its long nose and chin? At least, they ''look'' exactly like a nose and chin, that is don't they? But they really ''are'' two of its legs. You know a Caterpillar has got ''quantities'' of legs: you can see more of them, further down.&quot; Carroll, Lewis. ''The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;''. Dover Publications (1966), p27.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Ambiguity''' is a term used in writing and math, and under conditions where information can be understood or interpreted in more than one way and is distinct from [[vagueness]], which is a statement about the lack of precision contained or available in the information.

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

== Linguistic forms ==
The [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase contains in its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. &quot;Meaning&quot; hereby refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word &quot;[[Bank (disambiguation)|bank]]&quot; has several distinct lexical definitions, including &quot;[[Bank|financial institution]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]&quot;. Another example is as in [[apothecary]]. One could say &quot;I bought herbs from the apothecary&quot;. This could mean you actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says &quot;I deposited $100 in the bank&quot;, most people would not think you used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word. For example, &quot;Biweekly&quot; can mean &quot;fortnightly&quot; (once every two weeks – 26 times a year), OR &quot;twice a week&quot; (104 times a year). If &quot;biweekly&quot; is used in a conversation about a meeting schedule, it may be difficult to infer which meaning was intended.
Many people{{Who|date=April 2009}} believe that such lexically ambiguous, miscommunication-prone words should be avoided wherever possible, since the user generally has to waste time, effort, and [[attention span]] to define what is meant when they are used.

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[Word Sense Disambiguation]].

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose &quot;[[weasel word]]s&quot; and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Constituent (politics)|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. “Good,” for example, can mean &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; (''That’s a good hammer''), &quot;exemplary&quot; (''She’s a good student''), &quot;pleasing&quot; (''This is good soup''), &quot;moral (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), &quot;[[righteous]]&quot;, etc. &quot; I have a good daughter&quot; is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity (&quot;unlockable&quot; can mean &quot;capable of being unlocked&quot; or &quot;impossible to lock&quot;).

[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a phrase can be [[parsing|parsed]] in more than one way. Such phrases can be assigned different interpretations because different grammatical structures can be assigned to the same string of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kroeger|first=Paul|title=Analysing Grammar: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-01653-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He ate the cookies on the couch&quot;, for example, could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.

[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words, for example &quot;ice cream&quot; and &quot;I scream&quot;. Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].

[[Meaning (linguistic)|Semantic ambiguity]] arises when a word or concept has an inherently diffuse meaning based on widespread or informal usage. This is often the case, for example, with idiomatic expressions whose definitions are rarely or never well-defined, and are presented in the context of a larger argument that invites a conclusion.

For example, &quot;You could do with a new automobile. How about a test drive?&quot; The clause &quot;You could do with&quot; presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].

Linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law (see [[Ambiguity (law)]]), because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

==Intentional application==
[[Philosopher]]s (and other users of [[logic]]) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments, because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say &quot;I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth&quot;, an example of a [[glittering generality]]. Some will think he opposes taxes in general, because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after &quot;taxes&quot; (to convey the first sense) or by changing &quot;which&quot; to &quot;that&quot; (to convey the second sense), or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each [[constituent (politics)]] will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true - An opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one, if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of [[amphiboly]] and [[equivocation]] rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[Continental philosophy]] (particularly [[phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]]), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. [[Martin Heidegger]] argued that the relation between the [[subject-object problem|subject and object]] is ambiguous, as is the relation of [[mind and body]], and [[mereology|part and whole]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. &quot;[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]&quot;. Poetry, Language, Thought. Trans. Albert Hofstadter. NY: Harper Collins, 1971, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In Heidegger's phenomenology, [[Dasein]] is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signfication. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of ''care'' and [[existential anxiety]], e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work [[Being and Nothingness]] an &quot;essay in phenomenological ontology&quot; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings ([[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: &quot;as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued thre same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone. ''The Ethics of Ambiguity.'' Trans. Bernard Frechtman. New York: Citadel Press, 1976 [1948], pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: &quot;Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us therefore try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, ''Ethics,'' pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The History of Sexuality, An Introduction (Vol. 1). Trans Robert Hurley. New York: Vintage Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not in fact separate.&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Corey. ''Sources of Significance: Worldly Rejuvenation and Neo-Stoic Heroism.'' West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2010, pg. 35-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Ernest Becker]], he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous [[ideologies]] and historical events such as [[genocide]]. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Corey. &quot;Authoritative Disambiguation&quot;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxNR3aOL8l4]. Professoranton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]] and [[rhetoric]], ambiguity can be a useful tool. [[Groucho Marx]]’s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its [[humor]], for example: &quot;Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I’ll never know&quot;. Ambiguity can also be used as a comic device through a genuine intention to confuse, as does Magic: The Gathering's Unhinged © Ambiguity, which makes puns with [[homophone]]s, mispunctuation, and run-ons: &quot;Whenever a player plays a spell that counters a spell that has been played[,] or a player plays a spell that comes into play with counters, that player may counter the next spell played[,] or put an additional counter on a permanent that has already been played, but not countered&quot;. Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title &quot;Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; (where &quot;blue&quot; can refer to the color, or to [[sadness]]).

In narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

All [[religions]] debate the [[orthodoxy]] or [[heterodoxy]] of ambiguity. [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] employ the concept of [[paradox]] synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Ambiguity within Christianity&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/9018.htm Living With Ambiguity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (and other religions) is resisted by the conservatives and fundamentalists, who regard the concept as equating with 'contradiction'. Non-fundamentalist Christians and Jews endorse [[Rudolf Otto]]'s description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.

[[Metonymy]] involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or [[jargon]], for the name of the whole object (for example &quot;wheels&quot; to refer to a car, or &quot;flowers&quot; to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern [[vocabulary]] critical [[semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/epc/srb/cyber/sim8.html CSI: Sim8&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual [[contiguity]] (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as &quot;sweet ride&quot; to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.&lt;ref&gt;Veale, Tony (2003): &quot;Metaphor and Metonymy: The Cognitive Trump-Cards of Linguistic Humor&quot;[http://afflatus.ucd.ie/Papers/iclc2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology and management===
In sociology and social psychology, the term &quot;ambiguity&quot; is used to indicate situations that involve [[uncertainty]]. An increasing amount of research is concentrating on how people react and respond to ambiguous situations. Much of this focuses on [[ambiguity tolerance]]. A number of correlations have been found between an individual’s reaction and tolerance to ambiguity and a range of factors.

Apter and Desselles (2001)&lt;ref&gt;in Motivational Styles in Everyday life: A guide to reversal Theory. M.J. Apter (ed) (2001) APA Books&lt;/ref&gt; for example, found a strong correlation with such attributes and factors like a greater preference for safe as opposed to risk-based sports, a preference for endurance-type activities as opposed to explosive activities, a more organized and less casual lifestyle, greater care and precision in descriptions, a lower sensitivity to emotional and unpleasant words, a less acute sense of humor, engaging a smaller variety of sexual practices than their more risk-comfortable colleagues, a lower likelihood of the use of drugs, pornography and drink, a greater likelihood of displaying obsessional behavior.

In the field of [[leadership]] [[David Wilkinson (ambiguity expert)|David Wilkinson]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, D.J. (2006) The Ambiguity Advantage: What great leaders are great at. New York Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; found strong correlations between an individual leader's reaction to ambiguous situations and the [[Modes of Leadership]] they use, the type of [[creativity]], Kirton (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Kirton, M.J. (2003)Adaption-Innovation: In the Context of Diversity and Change. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and how they relate to others.

==Music==
In [[music]], pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote [[Donald Francis Tovey|Sir Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.&amp;nbsp;195), “Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.”

== Visual art ==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image.|thumb]]
In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the [[Necker cube]], which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called [[multistable perception]].
The opposite of such ambiguous images are [[impossible object]]s.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

==Constructed language==
Some [[Conlang|languages have been created]] with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]]. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two related languages which have been created with this in mind, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to [[syntax]] and [[semantic]] rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

==Mathematical notation==
[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.

===Names of functions===
The '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument and/or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:
* [[Sinc function]]
* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the Third Kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List_of_notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.
* [[Exponential integral]],&lt;ref name=&quot;irene&quot;&gt;M.Abramovits, I.Stegun. Handbook on mathematical functions&lt;/ref&gt; page 228 http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm
* [[Hermite polynomial]],&lt;ref name=&quot;irene&quot; /&gt; page 775 http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_775.htm

===Expressions===
Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common, to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, &lt;math&gt;~f=f(x)~&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if one sees &lt;math&gt;~f=f(y+1)~&lt;/math&gt;, there is no way to distinguish, does it mean &lt;math&gt;~f=f(x)~&lt;/math&gt; '''multiplied''' by &lt;math&gt;~(y+1)~&lt;/math&gt;, or function &lt;math&gt;~f~&lt;/math&gt; '''evaluated''' at argument equal to &lt;math&gt;~(y+1)~&lt;/math&gt;. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]], [[MATLAB]], [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The language [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, &lt;math&gt;~a/bc~&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;~a/(bc)~&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
Sometimes, one uses ''italics'' letters to denote elementary functions.
In the [[scientific journal]] style, the expression
&lt;math&gt;~ s i n \alpha~&lt;/math&gt;
means
product of variables
&lt;math&gt;~s~&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;~i~&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;~\alpha~&lt;/math&gt;, although in a slideshow, it may mean &lt;math&gt;~\sin[\alpha]~&lt;/math&gt;.

Comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
If it is written &lt;math&gt;~T_{mnk}~&lt;/math&gt;, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables
&lt;math&gt;~m~&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~k~&lt;/math&gt;, or it is indication to a three-valent tensor.
The writing of &lt;math&gt;~T_{mnk}~&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;~T_{m,n,k}~&lt;/math&gt; may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees, or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in &lt;math&gt;F_{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Some scientific journals use superscripts to indicate citations. If one cites reference number 6 about [[coherent addition of lasers]], the centenve may read as follows:
Practically, the number of lasers, which can be combined in such a way, does not exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
&quot;Oh, this very powerful method allows for the combination of a million lasers,&quot;
the reader may think. To avoid such ambiguitty, [[citations]] in wikipedia appear inside square bracket &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.
!--&gt;

===Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, which could be understood to mean either &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha/2))^2\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^2/2\,&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin(\sin(x))&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\exp^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(x))&lt;/math&gt; (see [[tetration]]).

&lt;math&gt;~\sin^{-1} \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which by convention means &lt;math&gt;~\arcsin(\alpha) ~&lt;/math&gt;, though it might be thought to mean &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;~\sin^{n} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a/2b\,&lt;/math&gt;, which arguably should mean &lt;math&gt;(a/2)b\,&lt;/math&gt; but would commonly be understood to mean &lt;math&gt;a/(2b)\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics===
It is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with &lt;math&gt;~|\alpha\rangle~ &lt;/math&gt; and states with fixed number of photons with &lt;math&gt;~|n\rangle~&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an &quot;unwritten rule&quot;: the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and &lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt;photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if &lt;math&gt;~|x\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and &lt;math&gt;~|p\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easy lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression &lt;math&gt; |1\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

===Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics===
Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]) depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: &quot;... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly confusing term is ''[[gain]]''. For example, the sentence &quot;the gain of a system should be doubled&quot;, without context, means close to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also [[Accuracy and precision]] and its talk.

The [[Berry paradox]] arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as &quot;definable&quot; or &quot;nameable&quot;. Terms of this kind give rise to [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell/Whitehead, Principia Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity==
[[File:Necker cube and impossible cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]] and [[impossible cube]], an underdetermined and overdetermined object, respectively.|thumb]]
In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an ''underdetermined system'' (of equations or logic) – for example, &lt;math&gt;X=Y&lt;/math&gt; leaves open what the value of ''X'' is – while its opposite is a [[self-contradiction]], also called [[inconsistency]], [[paradoxicalness]], or [[oxymoron]], in an [[overdetermined system]] – such as &lt;math&gt;X=2, X=3&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution – see also [[underdetermination]].

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and [[impossible object]]s, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogic use of ambiguous expressions==
Ambiguity can be used as a pedagogical trick, to force students to reproduce the deduction by themselves. Some textbooks&lt;ref&gt;
H. Haug, S. Koch. Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors, http://www.allbookstores.com/book/9812387560
&lt;/ref&gt;
give the same name to the function and to its [[Fourier transform]]:
:&lt;math&gt;~f(\omega)=\int f(t) \exp(i\omega t) {\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;.
Rigorously speaking, such an expression requires that &lt;math&gt;~ f=0 ~&lt;/math&gt;;
even if function &lt;math&gt;~ f ~&lt;/math&gt; is a [[self-Fourier function]], the expression should be written as
&lt;math&gt;~f(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int f(t) \exp(i\omega t) {\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;; however, '''it is assumed that
the shape of the function ''' (and even its norm
&lt;math&gt;\int |f(x)|^2 {\rm d}x &lt;/math&gt;) '''depend on the character used to denote its argument'''.
If the Greek letter is used, it is assumed to be a Fourier transform of another function,
The first function is assumed, if the expression in the argument contains more characters &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~\tau~&lt;/math&gt;, than characters &lt;math&gt;~\omega~&lt;/math&gt;, and the second function is assumed in the opposite case. Expressions like &lt;math&gt;~f(\omega t)~&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~f(y)~&lt;/math&gt; contain symbols &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~\omega~&lt;/math&gt; in equal amounts; they are ambiguous and should be avoided in serious deduction.

The '''aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ορυκτερόπους (''orykterópous'') meaning &quot;digging footed&quot; and [[wikt:Afer|afer]]: from Africa) is a medium-sized, burrowing, [[nocturnal]] mammal native to [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; It is the only living species of the order [[Tubulidentata]],&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Tubulidentata | id = 11300004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.

It is sometimes colloquially called &quot;antbear&quot;, &quot;anteater&quot;, or the &quot;Cape anteater&quot; after the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The name comes from the [[Afrikaans]]/[[Dutch language|Dutch]]&lt;ref&gt;Obsolete Afrikaans, actually. The modern Afrikaans name is ''erdvark''. &lt;u&gt;aardvark&lt;/u&gt; (2010). In ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''. Retrieved February 2, 2010, from [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aardvark Merriam-webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; for &quot;earth pig&quot; or &quot;ground pig&quot; (''aarde'' earth/ground, ''varken'' pig), because of its burrowing habits (similar origin to the name [[groundhog]]). The aardvark is not related to the pig; rather, it is the sole recent representative of the obscure mammalian [[order (biology)|order]] [[Tubulidentata]], in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus ''[[Orycteropus]]'', the sole surviving genus in the family [[Orycteropodidae]]. The aardvark is not closely related to the [[South America]]n [[anteater]], despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, along with the [[sirenian]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[tenrecidae|tenrec]]s, and [[elephant]]s. With their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder [[Afrotheria]].

==Description==
[[File:Aardvark skeleton mount.JPG|thumb|left|An aardvark skeleton and mounted specimen at the Natural History Museum of Genoa]]
The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with an arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb')—resulting in four toes—but the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a [[claw]] and a hoof. The ears are disproportionately long, and the tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers. The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on [[termite]]s. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue and elaborate structures supporting a keen [[olfaction|sense of smell]].

An aardvark's weight is typically between 40 and 65&amp;nbsp;kg. An aardvark's length is usually between 1 and 1.3&amp;nbsp;m, and can reach lengths of 2.2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|ref=harv|wstitle=Aard-vark}}&lt;/ref&gt; when its tail (which can be up to 70 centimetres)&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; is taken into account. The aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by [[soil]]. The aardvark's coat is thin and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated [[ant]] nest, which also serves as protection from its [[predator]]s.

One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their [[teeth]]. Instead of having a [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]], each tooth has a cluster of thin, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of [[dentine]]), with individual pulp canals, held together by [[cementum]]. The teeth have no [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and [[canine tooth|canines]] at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks only have cheek teeth at the back of the [[jaw]], and have a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.2-3.3|lower=0.0.2.3}}

[[Gene]]tically speaking, the aardvark is a [[living fossil]], as its [[chromosome]]s are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early [[eutherian]] arrangement before the divergence of the major modern [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Great Uncle Aardvark?  | publisher = BBC News | date = 2003-01-20  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2676377.stm  | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Orycteropus afer.jpg|thumb|upright|Resting aardvark in [[Himeji]] City Zoo]]
The aardvark is [[nocturnal]] and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s ([[formicivore]]);&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= van Aarde, Rudi J.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 466–467|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only [[fruit]] eaten by aardvarks is the [[aardvark cucumber]]. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of [[insects]] with its long, sticky tongue&amp;mdash;as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. It can dig 2 feet in 15 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z5OoBqqYsk&amp;t=0m46s|title=Aardvarks at the Bronx Zoo| accessdate=January 31, 2011|format=flash video}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise moves fairly slowly. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly, avoiding the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. Its keen hearing warns it of predators: [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[pythonidae|pythons]].

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also [[fossorial|excavates]] burrows in which to live; temporary sites are scattered around the home range as refuges, and a main [[burrow]] is used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 metres.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and from time to time moves on and makes a new one; the old burrows are then inhabited by smaller animals like the [[African Wild Dog|African wild dog]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Only mothers and young share burrows. If attacked in the tunnel, it will seal the tunnel off behind itself or turn around and attack with its claws.

[[File:Aardvarks.jpg|thumb|left|Aardvark mother and young]]
Aardvarks only pair during the breeding season; after a [[gestation]] period of seven months, one cub weighing around 2&amp;nbsp;kg is born, and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks, and is eating termites at 14 weeks and is weaned by 16 weeks.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; At six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next [[mating season]], and is sexually capable by the season after that.

Aardvarks live for up to 24 years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

The aardvark's main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and pythons. Some African tribes also hunt aardvarks for meat. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs to lash with all fours. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.

==Habitat==
Aardvarks live in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where there is suitable [[habitat]] for them to live, such as [[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[bushland]], and available food (i.e., ants and termites).&lt;ref name=awf&gt;{{cite web | title = Aardvark  | publisher = African Wildlife Foundation | url=http://www.awf.org/content/wildlife/detail/aardvark  | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology and popular culture==
In African folklore, the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | first = Rebecca  | title = Cute as a Button but a Pain in my Butt: The Aardvark  | url=http://www.themagicalbuffet.com/Issues/Vol02_Iss07/Article_049.html  | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian god [[Set (mythology)|Set]] is said, by some, to have the head of an aardvark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianmyths.net/seth.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; or part aardvark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/set.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main [[antagonist]] ([[Cyril Sneer]])&lt;ref name=&quot;tvtropes.com The Raccoons&quot;&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRaccoons tvtropes.com The Raccoons]&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[protagonist]]s ([[Cedric Sneer]])&lt;ref name=&quot;tvtropes.com The Raccoons&quot;/&gt; of the 1980s [[Gemini Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131183/awards imdb listing ''The Raccoons'' awards]&lt;/ref&gt; winning animated television series ''[[The Raccoons]]'' were aardvarks.

The main character of ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', an animated television series for children produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/news_article.aspx?storyid=107290&amp;catid=3 WKYC.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main characters of the 1969-1971 animated cartoon ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'' is a blue aardvark voiced by [[John Byner]], doing an impersonation of [[Jackie Mason]]. It depicts the Aardvark attempting, and failing, to catch and eat his antagonist, the Ant, also voiced by Byner impersonating Dean Martin.

The '''aardwolf''' (''Proteles cristata'') is a small, [[Entomophagy|insectivorous]] [[hyena]], native to [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Southern Africa]]. The name means &quot;earth wolf&quot; in [[Afrikaans]]/[[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enc_bri&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Aardwolf (Proteles cristatus)|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]|publisher= Encyclopaedia Britannica Online|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called &quot;maanhaar jackal&quot;.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00298717 ''maanhaar''] in the ''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other hyenas, the diet of the aardwolf almost completely consists of [[termite]]s, other insect larvae and carrion.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Wildlife Fact File| publisher = [[IMP Publishing Ltd]]| year =1994| pages = Group 1, Card 144| isbn = 08-50-04-0016| nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aardwolf is the only surviving species of the subfamily '''Protelinae'''. Two subspecies are recognized: ''Proteles cristatus cristatus'' of [[Southern Africa]], and ''Proteles cristatus septentrionalis'' of [[East Africa|eastern]] and northeastern Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003205 &quot;aardwolf.&quot;] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 8 Jan. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jkim2/MolEvo/Spring2006/hyaenidae.pdf Molecular systematics of the Hyaenidae]&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually placed in the Hyaenidae, though formerly separated into the family '''Protelidae'''. The aardwolf lives in the [[scrubland]]s of eastern and southern Africa. These are the areas of land covered with stunted trees or [[shrub]]s. The aardwolf hides in a [[burrow]] during the day and comes out at night to search for food. It is related to hyenas, but unlike its relatives, it does not hunt large prey. This unusual animal is a mass killer of insects. It feeds mainly on [[termite]]s and can eat more than 200,000 in a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to collect them.

==Physical characteristics==
The aardwolf looks like a very small [[Striped Hyena]]. They have a more slender [[snout|muzzle]], sharper [[ear]]s utilized in the hunt for harvester termites, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct [[mane]] down the middle line of the neck and back, which is raised during a confrontation to make the aardwolf's size appear bigger. It is 55&amp;ndash;80&amp;nbsp;cm (22&amp;ndash;31&amp;nbsp;in) long, excluding its bushy 20&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;cm (8&amp;ndash;12&amp;nbsp;in) tail, stands about 40&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;cm (16&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;in) at the shoulder, and weighs between 9 and 14&amp;nbsp;kg (20&amp;ndash;31&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot;/&gt; Its front feet have 5 toes, unlike other hyenas which have four toes.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Its teeth and skull are similar to that of the hyena, although the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects, and its tongue for licking them up.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; As the aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on their feeding habits due to the soft nature of the insects they consume.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt; It has two glands at the rear that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and communicating with other aardwolves.
[[Image:Aardwolf Skull.JPG|thumb|left|Aardwolf [[Skull]] From the Collections of [[Skulls Unlimited International]].]]

==Distribution and habitat==
The aardwolf lives on open, dry plains and [[bushland]],  avoiding mountainous areas. Due to its specific food requirements, the animal is only found in regions where termites of the family [[Hodotermitidae]] occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed [[grassland]]s and [[savannah]]s, including [[arable land|farmland]]. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt;

There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary [[miombo]] forests.

==Behavior==
[[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|Aardwolf from the zoo in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]]]
Aardwolves are shy and [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], sleeping in underground burrows by day.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; They usually use existing burrows of [[aardvark]]s, [[Old World porcupine]]s or [[springhare]]s, despite being capable of creating their own. By night, an aardwolf can consume up to 200,000 harvester [[termites]] using its sticky, long tongue.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt; They take special care not to destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, which ensures that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They will often memorise and return to nests to save the trouble of finding a new one. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, and eggs, and occasionally small [[mammals]] and [[birds]]. Unlike other [[hyena]]s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.

The adult aardwolf is primarily solitary while foraging for food, necessary because of the scarcity and homogeneous distribution of their insect prey. They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as monogamous pairs, with their young, defending the same territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koehler |first=C. |last2=Richardson |first2=P. |year=1990 |title=Proteles cristatus |journal=[[Mammalian Species]] |volume=363 |issue= |pages=1–6 |jstor=3504197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young aardwolves generally achieve [[sexual maturity]] after two years, and the [[breeding season]] varies depending on their location, but normally takes place during the autumn or spring. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves will search their own territory as well as others' for a female to mate with. Dominant males will also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves. This can often result in conflict between two male aardwolves when one has wandered into another's territory. [[Gestation]] lasts between 90 and 110 days, producing one to five [[cubs]] (most often two or three) during the rainy season, when termites are active.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; The first six to eight weeks are spent in the [[den]] with the mother. After three months, they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent. However, they will often use the same den as their mother until the next breeding season. They can achieve a [[life expectancy|lifespan]] of up to 15 years when in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].

==Interaction with humans==
[[Agriculture]] may create a negative impact on their population due to use of poisons by farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUCN&quot;/&gt; They are often considered useful, non-dangerous animals by farmers. However, in some areas the aardwolf is hunted for its fur. Encounters with [[dog]]s are another threat.

Adobe buildings are similar to [[cob (building)|cob]] and [[mudbrick]] buildings. Adobe structures are extremely durable and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. In hot [[climate]]s, compared with wooden buildings, adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater [[thermal mass]], but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Collyns |first=Dan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Peru rebuilds two years on from quake |work= |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-15 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8201971.stm |doi= |accessdate=2009-08-24 }} Cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake]] and the [[2003 Bam earthquake]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common in the [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[West Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, Trevor. ''The Masons of Djenne''.

Adobe had been in use by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in the [[Southwestern United States]], [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Andes|Andean region]] of South America for several thousand years, although often substantial amounts of stone are used in the walls of [[Pueblo]] buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = | coauthors = Linda Black, Larry S.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller ''adobes'', which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger ''adobines'', some of which may be one to two yards (2 m) long.

==Etymology==
[[File:San Pedro de Atacama church.jpg|thumb|left|Church at [[San Pedro de Atacama]], [[Chile]].]]

The word ''adobe'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|iː}} has existed for around 4000 years with little change in either pronunciation or meaning: the word can be traced from the [[Middle Egyptian]] (c. 2000 BC) word ''dj-b-t'' &quot;mud [''i.e.'', sun-dried] brick.&quot; As Middle Egyptian evolved into [[Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], and finally [[Coptic language|Coptic]] (c. 600 BC), ''dj-b-t'' became ''tobe'' &quot;[mud] brick.&quot;  This evolved into [[Arabic]] ''al-tub'' (الطّوب ''al'' &quot;the&quot; + ''tub'' &quot;brick&quot;) &quot;[mud] brick,&quot; which was assimilated into [[Old Spanish]] as ''adobe'' {{IPA|[aˈdobe]}}, still with the meaning &quot;mud brick.&quot;  English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century.

[[File:Santa Fe adobe.jpg|thumb|right|Adobe style in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
In more modern English usage, the term &quot;adobe&quot; has come to include a style of architecture that is popular in the [[desert]] [[climate]]s of [[North America]], especially in [[New Mexico]].  (Compare with [[stucco]]).

==Composition==
An adobe brick is a [[composite material]] made of clay mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung. The soil composition typically contains [[clay]] and [[sand]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. [[feces|Dung]] offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  The mixture is roughly half sand (50%), one-third clay (35%), and one-sixth straw (15%).{{Clarify|reason=units|date=June 2010}}

==Adobe bricks==
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]
Bricks are made in an open frame, {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|36|cm|0|abbr=on}} being a reasonable size, but any convenient size is acceptable. The mixture is molded by the frame, and then the frame is removed quickly. After drying a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying.  Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.

The same mixture to make bricks, without the straw, is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The brick’s thickness is preferred partially due to its thermal capabilities, and partially due to the stability of a thicker brick versus a more standard size brick.  Depending on the form that the mixture is pressed into, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying time is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks.  Reinforcement can include manure, straw, [[cement]], [[rebar]] or wooden posts.  Experience has shown that straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Technical Information Online |url=http://practicalaction.org/docs/technical_information_service/mud_plasters_and_renders.pdf |title=Mud Plasters and Renders - Technical Information Online - Practical Answers |publisher=Practicalaction.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general testing is done on the soil content first.  To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid.  After the jar is sealed the container is shaken vigorously for at least one minute.  It is then allowed to sit on a flat surface for a day or so until the soil has settled into layers or remains in suspension. Heavier particles settle out first so gravel will be on the bottom, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The New Mexico US Extension Service recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.
The largest structure ever made from adobe (bricks) was the [[Bam Citadel]], which suffered serious damage (up to 80%) by an earthquake on December 26, 2003. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in [[Peru]], with 100 million signed bricks, the ciudellas of [[Chan Chan]] and [[Tambo Colorado]], both in Peru.

==Thermal properties==
An adobe wall can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction.  In tropical and other climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe levels out the heat transfer through the wall to the living space.  The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ([[radiation]]) and from the surrounding air ([[convection]]) before they warm through to the interior and begin to transfer heat to the living space.  After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time lag effect.  Thus a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.  In addition, the exterior of an adobe wall can be covered with glass to increase heat collection.  In a [[passive solar heating|passive solar]] home, this is called a [[Trombe wall]].

==Adobe wall construction==
&lt;center&gt;{{wide image|Ancient Bam, 2002.png|1000px|&lt;center&gt;The [[citadel]] of [[Bam, Iran|Bam]], or [[Arg-é Bam]], in [[Kerman]] province of [[Iran]]: The world's largest adobe structure, dating to at least 500 BC.&lt;/center&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

When building an adobe structure, the ground should be compressed because the weight of adobe bricks is significantly greater than a frame house and may cause cracking in the wall.  The footing is dug and compressed once again.  Footing depth depends on the region and its ground frost level.  The footing and stem wall are commonly 24&quot; and 14&quot;, much larger than a frame house because  of the weight of the walls.  Adobe bricks are laid by course.  Each [[Course (architecture)|course]] is laid the whole length of the wall, overlapping at the corners on a layer of adobe mortar.  Adobe walls usually never rise above 2 stories because they're load bearing and have low structural strength.  When placing window and door openings, a [[lintel]] is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above.  Within the last courses of brick, bond beams are laid across the top of the bricks to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof to distribute the weight more evenly along the wall.  To protect the interior and exterior adobe wall, finishes can be applied, such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco.  These finishes protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically, or the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters providing longer protection.

==Adobe roof==
The traditional adobe roof has been generally constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand, and other available organic materials.  The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe. For a deeper understanding of adobe, one might examine a cob building.  [[Cob (building)|Cob]], a close cousin to adobe, contains proportioned amounts of soil, clay, water, manure, and straw.  This is blended, but not formed like adobe.  Cob is spread and piled around a frame and allowed to air dry for several months before habitation.  Adobe, then, can be described as dried bricks of cob, stacked and mortared together with more adobe mixture to create a thick wall and/or roof.

===Roof materials===
Depending on the materials available, a roof can be assembled using lengths of wood or metal to create a frame work to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the frame work has been performed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly.  This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent major cracking.

===Traditional adobe roof===
More traditional adobe roofs were often flatter than the familiar steeped roof as the native climate yielded more sun and heat than mass amounts of snow or rain that would find use in precipitous roofs.  Cement may be introduced to prevent moisture from penetrating the composite of mud and organic matter. [[Viga (architecture)|Vigas]] are beams across the roof that support the roof.

===Raising a traditional adobe roof===
To raise a flattened adobe roof, beams of wood or metal should be assembled and span the extent of the building.  The ends of the beams should then be fixed to the tops of the walls using the builder’s preferred choice of attachments.  Taking into account the material the beams and walls are made from, choosing the attachments may prove difficult.  In combination to the bricks and adobe mortar that are laid across the beams creates an even load-bearing pressure that can last for many years depending on attrition.

Once the beams are laid across the building, it is then time to begin the placing of adobe bricks to create the roof.  An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a larger expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the beams.  This wider shape also provides the future homeowner with thermal protection enough to stabilize an even temperature through out the year.  Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least an inch thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick’s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during the seasons where the arid climate does produce rain. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Attributes===
Depending on the materials, Adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof, which is a valuable attribute when the fireplace is kept lit during the cold nights.  The construction of the chimney can also greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the right materials.  The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls.

[[File:Walking Across Log.JPG|thumb|Activities such as [[hiking]] and [[exploring]] can be seen as adventurous.]]

An '''adventure''' is defined as an exciting or unusual experience; it may also be a bold, usually [[risk|risky]] undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure Dictionary.com Unabridged]. Retrieved 4 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to refer to activities with some potential for physical danger, such as [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]] and or participating in [[extreme sports]]. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, a love affair, or other major life undertakings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/travel/23borneo.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/a-new-entrant-in-adventure-travel-outfitters/ New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/services/newspaper/mediacenter/releases/la-mediacenter-2009-0224,0,6901938.story Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/travel/destinations/outdoorsadventure/ Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventurous experiences create psychological and physiological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]), and which can be detrimental as stated by the [[Yerkes-Dodson law]].  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), &quot;If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?&quot;. Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&quot;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[excitement]]: examples are  [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

==Adventure in mythology==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the &quot;call to adventure&quot;, followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph. The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these &quot;protagonist on adventurous journey&quot; characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adventurers==
An adventurer is a person who bases his lifestyle or their fortunes on adventurous acts. An adventurer or adventuress is a term that usually takes one of three meanings:

*One whose travels are unusual and often exotic, though not so unique as to qualify as [[exploration]].
*One who lives by their wits.
*One who takes part in a risky or speculative course of action for profit or position.

In fiction, the adventurer figure or [[Picaro]] may be regarded as a descendant of the [[knight-errant]] of [[Medieval]] [[romance (genre)|romance]]. Like the knight, the adventurer roams through episodic encounters, usually involving wealth, romance, or fighting. Unlike the knight, the adventurer was a realistic figure, often lower class or otherwise impoverished, who is forced to make his way to fortune, often by deceit. Also, an adventurer is a roguish hero of low social class who lives by his or her wits in a corrupt society.  The [[picaresque]] novel originated in [[Spain]] in the middle of the fifteenth century. Novels such as [[Lazarillo de Tormes]] were influential across Europe. Throughout the eighteenth century, a great number of  novels featured bold, amoral, adventuring protagonists, who made their way into wealth and happiness, sometimes with and sometimes without the moral conversion that generally accompanies the Spanish model.

Under [[Victorian morality]] the term, used without qualifiers, came to imply a person of low [[moral character]], often someone trying to marry for money.

In comic books such as ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' and ''[[Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe]]'', the term &quot;adventurer&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;[[super-hero]]&quot; when listing a character's occupation.

In [[role-playing games]], the [[player characters]] are often professional adventurers, who earn wealth and fame by adventure, such as undertaking hazardous missions, exploring ruins, and slaying monsters. This stereotype is strong enough that ''the adventurers'' can often be used as a synonym for ''the player characters''. [[Non-player character]] groups of adventurers can also exist, and can be an interesting encounter for the players.

'''Asia''' is the world's largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It covers 8.6% of the [[Earth]]'s total surface area (or 29.9% of its land area) and with approximately 4 billion people, it hosts 60% of the world's current [[human population]]. During the 20th century Asia's population nearly quadrupled.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=346605 Like herrings in a barrel]&quot;. ''The Economist.'' December 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia is traditionally defined as part of the [[landmass]] of [[Eurasia]]—with the western portion of the latter occupied by [[Europe]]—located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]], [[east]] of the [[Ural Mountains]] and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma-Manych Depression]])&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia Asia]&quot;. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 2006. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatlGeoAtlas&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} &quot;Europe&quot; (pp. 68–9); &quot;Asia&quot; (pp. 90–1): &quot;A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Given its size and diversity, Asia—a [[toponymy|toponym]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—is more a [[human geography|cultural concept]] incorporating a number of [[region]]s and peoples than a [[physical geography|homogeneous physical entity]]&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;&quot;[http://www.answers.com/topic/asia-2010#Science_and_Technology_Encyclopedia Asia]&quot;. ''[[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]].'' 2006. New York: McGraw-Hill Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Subregions of Asia]]'', ''[[Asian people]]''). The wealth of Asia differs very widely among and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]], due to its vast size and huge range of different ethnic groups, cultures, environments, historical ties and government systems.

Asia has been the historical birthplace of all major [[world religion]]s.

[[File:two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Two-point equidistant projection]] of Asia and surrounding landmasses.]]
The original distinction between Europe and Asia was made by the [[ancient Greek]]s. They used the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], and the [[Sea of Azov]] as the border between Asia and Europe. The [[Nile]] was used as the border between Asia and [[Africa]] (then called Libya), although some Greek geographers suggested the [[Red Sea]] would form a better boundary. However the Nile was usually considered the border until the 15th century, when the boundary was changed to the [[Persian Gulf]], the Red Sea, and the [[Isthmus of Suez]]. At the same time, the border of between Asia and Europe became an issue, as the old boundaries did not extend to the arctic as previously thought. In the eighteenth century the [[Ural mountain]]s were first suggested as the border, and by the nineteenth century this border had become the accepted divide. To connect this to the previous divide, the border was extended southwards from the mountains to the [[Ural river]], after which it passed through the [[Caspian Sea]] and crossed the crest of the [[Caucasus]], forming the widely accepted boundary used today. The border between Asia and [[Oceania]] is placed somewhere in the [[Malay archipelago]], with islands belonging to Indonesia usually included in Asia, including the [[West Papua (region)|western half]] of [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The myth of continents: a critique of metageography |first=Martin W. |last= Lewis |first2= Kären |last2= Wigen |publisher=University of California Press |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-520-20743-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contentions about the borders still exist. Asia is the largest and most culturally diverse of the continents in the seven-continent system,&lt;!--Page 37 of The Myth of continents--&gt; and does not exactly match with conventional Asian cultural boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;/&gt; Some definitions exclude [[Turkey]], the Middle East, [[Central Asia]] and Russia while only considering the Far East, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent to compose Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Welty, Paul Thomas.

Some geographers do not consider Asia and Europe to be separate continents,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574726/Asia.html Asia].&quot; ''[[Encarta|MSN Encarta Encyclopedia]]''. 2007.

Almost all of Europe and most of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Cherskiy Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Asia&quot; is originally a concept exclusively of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; The peoples of ancient ''Asia'' (Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Persians, Arabs etc.) never conceived the idea of ''Asia'', simply because they did not see themselves collectively. In their perspective, they were vastly varied civilizations, contrary to ancient European belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt;

The word ''Asia'' originated from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Ἀσία'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa Ἀσία],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; first attributed to [[Herodotus]] (about 440&amp;nbsp;BC) in reference to [[Anatolia]] or—in describing the Persian Wars—to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names are used to describe one enormous and substantial land mass ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asias, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe in [[Sardis]]. Even before Herodotus, [[Homer]] knew of two figures in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]]; and elsewhere he describes a marsh as ασιος (Iliad 2, 461). In [[Greek mythology]], &quot;Asia&quot; (''Ἀσία'') or &quot;Asie&quot; (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a [[Nymph]] or [[Titans|Titan]] goddess of [[Lydia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html Asie], on ''Theoi Project'', Exploring Greek Mythology and the Gods in Classical Literature and Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term soon became common in ancient Greece, and subsequently by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Ancient and medieval European maps depict the Asian continent as a &quot;huge amorphous blob&quot; extending eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; It was presumed in antiquity to end with [[India]]—the [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] king [[Alexander the Great]] believing he would reach the &quot;end of the world&quot; upon his arrival in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt;

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''{{Unicode|(w)aṣû(m)}}'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the [[sun]] at sunrise in the [[Middle East]] and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

T.R. Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;&gt;Reid, T.R. ''Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west'' Vintage Books(1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt;

However, this etymology is considered doubtful, because it does not explain how the term &quot;Asia&quot; first came to be associated with Anatolia, which is ''west'' of the Semitic-speaking areas, unless they refer to the viewpoint of a [[Phoenicia]]n sailor sailing through the straits between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the Black Sea.

Also, ''Assuwa'' has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent &quot;Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bossert, Helmut T.,  ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western [[Anatolia]], defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around [[1400 BC]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Asia}}
[[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Asia in 1890.]]
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], linked by the interior mass of the [[Central Asia]]n [[steppes]].

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Huanghe River|Huanghe]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]] took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe.

As of 2010, the largest economies in Asia are [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[South Korea]] and [[Indonesia]].

Japan has had for only several decades after WW2 the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the [[Soviet Union]] (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or [[APEC]]).

According to IMF statistics for the year 2010, the mostly unrecognised [[Republic of China]] PPP-adjusted GDP per capita, at USD 34,743, is already higher than that of Finland, France, or Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} By 2027, according to [[Goldman Sachs]], China will have the largest economy in the world. Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

Asia is the largest continent in the [[world]] by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as [[petroleum]], [[forest]]s, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in mainland [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Philippines]] and [[Singapore]]. [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporations]], but increasingly mainland [[China]], and [[India]] are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure. 

According to [[Citigroup]] 9 of 11 [[3G (countries)|Global Growth Generators]] countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are [[Bangladesh]], China, India, Indonesia, [[Iraq]], Mongolia, Philippines, [[Sri Lanka]] and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sme.com.ph/sme-news/news.php?newsid=2324 |title=Philippine potential cited |publisher=sme.com.ph |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia has four main financial centres: [[Tokyo]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Shanghai]]. [[Call centre]]s and [[business process outsourcing]] (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, [[English language|English-speaking]] workers. The increased use of [[outsourcing]] has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centres. Due to its large and extremely competitive [[information technology]] industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

==Demographics==
[[East Asia]] had by far the strongest overall [[HDI]] performance of any region in the [[world]], nearly doubling average [[HDI]] attainment over the past 40 years, according to the Report’s analysis of [[health]], [[education]] and income data. [[PR China]], the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the “Top 10 Movers” list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region’s top performers in improving school enrolment and life expectancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Nepal]], a [[South Asia|South Asian country]], emerges as one of the world’s fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present [[life expectancy]] is 25 years longer than 1970's.; more than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br&gt; [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the “very high human development” category), followed by [[Hong Kong]], China (SAR)(21) and [[Singapore]] (27). [[Afghanistan]] (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.
=== Mythology ===
{{See also|List of Asian mythology}}
Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Christians in the Old Testament, is first found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] tells about an [[Avatar]] of the [[Vishnu|God Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] of a terrible flood. In ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Shan Hai Jing]], the Chinese ruler [[King Yu of Xia of China|Da Yu]], had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess [[Nüwa]] who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.

=== Religions ===
{{See also|Eastern philosophy|Religion in Asia}}
Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of material world. [[Christianity]] is also present in most Asian countries.
[[File:Phutthamonthon Buddha.JPG|thumb|right|[[Buddhist]] monks in Thailand.]]

==== Abrahamic ====
The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Baha'i Faith]] originated in [[West Asia]]. Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel (which has the world's largest [[Jewish]] population),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=The Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; though small communities exist in other countries, such as the [[Bene Israel]] in India. In the Philippines and [[East Timor]], [[Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the [[Spain|Spaniards]] and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], respectively. In [[Armenia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is the predominant religion. Various [[Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]] have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India. The world's largest Muslim community (within the bounds of one nation) is in [[Indonesia]]. [[South Asia]] (mainly [[Pakistan]], India and [[Bangladesh]]) holds 30% of Muslims. There are also significant Muslim populations in China, [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], southern [[Philippines]] ([[Mindanao]]), Russia and most of West Asia and [[Central Asia]]. The Bahá'í Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th Century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because the Bahá'í Faith's activities in many Muslim countries has been severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|suppressed]] by authorities.

==== Dharmic and Taoist ====
The [[religions]] of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of [[Cambodia]] (98%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nobel prizes ===
[[File:Tagore3.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabindranath Tagore|[[Rabindranath Tagore]], of India, the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]].]]

The [[polymath]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]], a [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] Indian poet, [[drama]]tist, and writer from [[Santiniketan]], now in [[West Bengal]], India, became in 1913 the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]]. He won his [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on [[English literature|English]], [[French literature|French]], and other national literatures of Europe and the [[Americas]]. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.

Tagore is said to have named another Bengali Indian Nobel prize winner, the 1998 laureate in Economics, [[Amartya Sen]]. Sen's work has centered on global issues including famine, welfare, and third-world development. Amartya Sen was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge University, UK, from 1998 to 2004, becoming the first Asian to head an 'Oxbridge' College.

Other Asian writers who won Nobel Prizes include [[Yasunari Kawabata]] (Japan, 1966), [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] (Japan, 1994), [[Gao Xingjian]] (People's Republic of China, 2000) and [[Orhan Pamuk]] (Turkey, 2006).

Also, [[Mother Teresa]] of India and [[Shirin Ebadi]] of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from [[Burma]] for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma(Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a [[Buddhist]] and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Most recently, Chinese dissident [[Liu Xiaobo]] was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.&quot; He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.

Sir [[C. V. Raman|C.V.Raman]] is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] &quot;for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the [[Raman scattering|effect named after him]]&quot;.

Other Asian Nobel Prize winners include [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], [[Abdus Salam]], [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], [[Robert Aumann]], [[Menachem Begin]], [[Aaron Ciechanover]], [[Avram Hershko]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ada Yonath]], [[Yaser Arafat]], [[Jose Ramos Horta]] and Bishop [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]] of [[Timor Leste]], [[Kim Dae-jung]], and 13 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] scientists. Most of the said awardees are from [[Japan]] and [[Israel]] except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Salam (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories) Kim (South Korea), Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).

In 2006, Dr. [[Muhammad Yunus]] of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of [[Grameen Bank]], a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitutes with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.

The Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=His Holiness's Teachings at TCV |url=http://www.dalailama.com/biography/a-brief-biography |title=A Brief Biography - The Office of His Holiness The Dalai Lama |publisher=Dalailama.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada. On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom. Most notable was the Nobel Peace Prize, presented in [[Oslo, Norway]] on 10 December 1989.

'''Aruba''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|r|uː|b|ə}} {{respell|ə|ROO|bə}}) is a 33&amp;nbsp;km-long island of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]], located 27&amp;nbsp;km north of the coast of [[Venezuela]]. Together with [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], it forms a group referred to as the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the [[Leeward Antilles]], the southern island chain of the [[Lesser Antilles]].

Aruba, which has no administrative subdivisions, is one of the four [[constituent country|constituent countries]] that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], together with the [[Netherlands]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Sint Maarten]] whose citizens share a single nationality: Dutch citizen. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, [[cactus]]-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of {{convert|180|km2|sqmi}} and is densely populated with its estimated 103,000 people. It lies outside the [[hurricane belt]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Aruba}}

Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been [[Caquetios Indian|Caquetíos Amerinds]] from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] tribe, who migrated there from [[Venezuela]] to escape attacks by the [[Caribs]]. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. Sea currents made [[canoe]] travel to other [[Caribbean islands]] difficult, thus [[Caquetio]] culture remained closer to that of mainland [[South America]].

[[File:Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The capital [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]]]

Europeans first learned of Aruba when [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] happened upon it in August 1499.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vespucci, in one of his four letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], described his voyage to the islands along the coast of [[Venezuela]].  He wrote about an island where most trees are of [[brazil wood]] and, from this island, he went to one ten [[league (unit)|leagues]] away, where they had houses built as in [[Venice]]. In another letter he described a small island inhabited by very large people, which the expedition thought was not inhabited. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Aruba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] for over a century. The Cacique or Indian Chief in Aruba, Simas, welcomed the first priests in Aruba and received from them a wooden cross as a gift.  In 1508, Alonso de Ojeda was appointed as Spain's first Governor of Aruba, as part of &quot;Nueva Andalucía.&quot;

Another governor appointed by Spain was Juan Martinez de Ampíes. A &quot;cédula real&quot; decreed in November 1525 gave Ampíes, factor of Española, the right to repopulate the depopulated islands of Aruba, [[Curaçao]] and [[Bonaire]].

In 1528, Ampíes was replaced by a representative of the &quot;[[Welser|House of Welser]]&quot;.  Aruba has been under [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] administration since 1636, initially under [[Peter Stuyvesant]]. Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. Under the Dutch W.I.C. administration, as &quot;New Netherland and Curaçao&quot; from 1648 to 1664 and the Dutch government regulations of 1629, also applied in Aruba. The Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as &quot;Commandeur&quot; in Aruba in 1667.

In August 1806, General [[Francisco de Miranda]] and a group of 200 freedom fighters on their voyage to liberate Venezuela from Spain stayed in Aruba for several weeks.

In 1933 Aruba sent its first petition for Aruba's separate status and autonomy to the Queen.

During [[World War II]], together with Curaçao, the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.  On February 16, 1942, its oil processing refinery was attacked by a German submarine ([[German submarine U-156 (1941)|''U-156'']]) under the command of Werner Hartenstein, but the mission failed. ''U-156'' was later (8 March 1943) [http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm destroyed by a US plane] as the crew was sunbathing. In March 1944, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba. In attendance were: His Excellency, Dr. P. Kasteel, the Governor of Curaçao, and his aide, Lieutenant Ivan Lansberg; Rear Admiral T. E. Chandler and his Aide, Lieutenant W. L. Edgington; Captain Jhr. W. Boreel and his aide, Lieutenant E. O. Holmberg; and the Netherlands aide to Mrs. Roosevelt, Lieutenant Commander v.d. Schatte Olivier.

The island's economy has been dominated by five main industries: [[gold mining]], [[phosphate]] mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), [[aloe]] export, [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]] (The Lago Oil &amp; Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.), and [[tourism]].

[[File:Parlamento di Aruba (front).jpg|thumb|Parliament of Aruba in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].]]
As a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member [[parliamentary democracy|Parliament]] and an eight-member Cabinet. The [[governor of Aruba]] is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or &quot;Parlamento&quot;) for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.

Together with the [[Netherlands]], the countries of Aruba, [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission of people from the [[Netherlands]]. There is the supervision of the admission and expulsion of people from the [[Netherlands]] and the setting of general conditions for the admission and expulsion of aliens. Aruba is officially not a part of the [[European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Although the equality of the countries in the Kingdom is explicitly laid down in the preamble to the Charter, which states &quot;..considering that they have expressed freely their will to establish a new constitutional order in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in which they will conduct their internal interests autonomously and their common interests on a basis of equality, and in which they will accord each other reciprocal assistance, have resolved by mutual consent&quot;, in practice, the Netherlands has considerably more power than the other constituent countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Moves towards independence===
In August 1947, Aruba presented its first &quot;Staatsreglement&quot; ([[constitution]]), for Aruba's &quot;status aparte&quot; as the status of an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In November 1955, J. Irausquin of Aruba's PPA political party spoke in front of the United Nations Trust Committee. He ended his speech saying that in the future there will be changes to come.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}

In 1972, at a conference in [[Suriname]], [[Betico Croes]] (MEP) proposed a &quot;sui-generis&quot; Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], each with its own nationality. Mr. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a [[referendum]] for the people of Aruba to determine Aruba's separate status or &quot;Status Aparte&quot; as a full autonomous state under the crown. He proclaimed: &quot;Aruba shall never accept a federation and a second class nationality.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Betico Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, a committee appointed by Croes introduced the national flag and anthem as the symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence, and he also set 1981 as a target for Aruba's independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the [[United Nations]] and 82% of the participants voted for independence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague to prepare a study of Aruba's independence, which was published in 1978, titled &quot;Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg&quot;. At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983 Aruba finally reached an official agreement within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom]] for Aruba's Independence, which would occur in a series of steps granting increasing autonomy. in August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for Aruba's first parliament,  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was set for 1996.

This achievement is largely due to Betico Croes and the political support of other nations like the USA, [[Panama]], Venezuela and various European countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Croes was later proclaimed &quot;Libertador di Aruba&quot; after his death in 1986. In 1990, movement toward independence was postponed upon the request of Aruba's Prime Minister, [[Nelson Oduber|Nelson O. Oduber]]. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process can begin again after a referendum.

==Law==
The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model.  Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with a ''Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg'' ([[Court of First Instance]]) on Aruba, a ''Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie voor de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba'' ([[Common Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba]]) and the ''[[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]]'' (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aruba.com/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx Aruba.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Korps Politie Aruba'' ([[Aruba Police Force]]) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPA-districts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|title=Korps Politie Aruba: district precincts|publisher=Aruba Police Force|accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Aruba's educational system, patterned after the [[Education in the Netherlands|Dutch system]], provides for education at all levels. The Government finances the national education system, except for private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), which finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.

Arubans benefit from a strong primary school education. A segmented secondary school program includes vocational training (VMBO), basic education (MAVO), college prep (HAVO) and advanced placement (VWO).

Higher education goals can be pursued through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.

There are 68 schools for primary education, 12 schools for secondary education, and 5 universities. In 2007, there were 22,930 fulltime students registered.

There are two private medical schools in Aruba: [[All Saints University of Medicine]], Aruba and [[Xavier University School of Medicine, Aruba]]. All courses are presented in English. School's curriculum is based on the United States medical school model and will lead to a Doctor of Medicine degree that is recognized in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;imed.ecfmg.org&quot;&gt;[http://imed.ecfmg.org/ IMED - FAIMER International Medical Education Directory - Search IMED&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the [[Leeward Antilles]] island arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Aruba is renowned for its white, sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents, and this is where most tourist development has taken place. The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans. The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at {{convert|165|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and [[Mount Jamanota]], the highest on the island at {{convert|188|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above [[sea level]]. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{Coord|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.

To the east of Aruba are [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]; this group of islands is sometimes called the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]].

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Aruba}}
The [[wikt:isothermal|isothermal]] temperature of Aruba's pleasantly [[tropical marine climate]] attracts tourists to the island all year round. Temperature varies little from {{convert|28|°C|1}}, moderated by constant [[trade wind]]s from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Yearly precipitation barely reaches {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, most of it falling in late autumn.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Aruba}}

Aruba enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region including a low unemployment rate. About three quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through [[tourism]] or related activities. Most tourists are from Venezuela and the [[United States]] (predominantly from eastern and southern states). Before the &quot;Status Aparte&quot; (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The GDP per capita for Aruba was calculated to be $23,831 in 2007; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas. Its main trading partners are [[Venezuela]], the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]].

[[Deficit spending]] has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. Recent efforts at tightening monetary policy are correcting this and Aruba will have its first balanced budget in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Aruba received some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as &quot;Aruba's Financial Independence&quot;) in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year. The Aruban florin is pegged to the [[United States dollar]], with a fixed exchange rate of 1.77 Florin to 1 U.S. dollar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In most stores near Oranjestad, the exchange rate is 1.75 florin to 1 U.S dollar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2006 the Aruban government has also changed several tax laws to further reduce the deficit. [[Direct tax]]es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007. The inflation on Aruba in 2007 was 8.7%.

==Demographics==
[[File:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|300px|left|Population of Aruba according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.]]
{{Main|Demographics of Aruba}}
Aruba is situated in the deep southern part of the Caribbean.  Because it has almost no rainfall, Aruba was saved from the plantation system and the economics of the [[slave trade]].

Aruba's population is estimated to be 80% [[mestizo]] and 20% other ethnicities. Arawaks spoke the &quot;broken Spanish&quot; which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.  The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, left the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.

Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of 3 years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela, far more so than neighboring Curaçao and Bonaire. Much of Aruba's families are present by way of Venezuela and there is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

===Jewish community===
Today the [[Jews|Jewish]] community of Aruba numbers about 35 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/blogs/blog_cdo/aid/1276786/jewish/The-Prime-Minister-Wants-Tefillin.htm Chabad.org The Prime Minister Wants Tefillin]&lt;/ref&gt; The community officially dates back to 1754, when Moses Solomon Halevi Maduro, his wife and six children received special permission to reside on the island by the Dutch royalty. Maduro founded the main [[shipping]] company, Maduro &amp; Sons. The Jewish cemetery, which began to be used regularly for burials by the Jewish community beginning in 1837, contains eight tombstones dating back to 1563, the only indication of a Jewish presence on the island before the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;prime&quot;&gt;Marks, Yehudah. ''Jewish Prime Minister of Aruba Orders Pair of Tefillin''. [[Hamodia]], World News, 2 September 2010, p. B42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current prime minister of the island nation, [[Mike Eman]], is of Jewish descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;prime&quot; /&gt;

===Cities and towns===
{{main|List of cities in Aruba}}
The island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities.

{{Main|Culture of Aruba}}
{{See also|Music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles }}
[[File:Centrum Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ornate buildings in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]], Aruba.]]
On March 18 Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.

The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of &quot;[[Sinterklaas]]&quot; on December 5 and 6 and other national holidays like April 30, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queen's birthday or &quot;Dia di La Reina&quot; ([[Koninginnedag]]) is celebrated.

Christmas and New Year are celebrated with the typical music and songs of gaitas for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and the &quot;ayaca&quot;, the &quot;ponche crema&quot; and &quot;ham&quot;, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of dollars worth of [[fireworks]] are burnt at midnight on New Year's.

On January 25, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated.

The holiday of [[Carnival]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like [[Mardi Gras]], that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

In June there is the celebration of the &quot;Dia di San Juan&quot;, with the song of &quot;Dera Gai&quot;.

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving Day in November.

Religion also has its influences; the days of Ascension and Good Friday are also two holidays on the island.

According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island.

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of Aruba}}
Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and – since 2003 – [[Papiamento]]. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A [[creole language]] spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. Like many islands in the region, Spanish is also often spoken. English has historical connections (with the [[British Empire]]) and is known by many; English usage has also grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German and French. The latter is offered in high school and college, since a high percentage of Aruban students continue their studies in Europe.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards the Portuguese roots and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot;), where others are more oriented towards the Dutch roots.

In a book ''The Buccaneers of America'', first published in 1678, it is stated by eyewitness account that the Indians on Aruba spoke &quot;Spanish&quot;. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803.

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'' and ''Awe Mainta'' and two in English : ''Aruba Today'' and ''The News''. ''Amigoe'' is the newspaper published in Dutch.
Aruba also has 18 radio stations (2 AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).

==Infrastructure==
Aruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is located near Oranjestad. This airport has daily flights to various cities across the United States, to San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Washington DC; New York City; and Boston, Massachusetts. It also connects Aruba with [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and South America, with daily flights to the international airports of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Germany, France, Spain, U.K and most of Europe through the [[Schiphol Airport]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Direct flights from Italy started in November 2008.

According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, of which 61% were Americans.

In cooperation with the United States government, and for the facilitation for the passengers that arrive into the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since February 1, 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport, United States and Aruba have the agreement since 1986 that begins as a USDA and Customs post, and since 2008, the only island to have this service for private flights. In 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] established a Forward Operating Location (FOL) at the airport.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad. The Port of Playa welcomes all the cruise-ship lines, including [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line]], [[Disney Cruise Line]] and many more; an estimated almost one million tourists enter in this port per year, Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government is the authority in these seaports.

Aruba's public buses transportation services is in charge of Arubus, a government based company which operates from 3:30am until 12:30am 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide the transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.

Aruba also counts two telecommunications providers, [[SetarNV|Setar]] the government based company and [[Digicel]] Irish ownership company based in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. [[SetarNV|Setar]] is the provider of services such as Internet, video conference, GSM wireless tech and land lines and offer the latest in telecom services, [[Digicel]] is the Setar competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform.

The '''Articles of Confederation''', formally the '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', was the first written [[constitution]] or plan of government of the [[United States of America]] and specified how the national government was to operate. It was drafted in 1776-77 and became the working constitution, although it was not formally ratified until 1781.  The Articles legitimized the Congress in its supervision of the [[American Revolution]], its diplomacy with Europe, and its handling of territorial issues. Nationalists complained that it was too weak, and after extensive debate it was replaced by the current Constitution in 1789.


==Background==
The political push for the colonies to increase cooperation began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 when [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed an intercolonial collaboration that resembled the Articles. Starting in 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] acted as the [[provisional government|provisional national government]] that ran the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though they were uncommon in other nations. Meanwhile, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military, and economic authority over the colonies. It adopted commercial codes, established and maintained an army and selected its generals, issued money, created a military code of law, defined crimes, and negotiated with foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The Creation of the American Republic: 1776-1787 (1969), pp.354-55&lt;/ref&gt;
==Drafting==
[[File:Articles of Confederation 1977 Issue-13c.jpg|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;Articles of Confederation 200th Anniversary commemorative stamp&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;First issued in York, Penn., 1977&lt;/center&gt;]]
The [[Second Continental Congress]] appointed a committee to draft the Articles in June 1776 and sent the draft to the states for ratification in November 1777.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarz&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_72.shtml Frederic D. Schwarz] &quot;225 Years Ago,&quot; ''American Heritage'', February/March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777. The ratification process was completed in March 1781. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.

On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states. The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate. In practice, the final draft of the Articles served as the [[de facto]] system of government used by the Congress (&quot;the United States in Congress assembled&quot;) until it became [[de jure]] by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. The ''Articles'' set the rules for operations of the United States government. It was capable of making war, negotiating diplomatic agreements, and resolving issues regarding the western territories. Article XIII stipulated that &quot;their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state&quot; and &quot;[[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]]&quot;.

==Operation==
The Articles were created by the representatives of the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a perceived need to have &quot;a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States.&quot; After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived. In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the [[United States Constitution]] and the new government began operations in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789'' (1988), pp. 245-66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratification==
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states. Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties...''&lt;ref name=ratificationletter&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00941)) Monday, November 17, 1777], Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lawhome.html A Century of Lawmaking, 1774-1873]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The document could not become officially effective until it was [[Ratification|ratified]] by all 13 colonies. The first state to ratify was [[Virginia]] on December 16, 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dates of ratification are given as follows in ''American Constitutions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Constitutions|last=Hough|first=Franklin Benjamin|year=1872|page=10|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E24LAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

South Carolina, February 5, 1778; New York, February 6, 1778; Rhode Island, February 9, 1778; Connecticut, February 12, 1778; Georgia, February 26, 1778; New Hampshire, March 4, 1778; Pennsylvania, March 5, 1778; Massachusetts, March 10, 1778; North Carolina, April 5, 1778; New Jersey, November 19, 1778; Virginia, December 15, 1778; Delaware, February 1, 1779; Maryland, January 30, 1781.

The process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West. [[Maryland]] was the last holdout; it refused to go along until [[Virginia]] and New York agreed to [[State cessions|cede their claims]] in the [[Ohio River]] Valley. A little over three years passed before Maryland's ratification on March 1, 1781.

The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of [[Canada]] into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.

==Article summaries==
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents are very different. The original five-page Articles contained a preamble, 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.
The preamble states that the signatory states &quot;agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union&quot; between the 13 states (the former British colonies).
The following list contains short summaries of each of the 13 articles.
# Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: &quot;The Style of this confederacy shall be &quot;The United States of America.&quot;
# Asserts the equality of the separate states with the confederation government, i.e. &quot;Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.&quot;
# Does not call the United States of America a &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;government,&quot; but instead says, &quot;The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.&quot;
# Establishes [[freedom of movement]] – anyone could pass freely between the states, excluding &quot;[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.&quot; All people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
# Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the &quot;United States in Congress Assembled&quot;) to each state, which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress were appointed by state legislatures. Also, individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years.
# Only the central government was allowed to conduct [[diplomacy|foreign relations]] and to [[declaration of war|declare war]]. No states could have navies or standing armies, or engage in war, without permission of Congress (although the existence of state [[militia]]s is encouraged).
# Whenever an army is raised for common defense, [[Colonel (United States)|colonels]] and [[military rank]]s below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
# Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
# Defines the powers of the United States of America: to declare war, to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.
# Defines a [[Committee of the States]] to be a government when Congress is not in session.
# Requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy. It pre-approved [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|eastern Canada]], if it had applied for membership.
# Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the existence of the Articles.
# Declares that the Articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by all the state legislatures.

While still at war with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the Founding Fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government, and those seeking a loosely structured one. Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the Federal government, with a [[unicameral]] legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or revenue. At times, this left the military in a precarious position, as [[George Washington]] wrote in a letter in 1781 to the Governor of [[Massachusetts]], [[John Hancock]].

==The end of the Revolutionary War==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it. Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Writing to [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] in September 1783, George Washington complained:

:''Congress have come to no determination ''yet'' respecting the Peace Establishment nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss ''Great'' National points.''&lt;ref name=washingtonclinton&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field(DOCID+@lit(gw270170)) Letter George Washington to George Clinton], September 11, 1783. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gwhtml/gwhome.html The George Washington Papers, 1741-1799]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
===The Army===
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the [[Continental Army]], and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:

{{quote|George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick p. 469. Phelps pp. 165-166. Phelps wrote:
:&quot;It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783 - 84. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.&lt;ref&gt;Puls pp. 174-176&lt;/ref&gt; Knox wrote:

{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, &quot;A hoop to the barrel&quot; or &quot;Cement to the Union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puls p. 177&quot;&gt;Puls p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, &quot;As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puls p. 177&quot; /&gt;

Once the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Keith L. Dougherty, &quot;An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775-1783,&quot; ''Social Science History'', Spring 2009, Vol. 33 Issue 1, pp 47-74,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1786, [[Thomas Jefferson]], concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary pirates]], wrote to [[James Monroe]], &quot;It will be said there is no money in the treasury. There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth. The states must see the rod.”&lt;ref&gt;Ellis 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the [[Jay-Gardoqui Treaty]] with [[Spain]] in 1786 also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty - which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity - the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 30 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil - forts which the British promised to leave in 1783. This violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] was corrected by [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795 under the new [[U.S. Constitution]].

===Taxation and commerce===
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures. 

Congress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, &quot;that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45&amp;nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were &quot;the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Americans should avoid having it said &quot;that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent&quot; or that &quot;her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.

Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.

===Accomplishments of the Confederation===
Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with longlasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states, the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.

The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1772 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cessions|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states, and part of a sixth to the Union. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.

To be specific, these states gave up all of their claims to land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania: [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]]. From this land, over several decades were formed the new states of [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River.

By the Land Ordinance of 1785, these were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 [[square mile]]s), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s.) This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.

==America under the articles==
The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president and no national court. The Articles of Confederation were weak and did not give a strong political or economic base for the newly formed nation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789'' (1988), is the standard scholarly history&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.

By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786-87 the [[Shay's Rebellion]], an uprising of farmers in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.

The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression &quot;not worth a continental&quot;. Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.

When Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.

By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Rakove, &quot;The Collapse of the Articles of Confederation,&quot; in ''The American Founding: Essays on the Formation of the Constitution'' ed. by J. Jackson Barlow, Leonard W. Levy and Ken Masugi (1988) pp 225–45&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor. [[Alexander Hamilton]] realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signatures==
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. The copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and a cover letter had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.

The ''Articles'', however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the ''Articles'' on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the ''Articles'' on July 21, 1778.

The other states had to wait until they ratified the ''Articles'' and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the ''Articles'' until every state had ceded its western land claims.

On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]].&lt;ref name=lawsofmaryland&gt;[http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html Friday, February 2, 1781], Laws of Maryland, 1781.

The Senate then adjourned &quot;to the first Monday in August next.&quot; The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The formal signing of the ''Articles'' by the Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles entered into force and the United States came into being as a united, sovereign and national state.

Congress had debated the ''Articles'' for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The ''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union'' were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.

The signers and the states they represented were:
* [[New Hampshire]]: [[Josiah Bartlett]] and [[John Wentworth Jr.]]
* [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts Bay]]: [[John Hancock]], [[Samuel Adams]], [[Elbridge Gerry]], [[Francis Dana]], [[James Lovell (delegate)|James Lovell]], and [[Samuel Holten]]
* [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]: [[William Ellery]], [[Henry Marchant]], and [[John Collins (delegate)|John Collins]]
* [[Connecticut]]: [[Roger Sherman]], [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]], [[Oliver Wolcott]], [[Titus Hosmer]], and [[Andrew Adams (congressman)|Andrew Adams]]
* [[New York State|New York]]: [[James Duane]], [[Francis Lewis]], [[William Duer (delegate)|William Duer]], and [[Gouverneur Morris]]
* [[New Jersey]]: [[John Witherspoon]] and [[Nathaniel Scudder]]
* [[Pennsylvania]]: [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]], [[Daniel Roberdeau]], [[Jonathan Bayard Smith]], [[William Clingan]], and [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]]
* [[Delaware]]: [[Thomas McKean]], [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], and [[Nicholas Van Dyke (governor)|Nicholas Van Dyke]]
* [[Maryland]]: [[John Hanson]] and [[Daniel Carroll]]
* [[Virginia]]: [[Richard Henry Lee]], [[John Banister (lawyer)|John Banister]], [[Thomas Adams (politician)|Thomas Adams]], [[John Harvie]], and [[Francis Lightfoot Lee]]
* [[North Carolina]]: [[John Penn (delegate)|John Penn]], [[Cornelius Harnett]], and [[John Williams (delegate)|John Williams]]
* [[South Carolina]]: [[Henry Laurens]], [[William Henry Drayton]], [[John Mathews (lawyer)|John Mathews]], [[Richard Hutson]], and [[Thomas Heyward Jr.]]
* [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]: [[John Walton (1738–1783)|John Walton]], [[Edward Telfair]], and [[Edward Langworthy]]

Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the [[Continental Association]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) was the only person besides Sherman to sign three of the great state papers of the United States: the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

John Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).

==Presidents of the Congress==
The following list is of those who led the [[Congress of the Confederation]] under the ''Articles of Confederation'' as the [[President of the United States in Congress Assembled|Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled]]. Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the the [[Committee of the States]] when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Jensen, ''The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774–1781'' (1959) pp 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] (March 1, 1781 – July 9, 1781)
* [[Thomas McKean]] (July 10, 1781 – November 4, 1781)
* [[John Hanson]] (November 5, 1781 – November 3, 1782)
* [[Elias Boudinot]] (November 4, 1782 – November 2, 1783)
* [[Thomas Mifflin]] (November 3, 1783 – October 31, 1784)
* [[Richard Henry Lee]] (November 30, 1784 – November 6, 1785)
* [[John Hancock]] (November 23, 1785 – May 29, 1786)
* [[Nathaniel Gorham]] (June 6, 1786 – November 5, 1786)
* [[Arthur St. Clair]] (February 2, 1787 – November 4, 1787)
* [[Cyrus Griffin]] (January 22, 1788 – November 2, 1788)

==Revision and replacement==
In May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.

On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following [[James Madison|James Madison's]] recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce these interstate conflicts. At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a &quot;Grand Convention.&quot; Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get as close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:

{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|antifederalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:

{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the &quot;consolidated government&quot; proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a &quot;splendid empire&quot; that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Ketcham, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&amp;pg=PA381&amp;lpg=PA381&amp;dq=ralph+ketcham+%22anti+federalist%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BQZCnGjA9c&amp;sig=rVp_ZBF9cEFFN8R5yJsW2xTMyf0#PPA381,M1 Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted, pg. 383]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures &quot;stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rakove 1988 p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new &quot;merchant state,&quot; much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that &quot;the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson p. 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing down===
According to their own terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states ratified the new Constitution.&lt;!---this is not POV or SYNTH, this is apparent from a simple reading of article 13 --&gt;
The Congress under the Articles continued to sit until November 1788, overseeing the adoption of the new Constitution by the states, and setting elections.&lt;ref&gt;

By that date, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.
On September 13, 1788, it published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Atlantic Ocean - en.png|thumb|The Atlantic Ocean, not including [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions]]
{{Five oceans}}
The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the second-largest of the world's [[ocean]]ic divisions. With a total [[area]] of about {{convert|106,400,000|km2|sqmi}}, it covers approximately twenty percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and about twenty-six percent of its [[water]] surface area. The first part of its name refers to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], making the Atlantic the &quot;Sea of Atlas&quot;.

The oldest known mention of &quot;Atlantic&quot; is in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): ''Atlantis thalassa'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: Sea of Atlas); see also: ''[[Atlas Mountains]]''. The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from [[Ethiopia]], was applied to the southern Atlantic ocean as late as the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana|title=The American cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ROQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=1873|publisher=Appleton|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term &quot;ocean&quot; itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] that we now know as the Atlantic.  The Greeks believed this ocean to be a [[Oceanus|gigantic river encircling the world]].

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between the [[Americas]] to the west, and [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] to the east. As one component of the interconnected [[World Ocean|global ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]] (which is sometimes considered a sea of the Atlantic), to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south. (Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]].) The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and '''South Atlantic Ocean'''.

==Geography==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|250px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the western coast of [[Portugal]]|alt=Photo of surf breaking on rocky shore]]
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are [[Europe]]; the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] –one of its [[marginal sea]]s– and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]]) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]] defines its border. Some authorities show it extending south to [[Antarctica]], while others show it bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iodeweb5.vliz.be/oceanteacher/index.php?module=contextview&amp;action=contextdownload&amp;id=gen11Srv32Nme37_366 ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'']. International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southwest, the [[Drake Passage]] connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The [[wikt:man-made|man-made]] [[Panama Canal]] links the Atlantic and Pacific. Besides those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the [[Caribbean Sea]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; [[Hudson Bay]]; the Arctic Ocean; the Mediterranean Sea; the [[North Sea]]; the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Celtic Sea]].

Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific. With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about {{convert|106400000|km2|sqmi}}; without them, it has an area of {{convert|82400000|km2|sqmi}}. The land that drains into the Atlantic covers four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometers (85,100,000&amp;nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&amp;nbsp;cu mi).

The average depth of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is {{convert|3339|m|ft}}; without them it is {{convert|3926|m|ft}}. The greatest depth, [[Milwaukee Deep]] with {{convert|8605|m|ft}}, is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].

==Cultural significance==
{{expand section|date=October 2010}}
[[Transatlantic crossing|Transatlantic travel]] played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas. It is the Atlantic that separates the &quot;[[Old World]]&quot; from the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;. In [[modern history|modern times]], some [[idiom]]s refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as '''the Pond''', describing both the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe, in particular between the [[English language|English]]-speaking nations of both continents. Many British people refer to the USA and Canada as &quot;across the pond&quot;, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Example: BBC Click - Episode 04 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean bottom==
[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Atlantic [[bathymetry]]|Map that uses color to show ocean depth]]
The principal feature of the [[bathymetry]] (bottom [[topography]]) is a [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine mountain range]] called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Hsü, Kenneth J. (1992) Challenger at Sea, Princeton, Princeton University Press, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately 58° South latitude, reaching a maximum width of about {{convert|1600|km|mi}}. A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than {{convert|2700|m|ft}} in most places, the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep and of course several peaks rise above the water and form islands.&lt;ref&gt;The Mediterranean Was a Desert&quot; by Kenneth J. Hsü, illustration 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the [[Walvis Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Atlas of the World: Revised Sixth Edition, National Geographic Society, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths from {{convert|3700|-|5500|m|ft}}. Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the [[Blake Basin|Blake]], Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, [[abyssal plains]], [[oceanic trench|trenches]], [[seamount]]s, [[Oceanic basin|basins]], [[Oceanic plateau|plateaus]], [[Submarine canyon|canyons]], and some [[guyot]]s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean floor trenches and seamounts:
*[[Puerto Rico Trench]], in the North Atlantic, is the deepest trench at {{convert|8605|m|ft}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sea-seek.com/site/Milwaukee_Deep&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]
*[[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of {{convert|8428|m|ft}}
*[[Romanche Trench]] is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about {{convert|7454|m|ft}}.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of:
*[[Terrigenous]] deposits with land origins, consisting of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by [[erosion]], [[weathering]], and volcanic activity on land washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts.
*[[Pelagic]] deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerinida|Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from {{convert|60|-|3300|m|ft}} they are thickest in the convergence belts, notably at the [[Hamilton Ridge]] and in upwelling zones.
*[[Authigenic]] deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits, such as in the [[Hewett Curve]].

==Water characteristics==
[[File:Circulacion termohalina.jpg|Path of the [[thermohaline circulation]]. Purple paths represent deep-water currents, while blue paths represent surface currents.|thumb|alt=Map displaying a looping line with arrows indicating that water flows eastward in the far Southern ocean, angling north east of Australia, turning sough after passing Alaska, then crossing the mid-Pacific to flow north of Australia, continuing west below Africa, then turning northwest until reaching eastern Canada, then angling east to southern Europe, then finally turning south just below Greenland and flowing down the Americas' eastern coast, and resuming its flow eastward to complete the circle]]
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major ocean gyres|alt=Map showing 5 circles. The first is between western Australia and eastern Africa. The second is between eastern Australia and western South America. The third is between Japan and western North America. Of the two in the Atlantic, one is in hemisphere.]]
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water [[salinity]] in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 - 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and [[sea ice]] melting influence surface salinity values. Although the salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south, in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below {{convert|−2|C|F}}. Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7-8 °C (12-15 °F).

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters make up the surface. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}. The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] reaches depths of as much as {{convert|4000|m|ft}}. The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 meters.

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate the [[Sargasso Sea]], a large elongated body of water, with above average salinity. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for both the [[European eel]] and the [[American eel]].

The [[Coriolis effect]] circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[File:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|right|Waves in the [[trade wind]]s in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.|alt=Map of Caribbean showing 7 approximately parallel westward-pointing arrows that extend from east of the Virgin Islands to Cuba. The southern arrows bend northward just east of the Dominican Republic before straightening out again.]]

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great heat retention capacity, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.

The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Animation of showing the separation of [[Pangaea]], which formed the Atlantic Ocean known today|alt=Animation showing the continents separating from a single mass, making creating the Atlantic in the process]]
:''See also:'' [[:Category:History of the Atlantic Ocean|History of the Atlantic Ocean]]
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans. It did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent [[Pangaea]] were drifting apart from seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores.

The [[Viking]]s, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and the Spaniards were the most famous among early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.

As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the [[Americas]] (known as transatlantic trade). Scientific explorations include the [[Challenger expedition]], the [[German Meteor expedition]], [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and the [[United States Navy]] [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]].

===Notable crossings===
[[File:RaII.InMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ra II]], a ship built from [[papyrus]], was successfully sailed across the Atlantic by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] proving that it was possible to cross the Atlantic from Africa using such boats in early epochs of history.]]

*In 1000, the Icelander, [[Leif Ericson]] was the first European to discover North America's Atlantic coast, including [[Vinland]]. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] discovery was documented in the 13th century [[Icelandic Sagas]] and was corroborated by recent [[L'Anse aux Meadows|L'Anse aux Meadows archeological evidence]].

*1939-1945, the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic]]. Nearly 3,700 Allied ships were sunk at a cost of 783 German [[U-boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Introduction&quot; ''U-Boat Operations of the Second World War—Vol 1'' by Wynn, Kenneth, 1998 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1952, [[Ann Davison]] was the first woman to single-handedly [[sail]] the Atlantic Ocean.
* In 1969 and 1970 [[Thor Heyerdahl]] launched expeditions to cross the Atlantic in boats built from [[papyrus]]. He succeeded in crossing the Atlantic from [[Morocco]] to [[Barbados]] after a two-month voyage of 6,100&amp;nbsp;km with [[Ra II]] in 1970, thus conclusively proving that boats such as the Ra could have sailed with the [[Canary Current]] across the Atlantic in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;Ryne, Linn.[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081221173610/http://www.norway.org/history/expolorers/heyerdahl/heyerdahl.htm].

*In 1999, after rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962&amp;nbsp;mi), [[Tori Murden]] became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by [[rowboat]] alone when she reached [[Guadeloupe]] from the [[Canary Islands]].

==Ethiopic Ocean==
The '''[[Aethiopian Sea]]''', '''Ethiopic Ocean''' or '''Ethiopian Ocean''' (Okeanos Aithiopos), is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean, which is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between [[Natal, Brazil]] and [[Monrovia, Liberia]].  The use of this term illustrates a past trend towards referring to the whole continent of [[Africa]] by the name ''[[Name of Ethiopia|Aethiopia]]''.  The modern nation of Ethiopia, in northeast Africa, is nowhere near the Ethiopic Ocean, which would be said to lie off the west coast of Africa. The term Ethiopian Ocean sometimes appeared until the mid-19th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Economy==
The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves. The Atlantic hosts the world's richest [[fishing]] resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major fish are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]].

The most productive areas include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]'s [[Grand Banks]], the [[Nova Scotia]] shelf , [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the [[Bahama Banks]], the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s appear in great quantities. Because environmental threats from oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the [[incineration]] of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution. &lt;!-- This would be good if it were in an infobox

'''Climate:'''
Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the Caribbean Sea or up the east coast of [[North America]]; hurricanes can occur from May to December but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.
--&gt;

==Terrain==
From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and Baltic Sea. A clockwise warm-water [[gyre]] occupies the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern Atlantic. The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] , a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]] dominates the ocean floor. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it.

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Norwegian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Caribbean Sea]].

Islands include [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Great Britain]] (including numerous surrounding islands), [[Ireland]], [[Rockall]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Sable Island]], [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Caribbean]], [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Annobón Province]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|The Islands of Trindad]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Gough Island]] (Also known as Diego Alvarez), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[Bouvet Island]].

===Natural resources===
The Atlantic harbors [[petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], [[marine mammal]]s ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), [[sand]] and [[gravel]] aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], and precious stones.

===Natural hazards===
[[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]
[[Iceberg]]s are common from February to August in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and [[Madeira]]. Ships are subject to [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The United States' southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs. The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but [[Coast Guard]] records do not support this belief.
{{Clear}}

==Current environmental issues==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. [[Drift net]] fishing can kill [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus12bcenvtlafflrev473.htm animallaw.info: Problems and Prospects for the Pelagic Driftnet]&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal pollution comes from the eastern [[United States]], southern [[Brazil]], and eastern [[Argentina]]; [[oil pollution]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]]; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, [[North Sea]], and Mediterranean Sea.

In 2005, there was some concern that warm northern European currents were slowing down, but no scientific consensus formed from that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5033329 Atlantic Ocean's 'Heat Engine' Chills Down] by Christopher Joyce. All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 30 Nov, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the [[manatee]] off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

===Marine pollution===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture [[fertilizer]] chemicals as well as [[livestock]] and [[human]] waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach: Marine Pollution, Springer, Berlin (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine debris]], which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

'''Arthur Schopenhauer''' (22 February 1788&amp;nbsp;– 21 September 1860) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] known for his [[pessimism]] and philosophical clarity. At age 25, he published his doctoral dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', which examined the four separate manifestations of reason in the phenomenal world.

Schopenhauer's most influential work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our [[will (philosophy)|will]]. His analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, he described a lifestyle of negating desires, similar to the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Vedanta]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and the [[Church Fathers]] of [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 48 (Dover page 616), &quot;The ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in [[Early Christianity|genuine and original Christianity]], as it was developed in the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] from the kernel of the [[New Testament]]; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] analysis of will, his views on human [[motivation]] and desire, and his [[aphorism|aphoristic]] writing style influenced many well-known thinkers including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref name=SchopBR&gt;Addressed in: Cate, Curtis. Friedrich Nietzsche. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Albert Einstein]],&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein in [http://www.einstein-website.de/z_biography/credo.html Mein Glaubensbekenntnis] (August 1932): &quot;I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants,[Der Mensch kann wohl tun, was er will, aber er kann nicht wollen, was er will]' accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper.&quot; Schopenhauer's clearer, actual words were: &quot;You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.&quot; [Du kannst ''tun'' was du ''willst'': aber du kannst in jedem gegebenen Augenblick deines Lebens nur ''ein'' Bestimmtes ''wollen'' und schlechterdings nichts anderes als dieses eine.] ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Ch. II.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Otto Rank]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[Jorge Luis Borges]].

== Life ==

Arthur Schopenhauer was born in the city of [[Danzig]] (now Gdańsk) as the son of Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer and [[Johanna Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Books&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fW5Dl-tUS_oC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+%2222+February%22|title=Chronology|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|coauthors=Günter Zöller, Eric F. J. Payne|year=1999|work=Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=xxx|accessdate=2008-09-05 | isbn=978-0-521-57766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; both descendants of wealthy German [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] families. When the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] acquired the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] city of Danzig in 1793, Schopenhauer's family moved to [[Hamburg]]. In 1805, Schopenhauer's father may have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990) page 12. &quot;There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Schopenhauer's mother Johanna moved to [[Weimar]], then the centre of [[German literature]], to pursue her writing career. After one year, Schopenhauer left the family business in Hamburg to join her.

Schopenhauer became a student at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in 1809. There he studied [[metaphysics]] and [[psychology]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of [[Aenesidemus (book)|''Aenesidemus'']], who advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In Berlin, from 1811 to 1812, he had attended lectures by the prominent post-Kantian philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and the theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].
[[File:ArthurSchopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Schopenhauer as a youth]]

In 1814, Schopenhauer began his seminal work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung''). He would finish it in 1818 and publish it the following year. In [[Dresden]] in 1819, Schopenhauer fathered an illegitimate child who was born and died the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/c_ansata/timeline.html |title=A Schopenhauer Timeline |publisher=Reocities.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/arthursc.htm |title=Arthur Schopenhauer |publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[University of Berlin]]. He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whom Schopenhauer described as a &quot;clumsy charlatan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenahuer, Arthur. Author's preface to &quot;On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of academia. A late essay, &quot;On University Philosophy&quot;, expressed his resentment towards university philosophy.

While in Berlin, Schopenhauer was named as a defendant in an action at law initiated by a woman named Caroline Marquet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Addressed in: Russell, Bertrand (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;
She asked for damages, alleging that Schopenhauer had pushed her. According to Schopenhauer's court testimony, she deliberately annoyed him by raising her voice while standing right outside his door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rudiger Safranski, Rüdiger Safranski, Ewald Osers |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DEOTiprvvHIC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=schopenhauer+marquet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W2Okkezuny&amp;sig=efaI_HY6oxuvAPmDMHwM3BZlm0w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rCcxS4XdFYqUkAWo4pCiDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=schopenhauer%20marquet&amp;f=false |title=Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy |pages=271–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marquet alleged that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway. Her companion testified that she saw Marquet prostrate outside his apartment. Because Marquet won the lawsuit, he made payments to her for the next twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; When she died, he wrote on a copy of her death certificate, ''Obit anus, abit onus'' (&quot;The old woman dies, the burden flies&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Magee | first = Bryan | title = The Philosophy of Schopenhauer | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-823723-5 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, he fell in love with nineteen-year old opera singer, Caroline Richter (called Medon), and had a relationship with her for several years. He discarded marriage plans, however, writing, &quot;Marrying means to halve one's rights and double one's duties&quot;, and &quot;Marrying means, to grasp blindfolded into a sack hoping to find out an eel out of an assembly of snakes.&quot; When he was forty-three years old, seventeen-year old Flora Weiss recorded rejecting him in her diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiw.kuleuven.be/eng/alumni/newslet11.pdf |title=The Leuven Philosophy Newsletter |pages=42–43 |publisher=Katholieke Universiteit Leuven}} &quot;But an examination of his life reveals a yearning for marriage frustrated by a train of rejections. In the year 1831, Schopenhauer fell in love with a girl named Flora Weiss. At a boat party in Germany he made his advance by offering her a bunch of grapes. Flora’s diary records this event as follows “I didn’t want the grapes because old Schopenhauer had touched them, so I let them slide, quite gently into the water.” Apparently, she was underwhelmed.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer had a notably strained relationship with his mother Johanna Schopenhauer. After his father's death, Arthur Schopenhauer endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant, in honor of his dead father. Afterward, his mother retired to Weimar, and Arthur Schopenhauer dedicated himself wholly to studies in the gymnasium of Gotha. After he left it in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned, he went to live with his mother. But by that time she had already opened her infamous salon, and Arthur was not compatible with the vain, ceremonious ways of the salon. He was also disgusted by the ease with which Johanna Schopenhauer had forgotten his father's memory. Therefore, he gave university life a shot. There, he wrote his first book, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. She informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur Schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the rubbish she wrote would have been totally forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: |publisher=Courseweb.stthomas.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of &quot;Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer&quot; |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic broke out in Berlin and Schopenhauer left the city. Schopenhauer settled permanently in [[Frankfurt]] in 1833, where he remained for the next twenty-seven years, living alone except for a succession of pet poodles named [[Atman]] and Butz. The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''.

Schopenhauer had a robust constitution, but in 1860 his health began to deteriorate. He died of heart failure on 21 September 1860, while sitting on his couch at home. He was 72.

== Thought ==
{{Synthesis|date=October 2007}}

=== Philosophy of the &quot;Will&quot; ===
A key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation. Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the idea that society consisted of a [[collective consciousness]] which moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members. Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason. Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated only by their own basic desires, or ''Wille zum Leben'' (Will to Live), which directed all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The reality is what Schopenhauer calls the Will, the Will to Live.&quot; Letter to Richard C. Lyon, 1 August 1949, [[George Santayana]], ''The Letters of George Santayana'', Scribner's, New York, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a metaphysical existence which controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena. Will, for Schopenhauer, is what Kant called the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;.

=== Art and aesthetics ===
{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}
For Schopenhauer, human desiring, &quot;willing,&quot; and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s &quot;''Sublimation''&quot;). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape, albeit temporarily, this pain because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated from, rather one becomes one with that perception &quot;''one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception''&quot; (The World as Will and Presentation, section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to their individual will but one becomes a &quot;''subject of cognition''&quot; to a perception that is, &quot;''Pure, will-less, timeless''&quot; (section 34) where the essence, &quot;ideas&quot;, of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, &quot;Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, page 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
Schopenhauer's moral theory proposed that of three primary moral incentives, [[compassion]],&lt;!--Only German &quot;Mitleid&quot; if others (malice and egoism) also have their German. Must be consistent: (''Mitleid'')--&gt; [[wikt:malice|malice]] and [[Ethical egoism|egoism]], compassion is the major motivator to moral expression. Malice and egoism are corrupt alternatives.

==== Punishment ====
According to Schopenhauer, whenever we make a choice, &quot;we assume as necessary that that decision was preceded by something from which it ensued, and which we call the ground or reason, or more accurately the motive, of the resultant action.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', § 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Choices are not made freely. Our actions are necessary and determined because &quot;every human being, even every animal, after the motive has appeared, must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', § 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a person's given, unchangeable character. If there is no free will, should crimes be punished?

The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals in order to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing &quot;beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter–motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined….&quot; &lt;ref name=twwr62&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|…the law and its fulfillment, namely punishment, are directed essentially to the ''future'', not to the ''past''. This distinguishes ''punishment'' from ''revenge'', for revenge is motivated by what has happened, and hence by the past as such. All retaliation for wrong by inflicting a pain without any object for the future is revenge, and can have no other purpose than consolation for the suffering one has endured by the sight of the suffering one has caused in another. Such a thing is wickedness and cruelty, and cannot be ethically justified. …the object of punishment…is deterrence from crime…. Object and purpose for the future distinguish punishment from revenge, and punishment has this object only when it is inflicted ''in fulfillment of a law''. Only in this way does it proclaim itself to be inevitable and infallible for every future case; and thus it obtains for the law the power to deter….&lt;ref name=twwr62/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Rée]], in his ''The Origin of Moral Sensation'', reflected Schopenhauer's concerns when he wrote: &quot;The feeling of justice thus arises out of two errors, namely, because the punishments inflicted by authorities and educators appear as acts of retribution, and because people believe in the freedom of the will.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Should capital punishment be legal? &quot;For safeguarding the lives of citizens,&quot; he asserted, &quot;capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVII.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;The murderer,&quot; wrote Schopenhauer, &quot; who is condemned to death according to the law must, it is true, be now used as a mere ''means'', and with complete right. For public security, which is the principal object of the State, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law remains unfulfilled. The murderer, his life, his person, must be the ''means'' of fulfilling the law, and thus of re–establishing public security.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer disagreed with those who would abolish capital punishment. &quot;Those who would like to abolish it should be given the answer: 'First remove murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to follow.' &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

People, according to Schopenhauer, cannot be improved. They can only be influenced by strong motives that overpower criminal motives.  Schopenhauer declared that &quot;real moral reform is not at all possible, but only determent from the deed….&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

He claimed that this doctrine was not original with him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;…he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.&quot; Plato, &quot;[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]&quot;, 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should &quot;be an example to other men not to offend.&quot; Plato, &quot;[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]&quot;, Book IX, 863.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]]. Schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification.&lt;ref name=&quot;twwr62&quot;/&gt;

=== Psychology ===
Schopenhauer was perhaps even more influential in his treatment of man's [[psychology]] than he was in the realm of philosophy.

Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Supplements to the Fourth Book of &quot;The World as Will and Representation, Page 338 [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He gave a name to a force within man which he felt had invariably precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (''Wille zum Leben''), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive and to reproduce.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and dramatically shaping the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Supplements to the Fourth Book of &quot;The World as Will and Representation. Page 340 [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These ideas foreshadowed [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[theory of evolution|discovery of evolution]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nearly a century before Freud... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body.&quot; Safranski pg. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's [[politics]] were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.

In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should &quot;leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]]&quot;, and so long as government was thus limited, he would &quot;prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats&quot; — i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer did, however, share the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species.

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid &quot;to political affairs of [his] day&quot;. In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of &quot;minding not the times but the eternities&quot;. He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, &quot;For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern &quot;white races&quot; due to their sensitivity and creativity (Except for the Egyptians and Hindus whom he saw as equal):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of &quot;[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches&quot; as &quot;belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', &quot;On Ethics,&quot; Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual &quot;self-conquest.&quot; This he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly Jewish spirit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fragments for the history of philosophy&quot;, ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Views on women ====
In Schopenhauer's 1851&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/c_ansata/wom.html  |title=? |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091027102704/http://geocities.com/c_ansata/wom.html |archivedate = 27 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; essay &quot;Of Women&quot; (&quot;Über die Weiber&quot;, [[s:Of Women|full text]]),  he expressed his opposition to what he called &quot;Teutonico-Christian stupidity&quot; on female affairs. He claimed that &quot;woman is by nature meant to obey&quot;, and opposed [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller's]] poem in honor of women, &quot;Würde der Frauen&quot; (&quot;Dignity of Women&quot;). The essay does give two compliments, however: that &quot;women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are&quot; and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others. However, the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue.

Schopenhauer's controversial writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''
PA Cain - Ga. L. Rev., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] in the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

After the elderly Schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by [[Elisabet Ney]], he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], &quot;I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. Page 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits one's level of intellect through one's mother, and personal character through one's father.&lt;ref&gt;On the Suffering of the World, (1970), Page 35. Penguin Books-Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer quotes Horace's saying, &quot;From the brave and good are the brave descended&quot; (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''Cymbeline'', &quot;Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base&quot; (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; On the question of eugenics, Schopenhauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E. F. J. Payne |volume=II | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-21762-8 |page=527 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or more kindly - “The final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation.… It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.”

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his antidemocratic-eugenic thesis: &quot;If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the [[despotism]] of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by [[mating]] the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's advocacy of anti-[[egalitarianism]] and eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.

==== Animal welfare ====
As a consequence of his philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals. For him, all animals, including humans, are phenomenal manifestations of Will. The word &quot;will&quot; designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since everything is basically Will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as that which is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.&quot; ''On the Will in Nature'', &quot;Physiology and Pathology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he, who is cruel to living creatures, cannot be a good man.&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun &quot;it&quot; in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&amp;hellip;in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like&amp;hellip;.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights,...in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.&quot; ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt; belief that animals are to be used as a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: &quot;Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours....&quot; This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, &quot;whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.&quot; ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Views on homosexuality and pederasty ====

Schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of [[Greek philosophy]] to address the subject of male homosexuality. In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1856), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the &quot;Metaphysics of Sexual Love&quot;. He also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated, &quot;... the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her, it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}. He wrote that only those who were too old or too young to reproduce strong, healthy children would resort to [[pederasty]] (Schopenhauer considered pederasty to be in itself a [[vice]]).&quot;The World as Will and Representation: Volume Two&quot;. Dover&lt;/ref&gt; Shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion on the part of the popular mind of his attempted scientific ''explanation'' of pederasty as a personal ''advocacy'' of a phenomenon Schopenhauer otherwise describes, in terms of spiritual ethics, as an &quot;objectionable aberration&quot;, Schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that &quot;by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour, for they are very disconcerted by the ever-increasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend [[pederasty]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual interests and affinities ===
==== Indology ====
Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the [[Upanisad|Upanishads]] which had been translated by French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] from the Persian translation of Prince Dara Shikoh entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (&quot;The Great Secret&quot;). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them &quot;the production of the highest human wisdom&quot;, and considered them to contain superhuman conceptions. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer, and writing about them he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is well known that the book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature &quot;the greatest gift of our century&quot;, and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin [[Upanishad]] translation through [[Friedrich Majer]].     They met during the winter of 1813-1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer’s mother according to the biographer Sanfranski.    Majer was a follower of [[Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]].     Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814.     Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian Thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]].    Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship.     It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer’s work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahavakya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]] is mentioned throughout [[The World as Will and Representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54-56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993).
[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West
Volume 43, Number 2,'' pp. 255-278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[tanha]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four &quot;truths of the Buddha&quot; correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable - it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Burton 2004, page 22&quot;&gt;David Burton, &quot;Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.&quot; Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddhist perspective, the enemy to be defeated is [[tanha|craving]] rather than desire in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Burton 2004, page 22&quot;/&gt;

For Schopenhauer, Will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[purushartha]] or goals of life in [[Vedanta]] [[Hinduism]].

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:

* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live
* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people

However, Buddhist [[nirvana]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirvana is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the &quot;extinguishing&quot; (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, page xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (1945- ) stated, &quot;It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', page 38. Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996, ISBN 978-0-932813-35-0, 9780932813350&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orientalism]] reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of [[Leon Poliakov]], to free themselves from [[Judeo-Christian]] fetters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Arktos'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Schopenhauer is often said to be the first, or indeed the only, modern Western philosopher of any note to attempt any integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14-15, 316-21). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]’’, Vol. 2, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument that [[Buddhism]] affected Schopenhauer’s philosophy more than any other [[Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App)  about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.&lt;ref&gt;
App, Urs [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp200_schopenhauer.pdf Arthur Schopenhauer and China. ''Sino-Platonic Papers'' Nr. 200 (April 2010)] (PDF, 8.7&amp;nbsp;Mb PDF, 164 p.; Schopenhauer's early notes on Buddhism reproduced in Appendix). This study provides an overview of the actual discovery of Buddhism by Schopenhauer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Schopenhauer said he was influenced by the [[Upanishads]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Plato]]. References to [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophy and religion]] appear frequently in Schopenhauer's writing. As noted above, he appreciated the teachings of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and even called himself a &quot;Buddhist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Abelsen, Peter (1993). [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96540080 &quot;Schopenhauer and Buddhism.&quot;] ''Philosophy East &amp; West,'' 44:2 p. 255. Retrieved on: 18 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He said&lt;ref&gt;''Schopenhauer and Buddhism''. P Abelsen, H Amsterdam, A Schopenhauer - ''Philosophy East &amp; West'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  that his philosophy could not have been conceived before these teachings were available.

Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He summarised the influence of the Upanishads thus: &quot;It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death!&quot;

=== Criticism of Kant ===
{{Main|Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy}}
{{See also|On the Basis of Morality|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}
Schopenhauer accepted Kant's double-aspect of the universe—the [[phenomena]]l (world of experience) and the [[noumenon|noumenal]] (the true world, independent of experience). Some commentators suggest that Schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, was the basis for Schopenhauer's concept of the [[will (philosophy)|will]]. Other commentators suggest that Schopenhauer considered [[will (philosophy)|will]] to be only a subset of the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; class, namely that which we can most directly experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Magee, ''Misunderstanding Schopenhauer'', Institute of Germanic Studies, University of London, 1990, ISBN 978-0-85457-148-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian ''noumenon'' (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed &quot;will&quot; deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the ''Ding an Sich'', the &quot;Thing in Itself&quot;, the reality that is the foundation of our [[sense|sensory]] and [[mind|mental]] representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed phenomena and noumena to be two different sides of the same coin. Noumena do not ''cause'' phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.

Schopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical [[philosophical skepticism]] of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.

We know our [[human anatomy|human bodies]] have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results – we know this even if we do not understand the [[physics]] involved.

We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually are not aware of the breathing of our [[lung]]s or the beating of our [[heart]] unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our [[kidney]]s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our [[liver]] is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs; these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.

When Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name &quot;will,&quot; what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot ''prove'' that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know – without thinking – that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with what we call our will.

In his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities. Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them. Kant wrote: &quot;… [T]here are two stems of human knowledge ... namely, sensibility and understanding, objects being given by the former [sensibility] and thought by the latter [understanding].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 15&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer disagreed. He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility. According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to &quot;why?&quot;). Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique.

Lastly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the [[Platonic forms|Platonic ideas]].  In [[The World as Will and Representation]] Schopenhauer explicitly stated:

...Kant used the word [Idea] wrongly  as well as illegitimately, although Plato had already taken possession of it, and used it most appropriately.

Instead Schopenhauer relied upon the [[Neoplatonist]] interpretation of the biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] from [[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]].
In reference to Plato’s Ideas, Schopenhauer quotes Laërtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote.

Diogenes Laërtius (III, 12) Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem consistencia.
(Plato teaches that the Ideas exist in nature, so to speak, as patterns or prototypes, and that the remainder of things only resemble them, and exist as their copies.)&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Christopher Patrick. 2009. Thou Art That: Schopenhauer's Philosophy and the Chandogya Upanishad. Master's thesis, James Madison University: 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of Hegel ===
Schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] many times in his published works. The following quotations are typical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a [[pseudophilosophy|pseudo-philosophy]] paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus [...] scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of the Mind]]'', without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], I should be no less right.&lt;ref&gt;[[On the Basis of Morality]], pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first Fichte and Schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch; to be followed by the man who is quite unworthy even of them, and greatly their inferior in point of talent --- I mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[On the Basis of Morality]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his Foreword to the first edition of his work ''[[Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik]]'', Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.

Schopenhauer thought that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage. He suggested his works were filled with &quot;castles of abstraction&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;orientalia.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalia.org/wisdom/Philosophy/Pseudophilosophy.shtml |title=Philosophy: Pseudophilosophy |publisher=Orientalia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sounded impressive but ultimately had no content. He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with the search for philosophical [[truth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;orientalia.org&quot;/&gt; For instance, the [[Right Hegelians]] interpreted Hegel as viewing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... the Hegelians who, in complete unsmiling seriousness, were airing the question of what the further content of world history could possibly be, now that in the Hegelian philosophy the world spirit had reached the goal, the knowledge of itself.&quot; Safranski, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer by Wilhelm Busch.jpeg|thumb|180px|right|Caricature of Schopenhauer by [[Wilhelm Busch]] (1832–1908).]]

Schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers, though more so in the [[arts]] (especially [[literature]] and [[music]]) and [[psychology]] than in philosophy. His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century, especially during the [[Modernist]] era, and waned somewhat thereafter. Nevertheless, a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer. His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to [[evolutionary theory]] and modern evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;In the book ''Straw Dogs'', John Gray upheld Schopenhauer as one of the few philosophers who has dedicated himself to studying Eastern philosophy as well as Western philosophy. The book argues against free will, and states that humans have much more in common with animals than is commonly admitted in the West. Schopenhauer is praised for his attitude towards animals, and for having addressed the brutality of much of human life.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Magee|1997|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's influence on literature can  be seen in Clifford Odets' 1937 Play &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, where  the character of Mr Carp mentions Schopenhauer and his theories in a contradiction of &quot;The American Dream&quot; sought after by the play's other characters.

'''Angola''', officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola}}, {{IPA-pt|ʁɨˈpublikɐ dɨ ɐ̃ˈɡɔla|pron}} &lt;ref&gt; This is the pronunciation in Portugal; in Angola it is pronounced as it is written&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]]: Repubilika ya Ngola), is a country in south-central [[Africa]] bordered by [[Namibia]] on the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on the north, and [[Zambia]] on the east; its west coast is on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with [[Luanda]] as its capital city. The [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] has a border with the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

Angola was a [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] from the 16th century to 1975. After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense [[Angolan Civil War|civil war from 1975 to 2002]]. The country has vast [[mineral]] and [[petroleum]] reserves; however, its [[life expectancy]] and [[infant mortality]] rates are both among the worst-ranked in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html,  Life expectancy at birth], [[www.cia.gov]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Angola}}

=== Early migrations and political units ===
[[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area. They were largely replaced by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] [[tribe]]s during the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]], though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day. The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day [[Cameroon|Republic of Cameroon]]. When they reached what is now Angola, they encountered the Khoisan, Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced than themselves, whom they easily dominated with their superior knowledge of metal-working, ceramics and agriculture. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics.

During this period of time, the Bantu established a number of political units (&quot;kingdoms&quot;, &quot;empires&quot;) in most parts of what today is Angola. The best known of these is the [[Kingdom of the Kongo]] that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included importante regions in the west of present day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Republic of Congo]] as well as in southern [[Gabon]].  It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilizations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the [[Great Zimbabwe]] [[Mutapa Empire]], but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade. &lt;ref name=&quot;The Story of Africa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page45.shtml |title=The Story of Africa |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portuguese rule ===
{{Main|Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese West Africa}}
The geographical areas now designated as Angola first became subject to incursions by the Portuguese in the late 15th century. In 1483, when Portugal established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] State, [[Ndongo]] and [[Lunda]] existed. The Kongo State stretched from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. Angola became a link in European trade with India and Southeast Asia. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded [[Luanda]] in 1575 as &quot;São Paulo de Loanda&quot;, with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers.

[[Benguela]], a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled. The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of current-day Angola, which relied on [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]], commerce in raw materials, and exchange of goods for survival. The [[African slave trade]] provided a large number of black slaves to Europeans and their African agents. For example, in what is now Angola, the [[Imbangala]] economy was heavily focused on the slave trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boahen|first=Adu Boahen|title=Topics In West African History|page=110|isbn=0582645026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|author=Kwaku Person-Lynn|year=|url=http://www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrikan_involvement.htm|title=Afrikan Involvement In Atlantic Slave Trade|accessdate=2007-11-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214124402/http%3A//www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrikan_involvement.htm |archivedate = December 14, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves. Within the [[Portuguese Empire]], most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations. This trade would last until the first half of the 19th century. According to John Iliffe, &quot;Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Iliffe (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent'']. Cambridge University Press. p.68. ISBN 0521682975&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|[[Queen Nzinga]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657.]]

The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars forming the Portuguese colony of Angola. Taking advantage of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] occupied Luanda from 1641 to 1648, where they allied with local peoples, consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance. In 1648, a fleet under the command of [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories, which restored Portugal to its former possessions by 1650. Treaties regulated relations with [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] in 1649 and Njinga's Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last great Portuguese expansion, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Portugal expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela in the 18th century, and began the attempt to occupy other regions in the mid-19th century.

The process resulted in few gains until the 1880s. Development of the hinterland began after the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885 fixed the colony's borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced labour systems. Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not occur until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1951, the colony was designated as an overseas province, called [[Overseas Province of Angola]]. Portugal had a presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and the population's initial reaction to calls for independence was mixed. More overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s, and began to make organised demands for their rights, especially in international forums such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]], meanwhile, refused to accede to the [[nationalists]]' demands for [[independence]], provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola. The war came to be known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. In this struggle, the principal protagonists were the MPLA ([[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]]), founded in 1956, the FNLA ([[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]]), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA ([[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'état]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by [[Marcelo Caetano]].

Portugal's [[Movimento das Forças Armadas|new revolutionary leaders]] began a process of democratic change at home and acceptance of its former colonies' independence abroad. These events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]), creating over a million destitute Portuguese [[refugee]]s&amp;nbsp;— the ''[[White African#Portuguese in Africa|retornados]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, July 07, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independence and civil war ===
{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Angolan Civil War}}
{{See|1980s in Angola|1990s in Angola}}

After independence in November 1975, Angola faced a devastating [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and [[refugee]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norrie MacQueen&quot;&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0001-9909(199804)97%3A387%3C276%3ATDOPAM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C The Decolonization of Portuguese Africa: Metropolitan Revolution and the Dissolution of Empire by Norrie MacQueen – Mozambique since Independence: Confronting Leviathan by Margaret Hall, Tom Young – Author of Review: Stuart A. Notholt African Affairs, Vol. 97, No. 387 (Apr., 1998), pp. 276–278], [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Alvor Agreement|negotiations held in Portugal]], itself under severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the April 1974 revolution, Angola's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975.

Within two months, however, the [[FNLA]], [[MPLA]] and [[UNITA]] were fighting each other and the country was well on its way to being divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The superpowers were quickly drawn into the conflict, which became a flash point for the [[Cold War]]. The [[United States]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) and [[South Africa]] supported the FNLA and UNITA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm |title=Americas Third World War: How 6 million People Were killed in CIA secret wars against third world countries |publisher=Informationclearinghouse.info |date=1981-11-16 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8 |title=CIA &amp; Angolan Revolution 1975 Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] supported the MPLA.

During most of this period, 1975–1990, the MPLA organised and maintained a political regime inspired by the &quot;socialist countries&quot; then in existence, as well as a centrally planned economy. Despite the ongoing civil war, the model functioned to a certain degree, although it was foreseeable that it would eventually fail.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Bhagavan, ''Angola's Political Economy 1975 - 1985'', Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceasefire with UNITA ===
{{Main|2000s in Angola}}
On February 22, 2002, [[Jonas Savimbi]], the leader of [[UNITA]], was killed in combat with government troops, and a cease-fire was reached by the two factions. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize, President Dos Santos has so far refused to institute regular democratic processes. Among Angola's major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of [[minefield]]s, and the actions of guerrilla movements fighting for the independence of the northern [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] ([[Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda]]). While most of the internally displaced have now returned home, the general situation for most Angolans remains desperate, and the development facing the government challenging as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Lari (2004), Human Rights Watch (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
[[File:Embassy of Angola (Washington, D.C.).JPG|thumb|[[Embassy]] of Angola in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
{{Main|Politics of Angola}}
{{See also|List of political parties in Angola||Foreign relations of Angola|List of diplomatic missions of Angola}}

Angola's motto is ''Virtus Unita Fortior'', a [[Latin]] phrase meaning &quot;Virtue is stronger when united.&quot; The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.

Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until 2010, despite statutory authorization.

After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character.&lt;ref&gt;See Didier Péclard (ed.), ''L'Angola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions'', special issue of ''Politique africains'' (Paris), 110, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angolan legislative election, 2008|Parliamentary elections]] held on 5 September 2008, announced MPLA as the winning party with 81% of votes. The closest opposition party was UNITA with 10%. These elections were the first since 1992 and were described as only partly free but certainly not as fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anton Bösl |url=http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2008/dokument_id-15323/index.html |title=Angola´s Parliamentary Elections in 2008, Publications, Namibia Office, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V |publisher=Kas.de |date=2009-02-26 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2009/dokument_id-17396/index.html |title=Angola - White Book on the 2009 elections, Publications, Namibia Office, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V |publisher=Kas.de |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola scored poorly on the 2008 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]]. It was ranked 44 from 48 [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/ |title=Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Mo Ibrahim Foundation |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution, adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime. In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and vice-president of Angola.&lt;ref&gt;In this manner, [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] is now finally in a legal situation. As he had obtained a relative, but not the absolute majority of votes in the 1992 presidential election, a second round  - opposing him to [[Jonas Savimbi]]  - was constitutionally necessary to make his election effective, but he preferred never to hold this second round.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a variety of mechanisms, the state president controls all the other organs of the state, so that the principle of the division of power is not maintained. As a consequence, Angola has no longer a presidential system, in the sense of the systems existing e.g. in the USA or in France. In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, its regime falls now in the same category as the &quot;cesarist&quot; monarchy of [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] in France, as [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s &quot;corporatist&quot; system established by the Portuguese constitution of 1933, as the Brazilian military dictatorship based on the constitution of 1967/69, or as several authoritarian regimes in contemporary Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See Jorge Miranda, ''A Constituição de Angola de 2010'', published in the academic journal ''O Direito'' (Lisbon), vol. 142, 2010 - 1 (June).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Angolan Armed Forces}}
The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and [[National Air Force of Angola|National Air Force]] (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000. Its equipment includes [[Russia]]n-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

== Police ==
The National Police departments are: Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for police operations. The National Police are also developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The National Police has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 Taxation and Frontier Supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 Economic Activity Inspectors.

The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganization; modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of AKM rifles with 9&amp;nbsp;mm UZIs for police officers in urban areas.

=== Exclave of Cabinda ===
{{Main|Cabinda (province)|l1=Cabinda|Republic of Cabinda}}
With an area of approximately {{convert|7283|km2|sqmi}}, the Northern Angolan province of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] is unique in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some {{convert|60|km}} wide, of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) along the lower [[Congo river]]. Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, &quot;the Kuwait of Africa&quot;. Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output. Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Africa|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independentist groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its military forces, the FAA&amp;nbsp;– Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The Cabindan separatists, FLEC-FAC, announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions, in a process which although not totally fomented by the Angolan government, is undoubtedly encouraged and duly exploited by it.

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Angola}}
[[File:Luanda from Fortaleza Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|Luanda, Angola]]
Transport in Angola consists of:
* Three separate [[railway]] systems totalling 2,761&amp;nbsp;km (1,715 mi)
* {{convert|76626|km|0|abbr=on}} of [[highway]] of which {{convert|19156|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved
* 1,295 navigable inland waterways
* Eight major [[sea port]]s
* 243 [[airport]]s, of which 32 are paved.

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

It is comparable in size to [[Mali]] and is nearly twice the size of the US state of [[Texas]], or five times the area of the [[United Kingdom]]. It lies mostly between latitudes [[4th parallel south|4°]] and [[18th parallel south|18°S]], and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[24th meridian east|24°E]].

Angola is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, [[Zambia]] to the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north-east, and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] also borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the north. Angola's capital, [[Luanda]], lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country.

Angola's average temperature on the coast is {{convert|60|F|C}} in the winter and {{convert|70|F|C}} in the summer. It has two seasons; dry season (May to October) and hot rainy season (November to April).

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Angola}}

Angola's economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During 2001-2010 Angola has the world's biggest [[Annual average GDP growth]] with 11.1 percent. In 2004, China's [[Eximbank]] approved a $2&amp;nbsp;billion line of credit to Angola. The loan is being used to rebuild Angola's infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=|url=http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=460&amp;language_id=1|title=The Increasing Importance of African Oil|work=Power and Interest Report|date=March 20, 2006}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 percent of Angola's economy, almost all of the country's revenue and are its dominate exports.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]. August 30, 2008 edition. U.S. Edition. Page 46. Article on Angola, &quot;marches toward riches and democracy?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth is almost entirely driven by rising [[Extraction of petroleum|oil production]] which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} in late-2005 and was expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} by 2007. Control of the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of [[OPEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angola: Country Admitted As Opec Member|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200612140990.html|date=2006-12-14|publisher=Angola Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007. However, due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated -0.3% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html retrieved 2010-10-24&lt;/ref&gt; The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4&amp;nbsp;million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.

[[File:Luanda1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luanda]] is Angola's capital city and [[economic]] and [[commerce|commercial]] hub]]

Although the country's economy has developed very significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of [[Angolan civil war|civil war]]. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of &quot;neo-patrimonial&quot; practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of a pervasive corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-corruption watchdog [[Transparency International]] rates Angola one of the 10 most [[Political corruption|corrupt]] countries in the world.&lt;/ref&gt; The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since 1975, but mainly during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic, and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth.&lt;ref&gt;This process is well analyzed by authors like Christine Messiant, Tony Hodges and others. For an eloquent illustratin, see now the Angolan magazine ''Infra-Estruturas África'' 7/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Secondary beneficiaries&quot; are the middle strata which are about to become social classes. However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live). An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatística has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as &quot;poor&quot;, according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Angola Exame'' of 12/11/2010, online http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det=16943&amp;id=2000&amp;mid=.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies.&lt;ref&gt;See Cristina Udelsmann Rodrigues, ''O Trabalho Dignifica o Homem: Estratégias de Sobrevivência em Luanda'', Lisbon: Colibri: 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident, and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda.&lt;ref&gt;As an excellent illustration see ''Luanda: A vida na cidade dos extremos'', in: ''Visão'', 11/11/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Human Development Index]] Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.&lt;ref&gt;The HDI 2010 lists Angola in the 146th position among 169 countries - one position below that of Haiti. See [http://www.undp.org/publications/hdr2010/en/HDR_2010_EN_Table1.pdf ''Human Development Index and its components.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative American [[think tank]], oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alt |first=Robert |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/africa/HL1006.CFM |title=Into Africa: China's Grab for Influence and Oil |publisher=Heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before independence in 1975, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas, coffee and sisal, but [[Angolan Civil War|three decades of civil war]] (1975–2002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from [[South Africa]] and [[Portugal]], while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Redvers, [http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123 POVERTY-ANGOLA: NGOs Sceptical of Govt's Rural Development Plans], [Inter Press Service News Agency] (June 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious structural problem of the Angolan economy are the enormous differences between the regions. This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.&lt;ref&gt;See Manuel Alves da Rocha, ''Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial'', Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigação Científica da Universidade Católica de Angola, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''The Economist '', August 16, 1975 puts the number at 500,000, but this is an estimate lacking appropriate sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages  of Angola}}
The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups plus [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] due to its being a former Portuguese colony. The indigenous languages with the largest usage are [[Umbundu]], [[Kimbundu]], and [[Kikongo]], in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.

However, in Angola the mastery of the official language is probably more extended than elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life. Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the official language is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.
#In the Portuguese “bridgeheads” [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]], which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was not only spoken by the Portuguese and their ‘’mestiço’’ descendents, but – especially in and around Luanda – by a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.
#Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its “effective occupation” in the mid 1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions. The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 1961–1974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.&lt;ref&gt;An illustration is Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, ‘’Educação e sociedade nas áreas rurais de Angola: Resultados de um inquérito’’, vol. 2, ‘’Análise do universo agrícola’’ (survey report), Serviços de Planeamento e Integração Económica de Angola, Luanda, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
#In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged. This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.

As a consequence of all this, the African “lower middle class” which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language. At the same time, the white and ‘’mestiço’’ population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.
After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, und the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest. This became a political side issue, as FNLA as well as UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.

The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, was additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered off by the Civil War. Many [[Ovimbundu]], the most populous ethnic group, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings. At the same time, a majority of the [[Bakongo]] who had fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original ‘’habitat’’, but in the cities  - and again above all in Luanda. As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous. This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban population - a trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.

The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of “Angolan Portuguese” as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil. However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant.

=== Religion ===
[[File:Angola Ethnic map 1970.svg|thumb|Ethnic groups of Angola 1970]]
{{Main|Religion in Angola}}

There are about 1000 mostly Christian religious communities in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;See Fátima Viegas, ''Panorama das Religiões em Angola Independente (1975 - 2008)'', Ministério da Cultura/Instituto Nacional para os Assuntos Religiosos, Luanda 2008&lt;/ref&gt; While reliable statistics are entirely nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are [[Roman Catholics]], while about a quarter adhere to the [[protestant]] churches introduced during the colonial period: the [[Congregationalist]]s mainly among the [[Ovimbundu]] of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West, the [[Methodists]] concentrating on the [[Kimbundu]] speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the [[Baptists]] almost exclusively among the [[Bakongo]] of the Northwest (now massively present in Luanda as well) and dispersed [[Adventists]], [[Reformed]] and [[Lutherans]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Schubert: ''Der Krieg und die Kirchen: Angola 1961 - 1991''. Exodus, Luzern/Switzerland, 1997; Lawrence W. Henderson, ''The Church in Angola: A river of many currents'', Cleveland: Pilgrim Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the &quot;syncretic&quot; Tocoists and in the Northwest a sprinkling of  [[Kimbanguism]] can be found, spreading from the Congo/Zaire. Since independence, hundreds of [[Pentecostal]] and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin. The  [[Muslims]], practically all of them immigrants from West African and other countries and belonging to the Sunnite branch, represent only about 1%; because of their diversity, they do not form a community. [[Saudi Arabia]] is at present developing an effort to enlarge their numbers, and intends to build an Islamic university in Luanda. The proportion of non-believers is significant, but impossible to be estimated. &quot;Traditional African&quot; religions exist only residually, in the main confined to some remote rural areas.

In a study assessing nations' levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0–10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_7_3.asp Angola: Religious Freedom Profile at the Association of Religion Data Archives] Brian J Grim and Roger Finke. &quot;International Religion Indexes: Government Regulation, Government Favoritism, and Social Regulation of Religion.&quot; Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion. 2 (2006) Article 1: www.religjournal.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign [[missionary|missionaries]] were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the beli
