largest island
}}

'''Achill Island''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|k|əl}}; {{lang-ga|Acaill, Oileán Acla}}) in [[County Mayo]] is the largest island off the coast of [[Ireland]], and is situated off the west coast. It has a population of 2,700. Its area is {{convert|148|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Achill is attached to the mainland by [[Michael Davitt Bridge]], between the villages of Gob an Choire ([[Achill Sound]]) and Poll Raithní ([[Polranny]]). A [[bridge]] was first completed here in 1887, and replaced by the current structure in 1949. Other centres of population include the villages of [[Keel, Achill|Keel]], [[Dooagh]], Dumha Éige ([[Dooega]]) and [[Dugort]]. The parish's main [[Gaelic football]] pitch and two [[secondary school]]s are on the mainland at Poll Raithní. Early [[human settlement]]s are believed to have been established on Achill around 3000 BCE. A paddle dating from this period was found at the [[crannóg]] near [[Dookinella]].
The island is 87% [[peat bog]]. The parish of Achill also includes the [[Curraun]] [[peninsula]]. The people of Curraun consider themselves Achill people, and most natives of Achill refer to this area as being &quot;in Achill&quot;. In the summer of 1996, the [[RNLI]] decided to station a [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] at [[Kildownet]].

==History==
It is believed that at the end of the [[Neolithic Period]] (around 4000 BCE), Achill had a population of 500–1,000 people. The island would have been mostly forest until the Neolithic people began [[agriculture|crop cultivation]]. Settlement increased during the [[Iron Age]], and the dispersal of small forts around the coast indicate the warlike nature of the times. [[Gráinne O'Malley|Granuaile]] maintained a castle at Kildownet in the 16th century.

Achill Island lies in the Barony of Burrishoole, in the territory of ancient Umhall (Umhall Uactarach and Umhall Ioctarach), that originally encompassed an area extending from the Galway/Mayo border to Achill Head in Co. Mayo.

The hereditary chieftains of Umhall were the O’Malleys, recorded in the area in 814 AD when they successfully repelled an onslaught by the Vikings in Clew Bay. The Anglo/Norman invasion of Connacht in 1235 AD saw the territory of Umhall taken over by the Butlers and later by the de Burgos. The Butler Lordship of Burrishoole continued into the late 14th century when Thomas le Botiller was recorded as being in possession of Akkyll &amp; Owyll.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, there was much migration to Achill from other parts of Ireland, particularly [[Ulster]], due to the political and religious turmoil of the time. For a while there were two different [[dialect]]s of Irish being spoken on Achill. This led to many townlands being recorded as having two names during the 1824 [[Ordnance Survey]], and some maps today give different names for the same place. Achill Irish still has many traces of [[Ulster Irish]].

===Archaeology===
[[File:Keem Strand, Achill Island - geograph.org.uk - 23186.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Keem Bay]]]]Achill Archaeological Field School is based at the Achill Archaeology Centre in Dooagh, which has served as a catalyst for a wide array of archaeological investigations on the island. It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]. Since 1991, several thousand students from 21 countries have come to Achill to study and participate in ongoing excavations. The school is involved in a study of the prehistoric and historic landscape at [[Slievemore]], incorporating a research excavation at a number of sites within the deserted village of Slievemore. Slievemore is rich in archaeological monuments that span a 5,000 year period from the [[Neolithic]] to the Post Medieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Achill Archaeological Field School 2009 | work=Achill Archaeological Field School | url=http://www.achill-fieldschool.com/ | accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent archaeological  research suggests the village was occupied year-round at least as early as the 19th century, though it is known to have served as a seasonally occupied [[booley village]] by the first half of the 20th century. (A booley village is a village occupied only during part of the year, such as a resort community, a [[lake]] community, or (as the case on Achill) a place to live while [[Transhumance|tending flocks or herds]] of [[ruminant]]s during winter or summer [[pasturing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achill247.com/pictures/slievemore-7.html ''Deserted village, Slievemore, Achill Island'', achill247.com] Retrieved on 2008-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, some of the people of Dooagh and [[Pollagh, Achill|Pollagh]] would migrate in the summer to Slievemore and then go back to Dooagh in the autumn.

From 2004 to 2006, the Achill Island Maritime Archaeology Project was sponsored by the [[College of William and Mary]], the [[Institute of Maritime History]], the Achill Folklife Centre, and the [[St. Augustine Light|Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)]]. This project focused on the documentation of archaeological resources related to Achill's rich maritime heritage.  Maritime archaeologists recorded 19th century fishing station, ice house, and boat house ruins, a number of anchors which had been salvaged from the sea, 19th century and more recent [[currach]] pens, a number of traditional vernacular watercraft including a possibly 100-year old Achill yawl, and the remains of four historic shipwrecks.  The summer 2009 field school excavated Round House 2 on Slievemore Mountain under the direction of archaeologist Stuart Rathbone.  Only the outside northwall, entrance way and inside of the Round House were completely excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Burt, member of Achill Field School, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of interest==
Despite some unsympathetic development, the island retains some striking natural beauty. The cliffs of [[Croaghaun]] on the western end of the island are the third highest sea [[cliff]]s in [[Europe]] but are inaccessible by road. Near the westernmost point of Achill, [[Achill Head]], is [[Keem Bay]]. [[Keel Beach]] is quite popular with [[tourist]]s and some locals as a [[surfing]] location. South of Keem beach is [[Moytoge Head]], which with its rounded appearance drops dramatically down to the [[ocean]]. An old [[United Kingdom|British]] observation post, built during [[World War I]] to prevent the [[Germany|Germans]] from landing arms for the [[Irish Republican Army]], is still standing on Moytoge. During the Second World War this post was rebuilt by the Irish Defence Forces as a Look Out Post for the Coast Watching Service wing of the Defence Forces. It operated from 1939 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;See Michael Kennedy, 'Guarding Neutral Ireland' (Dublin, 2008), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Slievemore.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Slievemore]] mountain dominates the centre of the island]]

The [[mountain]] [[Slievemore]] (672&amp;nbsp;m) rises dramatically in the north of the island and the [[Atlantic Drive]] (along the south/west of the island) has some dramatically beautiful views. On the slopes of Slievemore, there is an [[abandoned village]] (the &quot;Deserted Village&quot;) The Deserted Village is traditionally thought to be a remnant village from An Gorta Mór ([[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|The Great Hunger of 1845-1849]]).

Just west of the deserted village is an old [[Martello tower]], again built by the British to warn of any possible [[France|French]] invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The area also boasts an approximately 5000-year old [[Neolithic tomb]]. [[Achillbeg]] (''{{lang|ga|Acaill Beag}}'', ''Little Achill'') is a small island just off Achill's southern tip. Its inhabitants were resettled on Achill in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Beaumont (2005), ''Achillbeg: The Life of an Island'', ISBN 0-85361-631-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The villages of [[Dooniver]] and [[Askill]] have very picturesque scenery and the cycle route is popular with Tourists.

==Economy==
While a number of attempts at setting up small industrial units on the island have been made, the economy of the island is largely dependent on [[tourism]]. Subventions from Achill people working abroad, in particular in the [[United Kingdom]]  the [[United States]] and Africa allowed many families to remain living in Achill throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Since the advent of Ireland's &quot;[[Celtic Tiger]]&quot; [[economy of Ireland|economy]] fewer Achill people were forced to look for work abroad. [[Agriculture]] plays a small role and the fact that the island is mostly bog means that its potential for agriculture is limited largely to [[sheep farming]]. In the past, [[fishing]] was a significant activity but this aspect of the economy is small now. At one stage, the island was known for its [[shark]] fishing, [[basking shark]] in particular was fished for its valuable [[liver oil]]. There was a big spurt of growth in tourism in the 1960s and 1970s before which life was tough and difficult on the island. Despite healthy visitor numbers each year, the common perception is that tourism in Achill has been slowly declining since its heyday. Currently the largest employers on Achill are two hotels and a call centre. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.irelandbyways.com/top-irish-peninsulas/the-west/the-western-isles/achill-island-co-mayo/&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009 Ireland's only [[Turbot]] farm opened in the [[Bunnacurry]] Business Park.

==Religion==
Most people on Achill are either [[Roman Catholic]] or [[Church of Ireland]]. There are three priests on Achill and eight [[church (building)|churches]] in total.

As a popular tourist destination Achill has many bars, cafes and restaurants which serve a full range of food. However with the islands [[Atlantic]] location seafood is a speciality on Achill with common foods including [[salmon]], [[Homarus gammarus|lobster]], [[mussels]] and [[trout]]. With a large sheep population, Achill lamb is a very popular meal on the island too. Furthermore Achill has a big population of cows which produces excellent beef.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Achill island offers one of the most perfect locations for outdoor adventure activities in Europe from surfing and [http://www.puremagic.ie/puremagic-achill-lodge-kitecentre kitesurfing] on keel beach to sea kayaking on the north shore. the main outdoor center located on the island is [http://www.achilloutdoor.com/ Achill Outdoor Education Centre]

==Population==
In 2006, the population was 2,701. The island's population has declined from around 6,000 before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Hunger]].

==Architecture==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2009}}
Because of the inhospitable climate, few inhabited houses date from before the 20th century, though there are many examples of abandoned stone structures dating to the 19th century.
[[File:Achill Slievemore Deserted Village.jpg|250px|thumb|The &quot;Deserted Village&quot; at the foot of Slievemore was a [[Booley village]]; see [[Transhumance]]]]
[[File:Deserted Village in the Shadow of Slievemore.JPG|250px|thumb|The location of the village is relatively sheltered]]
The best known of these earlier can be seen in the &quot;Deserted Village&quot; ruins near the graveyard at the foot of Slievemore. Even the houses in this village represent a relatively comfortable class of dwelling as, even as recently as a hundred years ago, some people still used &quot;Beehive&quot; style houses (small circular single roomed dwellings with a hole in ceiling to let out smoke).

Many of the oldest and most picturesque inhabited cottages date from the activities of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]]—a body set up around the turn of the 20th century in Ireland to improve the welfare for inhabitants of small villages and towns. Most of the homes in Achill at the time were very small and tightly packed together in villages. The CDB subsidised the building of new, more spacious (though still small by modern standards) homes outside of the traditional villages.

Some of the recent building development on the island (over the last 30 years or so) has been contentious and in many cases is not as sympathetic to the landscape as the earlier style of [[whitewash]]ed raised gable [[cottage]]s. Because of generous tax incentives, many holiday homes have been built over the last ten years. This building boom has brought benefits but at a cost. On the one hand it has provided much-needed employment for the local people, has increased the demand and value for suitable development land and has allows the island to support more tourists. On the other hand, many of these houses have been built in prominent scenic areas and have damaged traditional views of the island while lying empty for most of the year. They may also be contributing to the declining fortunes for the traditional beneficiaries of tourism - [[bed and breakfast]]s, [[public house]]s and guesthouses.

==Notable people==
[[File:Acaill Abú.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Achill [[Gaelic football|football]] team celebrate winning the Junior [[County Mayo|county]] title, [[Castlebar]], 21 October 2007]]
* [[Manus Sweeney]] from Achill was hanged by the British in [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]] for his part in the [[1798 rebellion]]. There is a monument to him at the eastern end of Keel beach.
* The artist [[Paul Henry (painter)|Paul Henry]] stayed on the island for a number of years in the early 1900s and some of his most famous paintings are of the dramatic landscape of the island. Not long after arriving, he threw his return train ticket into the sea near [[Purteen Harbour]].
* The [[Nobel Prize]] winning author, [[Heinrich Böll]], visited the island and wrote of his experience in his &quot;Irish Journal&quot; (''Irisches Tagebuch''). The Bölls later bought a cottage near Dugort and lived in it periodically until 2001 when they donated it to be used as an artists' residence.
* Novelist [[Graham Greene]], visited and stayed on Achill Island a number of times in the late 1940s. He wrote parts of the novels ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' (subsequently banned in Ireland) and ''The Fallen Idol'' in Dooagh, and Achill Island is also said to have inspired Greene to write some of his best poetry. He retained a special affection for Achill Island, which he mentioned frequently in his letters and notes, although this was largely due to the circumstances of his visits, as he was introduced to Achill by his mistress, [[Catherine Walston]]. She rented a cottage in Dooagh, with no electricity, one outside tap for water, and a corrugated iron roof on the traditional stone cottage, now since demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Graham Greene &amp; Achill Island | work=Achill 24/7 | url=http://www.achill247.com/writers/ggreene.html | accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Artist [[Robert Henri]] came to Achill on a regular basis in the early decades of the 20th century. He painted a famous portrait of Johnny and Biddy Commins in Dooagh in 1913, entitled 'Himself and Herself'. This painting is now regarded as a master-piece and reproductions are in big demand in America. The painting won the coveted Beck Gold Medal Award. It was during his early trips to Achill prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]] that Henri painted extensively and is reputed to have done portraits of almost all the children in Dooagh village. He bought Corrymore House on the hill above Dooagh in 1924. He died in America in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Their portraits are famous in America but - Whatever happened to the Commins family of Achill? | work=Western People - 1 April 1998| url=http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/1998/04/01/News.htm | accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irwin Allen Ginsberg''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|n|z|b|ər|ɡ}}; June 3, 1926 – April 5, 1997) was an American poet who vigorously opposed [[militarism]], [[materialism]] and [[sexual repression]]. In the 1950s, Ginsberg was a leading figure of the [[Beat Generation]]. Ginsberg's epic poem &quot;[[Howl]]&quot;, in which he celebrates his fellow &quot;angel-headed hipsters&quot; and excoriates what he saw as the destructive forces of [[capitalism]] and [[conformity]] in the United States, is one of the classic poems of the Beat Generation.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen. (2000) ''Deliberate Prose: Selected Essays 1952–1995''. Foreword by Edward Sanders. New York: HarperCollinsPublishers, pp.xx-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, dedicated to writer [[Carl Solomon]], has the opening:

''I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by''&lt;br/&gt;
''madness, starving hysterical naked,''&lt;br/&gt;
''dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn''&lt;br/&gt;
''looking for an angry fix...''&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen. (1956) ''Howl And Other Poems''. San Francisco: City Lights Books, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1955, Ginsberg and five other unknown poets gave a [[Six Gallery reading|free reading]] at an experimental art gallery in [[San Francisco]]. Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; electrified the audience. According to fellow poet [[Michael McClure]], it was clear &quot;that a barrier had been broken, that a human voice and body had been hurled against the harsh wall of America and its supporting armies and navies and academies and institutions and ownership systems and power support bases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;de Grazia, pp.330–331.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, &quot;Howl&quot; attracted widespread publicity when it became the subject of an obscenity trial in which a San Francisco prosecutor argued it contained &quot;filthy, vulgar, obscene, and disgusting language.&quot; The poem seemed especially outrageous in 1950s America because it depicted both [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] sex&lt;ref&gt;see Ginsberg, &quot;Howl&quot; pp.13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] made homosexual acts a crime in every U.S. state. &quot;Howl&quot; reflected Ginsberg's own homosexuality and his relationships with a number of men, including [[Peter Orlovsky]], his lifelong partner.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Jane. (1968) ''Allen Ginsberg in America''. New York: Random House, pp.43–46 on Ginsberg's first meeting with Orlovsky and the conditions of their &quot;marriage.&quot; Also see, Miles, Barry. (1989) ''Ginsberg: A Biography''. New York: Simon and Schuster, pp. 178–179 on Ginsberg's description of sex with Orlovsky as &quot;one of the first times that I felt open with a boy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Clayton W. Horn]] ruled that &quot;Howl&quot; was not obscene, adding, &quot;Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;de Grazia, p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Howl&quot; and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the [[epic poetry|epic]], [[free verse]] style of the 19th century American poet [[Walt Whitman]]. Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence.&lt;ref&gt;see Ginsberg, (''Deliberate Prose''), pp. 285–331.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. D. McClatchy]], editor of the ''[[Yale Review]]'' called Ginsberg &quot;the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.&quot; McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, &quot;was a bard in the old manner – outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era's psyche, with all its contradictory urges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Willborn. ''Allen Ginsberg, Master Poet Of Beat Generation, Dies at 70'', ''New York Times'', April 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginsberg was a practicing [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who studied Eastern religious disciplines extensively. One of his most influential teachers was the Tibetan Buddhist, the Venerable [[Chögyam Trungpa]], founder of the Naropa Institute, now [[Naropa University]] at [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry Miles. ''Ginsberg: A Biography''. London: Virgin Publishing Ltd. (2001), paperback, 628 pages, ISBN 0-7535-0486-3, pp.440–444.&lt;/ref&gt; At Trungpa's urging, Ginsberg and poet [[Anne Waldman]] started a poetry school there in 1974 which they called the &quot;[[Jack Kerouac School|Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp.454–455&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his attraction to Eastern religions, the journalist [[Jane Kramer]] argues that Ginsberg, like Whitman, adhered to an &quot;American brand of mysticism&quot; that was, in her words, &quot;rooted in humanism and in a romantic and visionary ideal of harmony among men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg's political activism was consistent with his religious beliefs. He took part in decades of non-violent political protest against everything from the [[Vietnam War]] to the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;see Ginsberg, (''Deliberate Prose''), from the foreword by Edward Sanders, p.xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary critic, [[Helen Vendler]], described Ginsberg as &quot;tirelessly persistent in protesting censorship, imperial politics, and persecution of the powerless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vendler, Helen. ''Books: A Lifelong Poem Including History'', ''The New Yorker'', January 13, 1986, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements as a writer as well as his notoriety as an activist gained him honors from established institutions. Ginsberg's book of poems, ''The Fall of America'', won the [[National Book Award]] for poetry in 1974. Other honors included the [[National Arts Club]] gold medal and his induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]], both in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.484.&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg was a [[Pulitzer Prize]] finalist in 1995 for his book, ''Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems 1986–1992''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Poetry |title=The Pulitzer Prizes &amp;#124; Poetry |publisher=Pulitzer.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Ginsberg was born into a [[Jew]]ish&lt;ref&gt;Pacernick, Gary. &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3692/is_199707/ai_n8771729/pg_6 Allen Ginsberg: An interview by Gary Pacernick]&quot; (February 10, 1996), [[The American Poetry Review]], Jul/Aug 1997. &quot;Yeah, I am a Jewish poet. I'm Jewish.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; family in [[Newark, New Jersey]], and grew up in nearby [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]].

As a young teenager, Ginsberg began to write letters to ''The New York Times'' about political issues, such as [[World War II]] and workers' rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioProject&quot; /&gt;  While in high school, Ginsberg began reading Walt Whitman, inspired by his teacher's passionate reading.&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;Miles, Barry. Ginsberg: A Biography. London: Virgin Publishing Ltd. (2001), paperback, 628 pages, ISBN 0-7535-0486-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Ginsberg graduated from [[Eastside High School (Paterson, New Jersey)|Eastside High School]] and briefly attended [[Montclair State College]] before entering [[Columbia University]] on a scholarship from the [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]] of Paterson.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; In 1945, he joined the Merchant Marine to earn money to continue his education at Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Ginsberg, ''The Letters of Allen Ginsberg'' (Philadelphia, Da Capo Press, 2008) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; While at Columbia, Ginsberg contributed to the ''Columbia Review'' literary journal, the ''[[Jester of Columbia|Jester]]'' humor magazine, won the Woodberry Poetry Prize and served as president of the [[Philolexian Society]], the campus literary and debate group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

===Relationship with his parents===
His father Louis Ginsberg was a poet and a high school teacher.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news |first=Wilborn  |last=Hampton |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Allen Ginsberg, Master Poet Of Beat Generation, Dies at 70 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE6D7143CF935A35757C0A961958260 |quote=Allen Ginsberg was born on June 3, 1926, in Newark and grew up in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the second son of Louis Ginsberg, a schoolteacher and sometime poet, and the former Naomi Levy, a Russian emigree and fervent Marxist. |publisher=New York Times |date=April 6, 1997 |accessdate=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg's mother, Naomi Livergant Ginsberg, was affected by a rare psychological illness that was never properly diagnosed.&lt;ref name=Modern&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/ginsberg/life.htm| title=Allen Ginsberg's Life| first=Ann| last=Charters| publisher=Modern American Poetry website| accessdate=2005-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an active member of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and took Ginsberg and his brother Eugene to party meetings.

ISBN 0-472-06353-7, 9780472063536. pg. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suspicion of those around her caused Naomi to draw closer to young Allen, &quot;her little pet,&quot; as Bill Morgan says in his biography of Ginsberg, entitled, ''I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg''.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Morgan. ''I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg''. Penguin, 2006.

Dittman. ''Masterpieces of Beat literature''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007.

Ed. David M. Galens. Vol. 47. Detroit: Gale, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was in junior high school, he accompanied his mother by bus to her therapist. The trip deeply disturbed Ginsberg — he mentioned it and other moments from his childhood in &quot;Kaddish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern&quot; /&gt;  His experiences with his mother's mental illness and her institutionalization are also frequently referred to in &quot;Howl&quot;. For example, &quot;Pilgrim State, Rockland, and Grey Stone's foetid halls&quot; is a reference to institutions frequented by his mother and Carl Solomon, ostensibly the subject of the poem: Pilgrim State Hospital and Rockland State Hospital in New York and Greystone State Hospital in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name = Morgan13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen Ginsberg.

ISBN 0-7867-1099-3. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  This is followed soon by the line &quot;with mother finally ******.&quot; Ginsberg later admitted the deletion was the expletive &quot;fucked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Original Draft'' pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says of Solomon in section three, &quot;I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother,&quot; once again showing the association between Solomon and his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Raskin, ''American Scream: Allen Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; and the Making of the Beat Generation'', pg. 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi died in 1956, and she did not have a [[kaddish]] at her funeral because there were not ten Jewish men present. Ginsberg tried to have one performed for her, but was unable to since the two companions with him, Jack Kerouac and Peter Orlovsky, were not Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pg. 203-204&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg received a letter from his mother, responding to a copy of &quot;Howl&quot; he had sent her, after Naomi had died. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, &quot;The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window -- I have the key -- Get married Allen don't take drugs -- the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, pg. 426-427.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg's brother Eugene, she said, &quot;God's informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key on the side of the window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Celebrate'', pg. 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt;  These letters and the inability to perform the kaddish ceremony inspired Ginsberg to write &quot;Kaddish&quot; which makes references to many details from Naomi's life, Ginsberg's experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines &quot;the key is in the light&quot; and &quot;the key is in the window&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Ginsberg. ''Kaddish and Other Poems''.Volume 2, Issue 14 of The pocket poets series. City Lights Books, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Beats===
In Ginsberg's freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate [[Lucien Carr]], who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including [[Jack Kerouac]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[John Clellon Holmes]]. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of post–World War II, McCarthy-era America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raskin&quot;/&gt; Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a &quot;New Vision&quot; (a phrase adapted from [[Arthur Rimbaud]]) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to [[Neal Cassady]], for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Gifford, ed., ''As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg &amp; Neal Cassady''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac later described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady in the first chapter of his 1957 novel ''[[On the Road]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern&quot; /&gt; Kerouac saw them  as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their &quot;New Vision.&quot; Kerouac's perception had to do partly with Ginsberg's association with Communism. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him &quot;[[Carlo Marx]]&quot; in ''On the Road''. This was a source of strain in their relationship, since Kerouac grew increasingly distrustful of Communism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

In 1948 in an apartment in [[Harlem]], Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of [[William Blake]] (later referred to as his &quot;Blake vision&quot;). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading ''[[Ah, Sunflower]]'', ''[[The Sick Rose]]'', and ''Little Girl Lost''. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the [[fire escape]] and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

Also, in New York, Ginsberg met [[Gregory Corso]] in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso's poems, realizing Corso was &quot;spiritually gifted.&quot; Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him, and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg's girlfriend from one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg was living with the woman and took Corso over to their apartment, where the woman proposed sex while Corso was very young. He fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained life-long friends and collaborators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after this period in Ginsberg's life, he became romantically involved with [[Elise Cowen|Elise Nada Cowen]] after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College that she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generations period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met [[Joyce Johnson]] and Leo Skir, among other Beat players.  As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona.  While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname &quot;Beat Alice&quot; as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in one of her books ''Come and Join the Dance'', which expressed the two women's experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem &quot;Howl&quot;. This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg prior to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.

===San Francisco Renaissance===

In 1954, in [[San Francisco]], Ginsberg met [[Peter Orlovsky]] (1933–2010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his life-long partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:AcidTest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Acid Tests|Acid Test]] poster with Allen Ginsberg.]]

Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg's mentor [[William Carlos Williams]] wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and [[Zen]] enthusiasts who were friends at [[Reed College]]: [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]], and [[Lew Welch]]. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, [[Bob Kaufman]], [[A. D. Winans]], and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the ''Beatitude'' poetry magazine.  

[[Wally Hedrick]] — a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery — approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of &quot;Howl&quot;, he changed his &quot;fucking mind&quot;, as he put it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raskin&quot; /&gt; Ginsberg advertised the event as &quot;Six Poets at the Six Gallery&quot;. One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as &quot;The [[Six Gallery reading]]&quot; took place on October 7, 1955.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4950578| title= Birth of the Beat Generation: 50 Years of ''Howl''| first=Robert | last=Siegel| accessdate=2006-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg: that night was the first public reading of &quot;Howl&quot;, a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in [[Kerouac]]'s novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched. A taped recording of the reading of &quot;Howl&quot; that Ginsberg gave at [[Reed College]] was rediscovered and appeared on their multimedia website from 9am PST 15 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/news_center/multimedia/2007-08/howl_unedited1.28.08.html |title=Reed College &amp;#124; News Center &amp;#124; Howl: Unedited |publisher=Web.reed.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginsberg's principal work, &quot;Howl&quot;, is well-known for its opening line: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....&quot; &quot;Howl&quot; was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco's [[City Lights Bookstore]], it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a [[cause célèbre]] among defenders of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

====Biographical references in &quot;Howl&quot;====
Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac's ''Duluoz Legend''). &quot;Howl&quot; is not only a biography of Ginsberg's experiences before 1955, but also a history of the [[Beat Generation]]. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of &quot;Howl&quot; were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though &quot;Kaddish&quot; deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), &quot;Howl&quot; in many ways is driven by the same emotions. &quot;Howl&quot; chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsberg’s life.  He begins the poem with “I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness”, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature.&lt;ref name=Raskin /&gt; This madness was the “angry fix” that society needed to function—madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on “Carl Solomon! I’m with you in Rockland”, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his “straightjacket”. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, &quot;Howl&quot;, his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.

===To Paris and the &quot;Beat Hotel&quot;===
In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in [[Morocco]], he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue Gît-le-Coeur that was to become known as the [[Beat Hotel]]. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem &quot;Kaddish&quot;, Corso composed ''Bomb'' and ''Marriage'', and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together ''[[Naked Lunch]],'' from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer [[Harold Chapman]], who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the &quot;hotel&quot; until it closed in 1963. During 1962–3, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in [[Benaras]] and [[Calcutta]]. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poets of the time including [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]] and [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]]. He lived with the current President of India [[Pratibha Patil]] in Varanasi in 1962. Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably [[Pupul Jayakar]] who helped him escape imprisonment during the [[Sino-Indian War]].

===England and the  International Poetry Incarnation===

In May, 1965, Allen Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;Nuttall, J: ''Bomb Culture'' MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1968 ISBN 0-261-62617-5&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at [[Better Books]], which was described by [[Jeff Nuttall]] as &quot;''the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;/&gt; [[Tom McGrath (playwright)|Tom McGrath]] wrote &quot;''This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England – or at least in the history of English Poetry''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-2&quot;&gt;Fountain, N: ''Underground: the London alternative press, 1966–74'' page 16. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988 ISBN 0-415-00728-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the [[International Poetry Incarnation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-2&quot;/&gt; which was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London on June 11, 1965. The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, [[Adrian Mitchell]], [[Alexander Trocchi]], [[Harry Fainlight]], [[Anselm Hollo]], [[Christopher Logue]], [[George Macbeth]], [[Gregory Corso]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]],  [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Simon Vinkenoog]], [[Spike Hawkins]] and [[Tom McGrath (playwright)|Tom McGrath]].

[[Peter Lorrimer Whitehead|Peter Whitehead]] documented the event on film and released it as ''[[Wholly Communion]]''. A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.

===Continuing literary activity===
[[Image:Allen Ginsberg und Peter Orlowski ArM.jpg|thumb|250px|Ginsberg with his forty-year partner, poet [[Peter Orlovsky]]. Photo taken in 1978]]
Though the term &quot;Beat&quot; is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term &quot;Beat Generation&quot; has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name &quot;Beat Generation.&quot; Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: [[David Amram]], [[Bob Kaufman]]; LeRoi Jones before he became [[Amiri Baraka]], who, after reading &quot;Howl&quot;, wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper; [[Diane DiPrima]]; [[Jim Cohn]]; poets associated with the [[Black Mountain College]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Denise Levertov]]; poets associated with the [[New York School]] such as [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Kenneth Koch]].
[[Image:Ginsberg-dylan.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait with [[Bob Dylan]], taken in 1975]]
Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the beat movement of the 1950s and the [[hippies]] of the 1960s, befriending, among others, [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ken Kesey]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. Ginsberg gave his last public reading at [[Booksmith]], a bookstore in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, a few months before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fora.tv/2008/10/23/Bill_Morgan_The_Letters_of_Allen_Ginsberg Video of Ginsberg biographer Bill Morgan speaking about the poet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Krishnaism===
{{See also|Bhaktivedanta Swami|Mantra-Rock Dance}}
Ginsberg's spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to India and a chance encounter on a New York City street with [[Chögyam Trungpa]] [[Rinpoche]] (they both tried to catch the same cab), a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] meditation master of the Kagyu and Nyingma sects, who became his friend and life-long teacher. Ginsberg helped Trungpa (and New York poet Anne Waldman) in founding the [[Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]] at [[Naropa University]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatdom.com/pages/archives/issue1.html#buddhism &quot;The Beats and Travel&quot; by David S. Wills]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginsberg was also involved with [[Krishnaism]]. He befriended [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], the founder of the [[Hare Krishna]] movement in the Western world, a relationship that is documented by [[Satsvarupa Das Goswami]] in his biographical account ''Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta''. Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and toured with him to promote his cause.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.beatdom.com/buddhism_and_the_beats.htm Wills, D., Buddhism and the Beats', in Wills, D. (ed.) Beatdom Vol. 1 (Mauling Press: Dundee, 2007) p. 9-13]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prabhupada's arrival in San Francisco 1967.jpg|thumb|left|Allen Ginsberg greeting [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]] at the [[San Francisco Airport]]. January 17, 1967]]Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness#Four regulative principles|required prohibitions]], Ginsberg often sang the [[Hare Krishna mantra]] publicly as part of his philosophy&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks 1992 78–9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1992|pp=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared that it brought a state of ecstacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Szatmary|1996|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic [[swami]] from [[India]], was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Alan Watts]], Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks 1992 78–9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginsberg|1986|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;(from the &quot;Houseboat Summit&quot; panel discussion, [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito CA]]. February 1967)({{Harvnb|Cohen|1991|p=182}}):&lt;br /&gt;
Ginsberg: So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?&lt;br /&gt;
[[Gary Snyder|Snyder]]: Why, it's a lovely positive thing to say Krishna. It's a beautiful mythology and it's a beautiful practice.&lt;br /&gt;
Leary: Should be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
Ginsberg: He feels it's the one uniting thing. He feels a monopolistic unitary thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Alan Watts|Watts]]: I'll tell yo why I think he feels it. The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association. ... [W]hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn't got any of [horrible] associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, and we can get with that, you see, and we can dig that!&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 1967 Allen Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at the [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco Airport]], where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muster|1997|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Addressing speculations that he was Allen Ginsberg's guru, Bhaktivedanta Swami answered a direct question in a public program, &quot;Are you Allen Ginsberg's guru?&quot; by saying, &quot;I am nobody’s guru. I am everybody’s servant. Actually I am not even a servant; a servant of God is no ordinary thing.&quot; ({{Harvnb|Greene|2007|p=85}}; {{Harvnb|Goswami|2011|pp=196–7}})&lt;/ref&gt; To further support and promote Bhaktivendata Swami's message and chanting in San Francisco, Allen Ginsberg agreed to attend the [[Mantra-Rock Dance]]—a musical event held at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] by the San Francisco [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] temple. It featured some leading rock bands of the time: [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] with [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Grateful Dead]], and [[Moby Grape]], who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]] and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the [[Hare Krishna mantra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromley|Shinn|1989 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chryssides|Wilkins|2006|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joplin|1992 |p =182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967 Mantra-Rock Dance Avalon poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Mantra-Rock Dance]] promotional poster featuring Allen Ginsberg along with leading rock bands.]]Music and chanting were both important parts of Ginsberg's live delivery during poetry readings.&lt;ref&gt;Chowka, Peter Barry, &quot;[http://members.aol.com/pbchowka/ginsberg76a.html This is Allen Ginsberg?]&quot; (Interview), [[New Age Journal]], April 1976.  &quot;I had known [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Bhaktivedanta]] and was somewhat guided by him... spiritual friend.  I practiced the Hare Krishna chant, practiced it with him, sometimes in mass auditoriums and parks in the Lower East Side of New York.  Actually, I'd been chanting it since '63, after coming back from India. I began chanting it, in Vancouver at a great poetry conference, for the first time in '63, with Duncan and Olson and everybody around, and then continued. When Bhaktivedanta arrived on the Lower East Side in '66 it was reinforcement for me, like 'the reinforcements had arrived' from India.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  He often accompanied himself on a [[Harmonium#India|harmonium]], and was often accompanied by a guitarist.  When Ginsberg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Lord [[Krishna]] on [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s TV show ''[[Firing Line]]'' on September 3, 1968, Buckley acceded and the poet chanted slowly as he played dolefully on a harmonium.  According to [[Richard Brookhiser]], an associate of Buckley's, the host commented that it was &quot;the most unharried Krishna I've ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Konigsberg, Eric, &quot;Buckley's Urbane Debating Club: ''Firing Line'' Set a Standard For Political Discourse on TV&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', Metro Section, p B1, February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen further brought mantras into the world of rock and roll when he recited the [[Heart Sutra]] in the song [[Ghetto Defendant]].  The song appears on the 1982 album [[Combat Rock]] by British first wave punk band [[The Clash]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Attendance to his poetry readings was generally [[standing room only]] for most of his career, no matter where in the world he appeared.  Ginsberg came in touch with the [[Hungry generation|Hungryalist]] poets of [[Bengal]], especially [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], who introduced Ginsberg to the three fishes with one head of Indian emperor [[Akbar the Great|Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar]]. The three fishes symbolised coexistence of all thought, philosophy and religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewastepaper.blogspot.com the wastepaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
Ginsberg won the [[National Book Award]] for his book [[The Fall of America: Poems of These States|''The Fall of America'']]. In 1993, the French Minister of Culture awarded him the medal of ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]]'' (the Knight of Arts and Letters).

With the exception of a special guest appearance at the [[NYU]] Poetry Slam on February 20, 1997, Ginsberg gave what is thought to be his last reading at The [[Booksmith]] in San Francisco on December 16, 1996. He died April 5, 1997, surrounded by family and friends in his [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] loft in New York City, succumbing to [[liver cancer]] via complications of [[hepatitis]]. He was 70 years old.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Ginsberg continued to write through his final illness, with his last poem, &quot;Things I'll Not Do (Nostalgias)&quot;, written on March 30.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Ginsberg, ''Collected Poems 1947–1997'', p.1160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political activism==
===Free speech===
Ginsberg's willingness to talk about taboo subjects made him a controversial figure during the conservative 1950s, and a significant figure in the 1960s. In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing &quot;Howl&quot;.  At the time, such “sex talk” employed in &quot;Howl&quot; was considered a form of vulgar pornography, and could even be prosecuted under law.&lt;ref name=Raskin&gt;Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California UP. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg used phrases such as “cocksucker”, “fucked in the ass”, and “cunt” to show the underbelly of America. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including ''[[Lady Chatterley’s Lover]]''.&lt;ref name=Raskin /&gt; The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the conventional sex between married couples, or even long time lovers.  Instead, Ginsberg promotes casual sex, and used this to echo the emptiness and constant hunger in the lives of Americans.&lt;ref name=Raskin /&gt;  For example, in &quot;Howl&quot;, Ginsberg praises the man “who sweetened the snatches of a million girls”.  Ginsberg displayed the true hunger of humanity through gritty obscenities and frank talk about sex, pointing out the man “who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup”; Ginsberg used such taboo language, not only to promote free speech, but also to mirror the depravity of the human condition at the time. Ginsberg also went a step further, discussing the taboo topic of homosexuality.  The obscenity that filled &quot;Howl&quot; eventually led to an important trial on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issues.  Ginsberg’s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried &quot;redeeming social importance&quot;,&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;Ed. Bill Morgan. ''Howl'' on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression. California: City of Lights. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; thus setting an important legal precedent. Even so, Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to [[Herbert Huncke]]: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.&lt;ref name=Deliberate&gt;Ginsberg, Allen. Deliberate Prose: Selected Essays 1952–1995. Harper Perennial, 2001. ISBN 0-06-093081-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in Vietnam War protests===
Ginsberg also played a key role in ensuring that a 1965 protest of the [[Vietnam war]], which took place at the Oakland-Berkeley city line and drew several thousand marchers, was not violently interrupted by the California chapter of the notorious motorcycle gang, the [[Hells Angels]], and their leader, [[Sonny Barger]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The day prior to the scheduled march, the [[Hells Angels|Hell's Angels]] attacked the front line of a smaller scale protest, where a confrontation between police and demonstrators was brewing. The Hell's Angels came in on motorcycles and slashed banners while yelling &quot;Go back to Russia, you fucking communists!&quot; at the protesters. The Hell's Angels then vowed to disrupt the larger protest the next day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Ginsberg travelled to Barger's home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to talk the situation through. It is rumored that he offered Barger and other members of the Hell's Angels [[LSD]] as a gesture of friendship and goodwill.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  In the end, Barger and the other Hell's Angels that were present came away deeply impressed by the courage of Ginsberg and his companion [[Ken Kesey]]. They vowed not to attack the next day's protest march, and, furthermore, deemed Ginsberg a man who was worth helping out.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In 1968, Ginsberg signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;“Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was present the night of the massive [[Tompkins Square Park Police Riot]] in 1988 and provided an eyewitness account to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0711FC3A540C778DDDA10894D0484D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fP%2fParks%20and%20Other%20Recreation%20Areas &quot;Melee in Tompkins Sq. Park: Violence and Its Provocation,&quot;] by Todd Purdham, ''The New York Times'', August 14, 1988, Section 1; Part 1, Page 1, Column 4; Metropolitan Desk&lt;/ref&gt;
It was shortly after the Tompkins Square Park riots in New York that Ginsberg was involved in a fracas with the [[Mentofreeist]] group and was assaulted by its leader, Vargus Pike. Pike was arrested, and was later released when Ginsberg, sporting a black eye, refused to press charges.

===Relationship to Communism===
Ginsberg talked openly about his connections with [[Communism]] and his admiration for past communist heroes and the labor movement at a time when the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] and [[McCarthyism]] were still raging. He admired Castro and many other quasi-Marxist figures from the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=Q2HroA5QrAwC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=ginsberg+castro#v=onepage&amp;q=ginsberg%20castro&amp;f=false| title=Family Business: Selected Letters Between a Father and Son| editor=Michael Schumacher| publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing| year= 2002| isbn=978-1-58234-216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-13/ginsberg1.html |title=ALLEN GINSBERG (8/11/96) |publisher=Gwu.edu |date=1965-04-26 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[America (poem)|America]]&quot; (1956), Ginsberg writes: &quot;America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry....&quot; Biographer Jonah Raskin has claimed that, despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy, Ginsberg held &quot;his own [[idiosyncratic]] version of communism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, 170&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, when Donald Mains, a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the Communist Party, Ginsberg objected: &quot;I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the [[Communist party]], nor am I dedicated to the [[Coup|overthrow]] of [the U.S.] government or any government by violence. ... I must say that I see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capitalist that I have observed ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg ''The Letters of Allen Ginsberg'' (Philadelphia, Da Capo Press, 2008) p.359. For context, see also Bill Morgan, ''I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg'', pp. 474–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginsberg travelled to several Communist countries to promote free speech. He claimed that Communist countries, such as China, welcomed him because they thought he was an enemy of [[Capitalism]], but often turned against him when they saw him as a trouble maker. For example, in 1965 Ginsberg was deported from [[Cuba]] for publicly protesting persecution of homosexuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;english.illinois.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/ginsberg/life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubans sent him to [[Czechoslovakia]], where one week after being named the ''Král majálesu'' (&quot;King of [[Majáles]]&quot; &amp;ndash; students' festivity, celebration of the [[spring (season)|spring]] and student life), Ginsberg was labelled an &quot;immoral menace&quot; by the Czechoslovak government because of his free expression of radical ideas, and was then deported on May 7, 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;english.illinois.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.furious.com/perfect/pulnoc.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Václav Havel]] points to Ginsberg as an important inspiration in striving for freedom.{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=bM74g8M-SeQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT200&amp;lpg=RA1-PT200&amp;dq=V%C3%A1clav+Havel+ginsberg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Spontaneous Mind: Selected Interviews 1958-1996| editor=David Carter| publisher=HarperCollins| year= 2002| isbn= 978-0-06-093082-0 }}

===Gay rights===
One contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about [[homosexuality]]. Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people. In 1943, he discovered within himself &quot;mountains of homosexuality.&quot; He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry. He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his [[Who's Who]] entry. Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;

In writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent, he challenged—and ultimately changed—obscenity laws. He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws (William S. Burroughs and [[Lenny Bruce]], for example).

===Association with NAMBLA===
Ginsberg also spoke out in defense of the freedom of expression of the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA).&lt;ref name=&quot;PedIJN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijn.com/archive/2002+arch/062102.htm#story8|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061018211729/http://www.ijn.com/archive/2002+arch/062102.htm#story8|archivedate=2006-10-18| title=Allen Ginsberg's advocacy of pedophilia debated in community.| first=Andrea | last=Jacobs| year=2002| publisher=Intermountain Jewish News|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Thoughts on NAMBLA&quot;, a 1994 essay published in the collection ''[[Deliberate Prose]]'', Ginsberg stated, &quot;I joined NAMBLA in defense of free speech.&quot; In the essay, he referred to NAMBLA &quot;as a forum for reform of those laws on youthful sexuality which members deem oppressive, a discussion society not a sex club.&quot;  Ginsberg expressed the opinion that the appreciation of youthful bodies and &quot;the human form divine&quot; has been a common theme throughout the history of culture, &quot;from Rome's Vatican to Florence's Uffizi galleries to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art&quot;, and that laws regarding the issue needed to be more openly discussed.

===Demystification of drugs===
Ginsberg also talked often about drug use. Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of LSD, and, with [[Timothy Leary]], worked to promote its common use. He was also for many decades an advocate of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legalization, and, at the same time, warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his ''Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Don't Smoke):'' &quot;Don't Smoke Don't Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No / No don't smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope .&quot;

===Health===
In the 1970s Ginsberg suffered two minor strokes which were first diagnosed as [[Bell's Palsy]], which gave him significant paralysis, and stroke-like drooping of the muscles in one side of his face. When the drooping (apparent in later television interviews) did not disappear, Allen was diagnosed with [[Reynaud's disease]].
Later in life, he also suffered constant minor ailments such as high blood pressure. Much of these symptoms were related to stress, but with gaining fame and plans, he never slowed his schedule.&lt;ref&gt;''I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg''. Penguin, 2006. ISBN 978-0-14-311249-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Though early on he had intentions to be a labor lawyer, Ginsberg wrote poetry for most of his life. Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol William Blake. His admiration for the writing of [[Jack Kerouac]] inspired him to take poetry more seriously. Though he took odd jobs to support himself, in 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry. Soon after, he wrote &quot;Howl&quot;, the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life. Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at [[Brooklyn College]] from 1986 until his death.

===Inspiration from friends===
Since Ginsberg's poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the [[beat generation]] comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg's friends.

Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac's concept of &quot;spontaneous prose&quot;. He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of &quot;Howl&quot; he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing &quot;negro&quot; and &quot;angry&quot; in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

The inspiration for &quot;Howl&quot; was Ginsberg's friend, [[Carl Solomon]], and &quot;Howl&quot; is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem). Solomon was a [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to [[Artaud]]) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of [[psychotherapy|therapy]], including [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]]. Much of the final section of the first part of &quot;Howl&quot; is a description of this.

Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of &quot;[[Moloch]]&quot;. Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a [[Semitic gods|Levantine god]] to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot;, a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, [[Dylan Thomas]]. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the [[Torah]] and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by [[peyote]] visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang's film ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and of the woodcut novels of [[Lynd Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Allen Ginsberg, ''Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript &amp; Variant Versions,'' ed., Barry Miles (New York: Harper, 1986), 139–140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of &quot;Howl&quot;, which can be seen in the cited pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post–World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to ''defy'' socially created systems of control—and therefore go against Moloch—is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in &quot;Howl&quot;, such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of &quot;Howl&quot; are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a &quot;best mind&quot; destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line &quot;with mother finally ****** (fucked)&quot; comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says &quot;I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.&quot; Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write &quot;Howl&quot; was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959's &quot;Kaddish&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt; which had its first public reading at a [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with [[Thomas Merton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://catholicworker.com/peacetc.htm |title= Catholic Worker Pacifism: An Eyewitness to History

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspiration from mentors and idols===
Ginsberg's [[poetry]] was strongly influenced by [[Modernism]] (specifically [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Hart Crane]], and most importantly William Carlos Williams), [[Romanticism]] (specifically [[John Keats]]), the beat and cadence of [[jazz]] (specifically that of [[Bebop|bop]] musicians such as [[Charlie Parker]]), and his [[Kagyu]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice and [[Jewish]] background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist [[William Blake]], and the American poet [[Walt Whitman]]. The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its [[New World]] exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spontaneous&gt;Ginsberg, Allen. Spontaneous Mind: Selected Interviews, 1958–1996. Harper Perennial, 2002. ISBN 0-06-093082-9&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied poetry under William Carlos Williams, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem [[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]] about the industrial city near his home. Ginsberg, after attending a reading by Williams, sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like &quot;thee.&quot; Williams hated the poems. He told Ginsberg later, &quot;In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;

Though he hated the early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg's letter. He included the letter in a later part of ''Paterson''. He taught Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. Williams taught him to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams' own motto &quot;No ideas but in things.&quot; His time studying under Williams led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include ''Bricklayer's Lunch Hour'' and ''Dream Record''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;

Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (''To Have Done with the Judgement of God'' and ''Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society''), and Jean Genet (''Our Lady of the Flowers''). [[Philip Lamantia]] introduced him to other [[Surrealists]] and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of &quot;Kaddish&quot; were inspired by [[André Breton]]'s ''Free Union''). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of &quot;Howl&quot; and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as ''Jubilate Agno''. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: [[Franz Kafka]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and even [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;

Ginsberg also made an intense study of [[haiku]] and the paintings of [[Paul Cézanne]], from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the ''Eyeball Kick''. He noticed in viewing Cézanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would [[Saccade|spasm]], or &quot;kick.&quot; Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was &quot;hydrogen jukebox&quot; (which later became the title of a [[song cycle]] composed by [[Philip Glass]] with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg's poems). Another example is Ginsberg's observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan's hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/1999/dec/30/artsfeatures.bobdylan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A lot of nerve | date=December 30, 1999 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opiates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/the_ten_most_incomprehensible.html |title=The Ten Most Incomprehensible Bob Dylan Interviews of All Time - Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plotz |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1855/ |title=Bob Dylan - By David Plotz - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=1998-03-08 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychedelics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2001/mar/25/features.review7 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Well, how does it feel? | date=March 25, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | first=Sean | last=O'Hagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a ''[[Dexedrine]] Clown''. The phrases &quot;eyeball kick&quot; and &quot;hydrogen jukebox&quot; both show up in &quot;Howl&quot;, as well as a direct quote from Cézanne: &quot;Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;

===Style and technique===
From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friends—not to mention his own experiments—Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that's easily identified as Ginsbergian. &quot;Howl&quot; came out during a potentially hostile literary environment less welcoming to poetry outside of tradition; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by [[New Criticism]]. Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to break away from traditional poetic structure, often citing Williams, Pound, and Whitman as precursors. Ginsberg's style may have seemed to critics chaotic or unpoetic, but to Ginsberg it was an open, ecstatic expression of thoughts and feelings that were naturally poetic. He believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality. Though some, Diana Trilling, for example, have pointed to Ginsberg's occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of &quot;who came back to Denver and waited in vain&quot;), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that meter follows the natural poetic voice, not the other way around; he said, as he learned from Williams, that natural speech is occasionally dactylic, so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure, but only accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg's line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in &quot;Howl&quot;, for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths (saying perhaps it was because he talked fast, or he did yoga, or he was Jewish). The long line could also be traced back to his study of Walt Whitman; Ginsberg claimed Whitman's long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further. Whitman is often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form — though there is no direct evidence Whitman was homosexual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;

Many of Ginsberg's early long line experiments contain some sort of [[anaphoric|anaphora]], repetition of a &quot;fixed base&quot; (for example &quot;who&quot; in &quot;Howl&quot;, &quot;America&quot; in ''America'') and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg's style. He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust &quot;free flight&quot;. In the 60s, after employing it in some sections of &quot;Kaddish&quot; (&quot;caw&quot; for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;

Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole become regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of &quot;Howl&quot;, each line is in a &quot;stepped triadic&quot; format reminiscent of Williams (see ''Ivy Leaves'' for example). He abandoned the &quot;stepped triadic&quot; when he developed his long line, but the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of ''The Fall of America.'' &quot;Howl&quot; and &quot;Kaddish&quot;, arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In ''America'', he experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliberate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spontaneous&quot;/&gt;

''&quot;Lightning's blue glare fills Oklahoma plains,
''the train rolls east
''casting yellow shadow on grass
''Twenty years ago
''approaching Texas,
''I saw
''sheet lightning
''cover Heaven's corners...
''An old man catching fireflies on the porch at night
''watched the Herd Boy cross the Milky Way
''to meet the Weaving Girl...
''How can we war against that?&quot;''
(From ''Iron Horse'', composed July 22–23, 1966, while riding a train from the West Coast to Chicago. The poem was dictated to a tape recorder, and later transcribed. The second part of the poem takes place on a Greyhound bus.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' is said to be '''algebraically closed''' if every [[polynomial]] with one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] at least 1, with [[coefficient]]s in ''F'', has a [[root of a function|root]] in ''F''.

==Examples==
As an example, the field of [[real number]]s is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp; has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients (1 and 0) are real.  The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of [[rational number]]s is not algebraically closed. Also, no [[finite field]] ''F'' is algebraically closed, because if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the elements of ''F'', then the polynomial (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
has no zero in ''F''. By contrast, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] states that the field of [[complex number]]s is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) [[algebraic number]]s.

==Equivalent properties==
Given a field ''F'', the assertion “''F'' is algebraically closed” is equivalent to other assertions:

===The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if the only [[irreducible polynomial]]s in the [[polynomial ring]] ''F''[''x''] are those of degree one.

The assertion “the polynomials of degree one are irreducible” is trivially true for any field. If ''F'' is algebraically closed and ''p''(''x'') is an irreducible polynomial of ''F''[''x''], then it has some root ''a'' and therefore ''p''(''x'') is a multiple of ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''. Since ''p''(''x'') is irreducible, this means that ''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''), for some ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{0}. On the other hand, if ''F'' is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial ''p''(''x'') in ''F''[''x''] without roots in ''F''. Let ''q''(''x'') be some irreducible factor of ''p''(''x''). Since ''p''(''x'') has no roots in ''F'', ''q''(''x'') also has no roots in ''F''. Therefore, ''q''(''x'') has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in ''F''.

===Every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial ''p''(''x'') of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, with [[coefficient]]s in ''F'', [[factorization|splits into linear factors]]. In other words, there are elements ''k'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the field ''F'' such that ''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'').

If ''F'' has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in ''F''[''x''] has some root in ''F''; in other words, ''F'' is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for ''F'' if ''F'' is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field ''K'', any polynomial in ''K''[''x''] can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.

===Polynomials of prime degree have roots===
J. Shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over ''F'' of prime degree has a root in ''F'', then every non-constant polynomial has a root in ''F'', thus ''F'' is algebraically closed.

===The field has no proper algebraic extension===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper [[algebraic extension]].

If ''F'' has no proper algebraic extension, let ''p''(''x'') be some irreducible polynomial in ''F''[''x'']. Then the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of ''F''[''x''] modulo the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by ''p''(''x'') is an algebraic extension of ''F'' whose [[degree of a field extension|degree]] is equal to the degree of ''p''(''x''). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of ''p''(''x'') is&amp;nbsp;1.

On the other hand, if ''F'' has some proper algebraic extension ''K'', then the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of an element in ''K''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''F'' is irreducible and its degree is greater than&amp;nbsp;1.

===The field has no proper finite extension===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite [[algebraic extension]] because if, within the [[Algebraically closed field#The field has no proper algebraic extension|previous proof]], the word “algebraic” is replaced by the word “finite”, then the proof is still valid.

===Every endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has some eigenvector===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number ''n'', every [[linear map]] from ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' into itself has some [[eigenvector]].

An endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has an eigenvector if and only if its [[characteristic polynomial]] has some root. Therefore, when ''F'' is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has an eigenvector, let ''p''(''x'') be an element of ''F''[''x'']. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial ''q''(''x'') which has roots if and only if ''p''(''x'') has roots. But if ''q''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''q''(''x'') is the characteristic polynomial of the [[companion matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;-a_0\\1&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;-a_1\\0&amp;1&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;-a_2\\\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;1&amp;-a_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Decomposition of rational expressions===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if every [[rational function]] in one variable ''x'', with coefficients in ''F'', can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''F''.

If ''F'' is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in ''F''[''x''] are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the [[Partial fraction decomposition#Statement of theorem|theorem on partial fraction decomposition]].

On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field ''F''. Let ''p''(''x'') be an irreducible element in ''F''[''x'']. Then the rational function 1/''p'' can be written as the sum of a polynomial function ''q'' with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the rational expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac1{p(x)}-q(x)=\frac{1-p(x)q(x)}{p(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since ''p''(''x'') is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.

===Relatively prime polynomials and roots===
For any field ''F'', if two polynomials ''p''(''x''),''q''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''[''x''] are [[coprime|relatively prime]] then they don't have a common root, for if ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'' was a common root, then&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'') and &amp;nbsp;''q''(''x'') would both be multiples of ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' and therefore they would not relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.

If the field ''F'' is algebraically closed, let ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'') two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let ''r''(''x'') be their [[greatest common divisor]]. Then, since ''r''(''x'') is not constant, it will have some root ''a'', which will be then a common root of ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'').

If ''F'' is not algebraically closed, let ''p''(''x'') be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then ''p''(''x'') and ''p''(''x'') are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).

==Other properties==
If ''F'' is an algebraically closed field and ''n'' is a natural number, then ''F'' contains all ''n''th roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the ''n'' (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a ''cyclotomic extension'', and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its ''cyclotomic closure''. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.

If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of [[first-order logic]] is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic&amp;nbsp;0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic&amp;nbsp;0, but there is some natural number ''N'' such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic&amp;nbsp;''p'' when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;N.&lt;ref&gt;See subsections ''Rings and fields'' and ''Properties of mathematical theories'' in §2 of J. Barwise's &quot;An introduction to first-order logic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every field ''F'' has some extension which is algebraically closed. Among all such extensions there is one and ([[Up to|up to isomorphism]]) only one which is an [[algebraic extension]] of ''F'';&lt;ref&gt;See Lang's ''Algebra'', §VII.2 or van der Waerden's ''Algebra I'', §10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; it is called the [[algebraic closure]] of ''F''.

'''Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov''' ({{lang-ru|Анатолий Евгеньевич Карпов ''Anatolij Evgen'evič Karpov''}}; born May 23, 1951) is a [[USSR|Soviet]] / Russian [[chess]] [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] and former [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]]. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by [[Garry Kasparov]]. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming [[FIDE]] World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered one of the [[Methods for comparing top chess players throughout history#World Champions by world title reigns|greatest players]] of all time.

His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Eric | last=van Reem | title=Karpov, Kortchnoi win Unzicker Gala | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2569 | publisher=[[ChessBase|ChessBase.com]] | date=2005-08-11 | accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a peak [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is [[List of FIDE chess world number ones|second all-time]] behind only [[Garry Kasparov]] since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1971.

Since 2005, he has been a member of the [[Public Chamber of Russia]]. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of [[iodised salt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/reallives_1345.html Unicef website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at [[Zlatoust]] in the [[Urals]] region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a [[Candidate Master]] by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: &quot;The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?user=KingG|title=Anatoly Karpov's Best Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently.&lt;ref name=&quot;KarpovOnKarpov&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Karpov on Karpov: A Memoirs of a Chess World Champion | author=Karpov, A. | publisher=Atheneum | year=1992 | isbn=0689120605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik's tutelage that he became the youngest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by [[Boris Spassky]] in 1952.

==International career==
===1967–1969===
Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in [[Třinec]] several months later, ahead of [[Viktor Kupreichik]]. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered [[Moscow State University]] in 1968 to study [[mathematics]]. He later transferred to [[Leningrad State University]], eventually graduating from there in [[economics]]. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, Grandmaster [[Semyon Furman]], who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.
In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at [[Stockholm]]. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], and was awarded the [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] title.

===Top-Class Grandmaster===
He won the 1971 [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]] Memorial in Moscow (equal with [[Leonid Stein]]), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the [[USSR Chess Championship]], and finished equal first with [[Viktor Korchnoi]] in the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Interzonal]] Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 [[Candidates Matches]], which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, [[Bobby Fischer]].

==Candidate==
Karpov defeated [[Lev Polugaevsky]] by the score of +3 =5 in the first Candidates' match, earning the right to face former champion [[Boris Spassky]] in the semi-final round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates' cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates' cycle in 1977.
Spassky won the first game as Black in good style, but tenacious, aggressive play from Karpov secured him overall victory by +4 -1 =6.
The Candidates' final was played in Moscow with Korchnoi. Karpov took an early lead, winning the second game against the [[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Dragon]], then scoring another victory in the sixth game. Following ten consecutive [[draw (chess)|draws]], Korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Karpov a 3–0 lead. In game 19, Korchnoi succeeded in winning a long [[chess endgame|endgame]], then notched a speedy victory after a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] by Karpov two games later. Three more draws, the last [[draw by agreement|agreed]] by Karpov in a clearly better position, closed the match, as he thus prevailed +3 -2 =19, moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title.

===Fischer's opponent in 1975?===
Though a world championship match between Karpov and Fischer was highly anticipated, those hopes were never realised. Fischer insisted that the match be the first to ten wins ([[draw (chess)|draws]] not counting), but that the champion would retain the crown if the score was tied 9–9. [[FIDE]], the International Chess Federation, refused to allow this proviso, and FIDE declared that Fischer relinquished his crown. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.
[[Garry Kasparov]] argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Kasparov, [[My Great Predecessors]], part IV: Fischer, p. 474''&lt;/ref&gt; Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf an article] (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website [[Susan Polgar]] wrote: &quot;I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===World champion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[World Chess Championship]] --&gt;
Determined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He convincingly won the very strong [[Milan]] tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (nine) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14).
In 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 1973–75 Candidates' cycle; the match was played at [[Baguio]] in the [[Philippines]], with the winner needing six victories.
As in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match, but Korchnoi staged a  comeback late in the match, as, after the score was +5 -2 =20 in Karpov's favour, he won three of the next four games to draw level, with Karpov then winning the next game to retain the title (+6 -5 =21).

Three years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates' winner against German finalist Dr. [[Robert Hübner]] to challenge Karpov in [[Meran]], Italy. This match, however, was won handily by Karpov, the score being (11&amp;ndash;7, +6 -2 =10) in what is remembered as the &quot;Massacre in Merano&quot;.

Karpov's tournament career reached a peak at the exceptional [[Montreal]] &quot;Tournament of Stars&quot; tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7 -1 =10) with [[Mikhail Tal]], ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojevic]], Spassky, [[Vlastimil Hort]], [[Lajos Portisch]], Huebner, [[Bent Larsen]] and [[Lubomir Kavalek]]. He dominated [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]] 1977 with an incredible 13½/15. He also won the prestigious [[Bugojno]] tournament in 1978 (shared) and 1980, the [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] in 1981 (shared with [[Larry Christiansen]]) and 1994, the [[Tilburg]] tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]] in 1976, 1983, and 1988.

Karpov represented the Soviet Union at six [[Chess Olympiads]], in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal. He played first reserve at [[Skopje]] 1972, winning the board prize with 13/15. At [[Nice]] 1974, he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12/14. At [[La Valletta]] 1980, he was again board one and scored 9/12. At [[Lucerne]] 1982, he scored 6½/8 on board one. At [[Dubai]] 1986, he scored 6/9 on board two. His last was [[Thessaloniki]] 1988, where on board two he scored 8/10. In Olympiad play, Karpov lost only two games out of 68 played.

To illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11 -2 =20 versus Spassky, +5 =12 versus [[Robert Hübner]], +6 -1 =16 versus [[Ulf Andersson]], +3 -1 =10 versus [[Vasily Smyslov]], +1 =16 versus [[Mikhail Tal]], +10 -2 =13 versus Ljubojevic.

Karpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion by the time [[Garry Kasparov]] arrived on the scene. In their first match, the [[World Chess Championship 1984]], held in Moscow, with the victor again being the first to win six games outright, Karpov built a commanding 4–0 lead after nine games. The next seventeen games were drawn, setting the record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until Game 27 to gain his fifth win. In Game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which fourteen more draws ensued. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won Games 47 and 48, FIDE President [[Florencio Campomanes]] unilaterally terminated the match, citing the health of the players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov - Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages&lt;/ref&gt; The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and a staggering forty draws.

A rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called [[World Chess Championship 1984|Marathon match]] forced FIDE to return to the previous format, a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 12–12). In a hard fight, Karpov had to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but wound up losing, thus surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 11–13 (+3 -5 =16), in favor of Kasparov.

===Rivalry with Kasparov===
Karpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world #2) until the early 1990s. He fought Kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 (held in London and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]), 1987 (held in [[Seville]]), and 1990 (held in New York City and [[Lyon]]). All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11½ to 12½ (+4 -5 = 15), 12 to 12 (+4 -4 =16), and 11½ to 12½ (+3 -4 =17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.

In their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.

Karpov is on record saying that had he had the opportunity to fight Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he (Karpov) could have been a much better player as a result (in a similar way as Kasparov's constant rivalry with him helped Kasparov to achieve his full potential).

===FIDE champion again (1993–1999)===
[[Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Karpov in 1996]]
In 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against [[Nigel Short]]. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov defeated Timman – the loser of the Candidates' final against Short.

The next major meeting of Kasparov and Karpov was the 1994 [[Linares chess tournament]]. The field, in eventual finishing order, was Karpov, [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], [[Alexei Shirov|Shirov]], [[Evgeny Bareev|Bareev]], [[Vladimir Kramnik|Kramnik]], [[Joël Lautier|Lautier]], [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]], [[Gata Kamsky|Kamsky]], [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]], [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Boris Gelfand|Gelfand]], [[Miguel Illescas|Illescas]], [[Judit Polgár]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky|Beliavsky]]; with an average [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2685, the highest ever at that time, making it the first Category XVIII tournament ever held. Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament|San Remo in 1930]]), finishing 2½ points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov is considered possibly the finest of his career). This performance against the best players in the world put his [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] tournament performance at 2985, the highest performance rating of any player in history up until 2009, when [[Magnus Carlsen]] won the category XXI [[Pearl Spring chess tournament]] with a performance of 3002. However, chess statistician [[Jeff Sonas]] still considers Karpov's Linares performance as the best tournament result in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5828 Facts and figures: Magnus Carlsen's performance in Nanjing]. ChessBase.com. Retrieved on 2009-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karpov defended his FIDE title against [[Gata Kamsky]] (+6 -3 =9) in 1996. However, in 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidates' Matches, instead having a large knock-out event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998]], champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating [[Viswanathan Anand]]  (+2 -2 =2, rapid tiebreak 2:0). In the subsequent cycle, the format was changed, with the champion having to qualify. Karpov refused to defend his title, and ceased to be FIDE World Champion after the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1999]].

===Towards retirement?===
Karpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1995, since he prefers to be more involved in politics of his home country of Russia. He had been a member of the [[Supreme Soviet]] Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union dissolved. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the September 2009 FIDE rating list, he dropped out of the world's Top 100 for the first time.

Karpov usually limits his play to exhibition events, and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess. In 2002 he won a match against Kasparov, defeating him in a rapid time control match 2½-1½. In 2006, he tied for first with Kasparov in a blitz tournament, ahead of Korchnoi and Judit Polgár.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3310|title=The Credit Suisse Blitz – in pictures|date=2006.08.27|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karpov and Kasparov played a mixed 12-game match from September 21–24, 2009, in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], Spain. It consisted of four rapid (or semi rapid) and eight blitz games and took place exactly 25 years after the two players' legendary encounter at [[World Chess Championship 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://previews.chessdom.com/kasparov-karpov-valencia-2009 |title=Kasparov and Karpov to play 12 games match in Valencia |accessdate=2009-07-08 |publisher=Chessdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov won the match 9-3.

==Candidate to FIDE Presidency==
In March 2010 Karpov announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of FIDE. The election took place in September 2010 at the [[39th Chess Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/karpov-candidate-for-fide-president/#more-22636 chessvibes article]&lt;/ref&gt; In May a fund-raising event took place in New York with the participation of his former rival Garry Kasparov and of Magnus Carlsen, both of whom supported his bid and campaigned for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6343 Chessbase article on New York event]&lt;/ref&gt; Also Nigel Short has announced he supported Karpov's candidacy. However, on September 29, 2010, [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]] was reelected as President of FIDE, winning the election by 95 votes to 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reports.chessdom.com/news-2010/fide-elections-2010-ilyumzhinov-karpov |title=Kirsan Ilyumzhinov wins 2010 FIDE elections |work=Chessdom.com |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Karpov's &quot;boa constrictor&quot; playing style is solidly positional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Lubomir Kavalek|Kavalek, Lubomir]]|title=Chess|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/24/AR2007062401102.html|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=2007-06-25|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking no risks but reacting mercilessly to any tiny errors made by his opponents. As a result, he is often compared to his idol, the famous [[José Raúl Capablanca]], the third World Champion. Karpov himself describes his style as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us say the game may be continued in two ways: one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that don't yield to precise calculation; the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an endgame with microscopic chances of victory.... I would choose the latter without thinking twice. If the opponent offers keen play I don't object; but in such cases I get less satisfaction, even if I win, than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hobbies==
Karpov is known to have a large chess stamp and chess book collections. His private [[chess library]] consists of 9000 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-clone.com/articles/c4.html|title=Anatoly Karpov: The Owner of the Unique Stamp Collection|publisher=Watch-Clone.com|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|aspect ratio}}

The '''aspect ratio''' of a [[shape]] is the ratio of its longer [[dimension]] to its shorter dimension. It may be applied to two characteristic dimensions of a three-dimensional shape, such as the ratio of the longest and shortest axis, or for symmetrical objects that are described by just two measurements, such as the length and diameter of a rod. The aspect ratio of a [[torus]] is the ratio of the major axis ''R'' to the minor axis ''r''.

==Applications and uses==
The term is most commonly used with reference to:
* Graphic / image
** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]]
** [[Display aspect ratio]] - The aspect ratio for computer displays.
** [[Paper size]]
** [[Standard photographic print sizes]]
** [[Standard ad size]]
** [[Pixel aspect ratio]]
** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.
*** [[HARMST]] High Aspect Ratios allow the construction of tall structures without slant
* [[Tire code]]
* [[Tire sizing]]
* [[Aspect ratio (wing)|wing aspect ratio]] of an [[aircraft]] or [[bird]]
* [[Astigmatism]] of an [[optical lens]]

'''Auto racing''' (also known as '''automobile racing''', '''motor racing''', or '''car racing''') is a [[motorsport]] involving the [[racing]] of [[car]]s for competition. It is one of the world's most watched televised [[sports]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==History==
===The beginning of racing===
Racing began soon after the construction of the first successful gasoline-fueled automobiles. The first race ever organized was on April 28, 1887 by the chief editor of Paris publication Le Vélocipède, Monsieur Fossier.&lt;ref name=&quot;8W&quot;/&gt; It ran 2&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Neuilly Bridge to the Bois de Boulogne. It was won by [[Georges Bouton]] of the [[De Dion-Bouton]] Company, in a car he had constructed with [[Jules-Albert de Dion|Albert, the Comte de Dion]], but as he was the only competitor to show up it is rather difficult to call it a race.&lt;ref name=&quot;8W&quot;/&gt;

====Paris-Rouen. World's first motor-race====

On July 22, 1894, the Parisian magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'' organized what is considered to be the world's first car race from Paris to Rouen.&lt;ref name=&quot;8W&quot;/&gt; Sporting events were a tried and tested form of publicity stunt and circulation booster. [[Pierre Giffard]], the paper's editor, promoted it as a ''Competition for Horeseless Carriages'' (Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux) that were ''not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey''. Thus it blurred the distinctions between a reliability trial, a general event and a race, but the main prize was for the first across the finish line in Rouen. 102 people paid the 10 franc entrance fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;8W&quot;/&gt;

69 cars started the {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} selection event that would show which entrants would be allowed to start the main event, the {{convert|127|km|0|abbr=on}} race from Paris to Rouen. The entrants ranged from serious manufacturers like [[Peugeot]], [[Panhard]] or [[De Dion-Bouton|De Dion]] to amateur owners, and only 25 were selected for the main race.&lt;ref name=&quot;8W&quot;/&gt;

The race started from [[Porte Maillot (Paris Métro)|Porte Maillot]] and went through the [[Bois de Boulogne]]. Count [[Jules-Albert de Dion]] was first into Rouen after 6 hours and 48&amp;nbsp;minutes at an average speed of 19&amp;nbsp;km/h. He finished 3’30” ahead of [[Georges Lemaître]] ([[Peugeot]]), followed by [[Doriot]] (Peugeot) at 16’30”, [[René Panhard]] ([[Panhard]]) at 33’30’’ and [[Émile Levassor]] (Panhard) at 55’30”. The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics, and De Dion's steam car needed a stoker which was forbidden.&lt;ref name=&quot;8W&quot;/&gt;

===Early races===
In 1895, the [[Paris-Bordeaux-Paris Trial]] was held and this was the first real race as all competitors started together. The winner was [[Émile Levassor]] in his [[Panhard-Levassor]] 1205cc model. He completed the course (1,178&amp;nbsp;km or 732&amp;nbsp;miles) in 48 hours and 47&amp;nbsp;minutes, finishing nearly six hours before the runner-up.

The first regular auto racing venue was Nice, France, run in late March, 1897, as a &quot;Speed Week.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} To fill out the schedule, most types of racing events were invented here, including the first hill climb (Nice&amp;nbsp;– La Turbie) and a sprint that was, in spirit, the first drag race.

An international competition, between nations rather than individuals, began with the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing]].

The [[Chicago Times-Herald race|first auto race in the United States]] took place in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on November 28, 1895. The 54.36&amp;nbsp;mile (87.48&amp;nbsp;km) course ran from the South side of the city, north along the lakefront to [[Evanston, Illinois]], and back again. [[Duryea brothers|Frank Duryea]] won the race in 10 hours and 23&amp;nbsp;minutes, beating three petrol-fueled motorcars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicracing.com/index.cfm?OTDother=8&amp;fullText=1681&amp;selMonth=10&amp; Profile of Frank Duryea], Historic Racing&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parisian artist [[Ernest Montaut]], and his wife Marguerite, faithfully documented the rapidly changing face of motorised transportation in Europe. They produced large numbers of posters and prints published by ''Mabileau et Cie'', covering racing events involving motorcars, aircraft, dirigibles and speedboats. These images formed a valuable contribution to the history of transport, and particularly to its racing aspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donaldheald.com/search/search_01.php?Author=GAMY-MONTAUT Donald Heald]&lt;/ref&gt;

===City to city racing===
[[File:Fernand Gabriel Mors Paris-Madrid 1903.jpg||thumb|Fernand Gabriel driving a Mors in Paris-Madrid 1903]]
With auto construction and racing dominated by [[France]], the French automobile club ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city, in France or elsewhere in Europe.

The very successful early European rally races ended in 1903 when [[Marcel Renault]] was involved in a fatal accident near [[Angoulême]] in the Paris-Madrid race. Nine fatalities caused the French government to stop the race in [[Bordeaux]] and ban open-road racing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The longest automobile race in history, with Paris as the finish line was the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]].  Six teams from France, Italy, Germany, and the United States competed with three teams actually reaching Paris.  The American [[Thomas Flyer]] driven by [[George Schuster (driver)|George Schuster]] was declared the winner of the epic 22,000 mile race in 169 days.

&lt;!--Rallying continues: the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] is still run--&gt;

===The first purpose built racing circuits===
The [[Milwaukee Mile]] is the oldest motor racing track in the world, with racing being held there since 1903. It was not purposely built for motor racing, it started as a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) horse racing track in the 19th Century.

[[File:Brooklands Members' Banking from bridge.jpg||thumb|A remaining section of the Brooklands track today.]]
[[Brooklands]] in [[Surrey]], England, was the first purpose built motor racing venue, opening in June, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Autocar]] | volume=127 (nbr 3731) | author=Sammy Davis | authorlink=Sammy Davis | title=How Brooklands started | page=p. 43 | date=August 17, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a {{convert|4.43|km|2|abbr=on}} concrete track with high-speed banked corners. Brooklands was also a centre of the aviation industry, with [[Vickers]] setting up a factory and aerodrome there during [[World War I]]. The racing circuit was closed in 1939 as war-time aircraft production took over. Damage done to the track during [[World War II]] meant the track never reopened for racing.

Competition gradually spread to other parts of the British Empire. The first competition in India was held in 1905 by the Motor Union of Western India. It ran from Delhi to Mumbai, (Delhi-Bombay trials 1905) a distance of {{convert|810|mi|km}} in an attempt to expose India to the automobile and test its suitability for Indian conditions. Lord Curzon, the Viceroy, gave his consent to the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmsci.in/main/history.html :: The Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India ::]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WnrVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=delhi+bombay+trials+1905&amp;dq=delhi+bombay+trials+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FJ-6Nhj5GJ&amp;sig=yjq_zK8y3wMZjH1yRyzy-BKDp6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2h1uTJfDCYLInAf66L2mCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910–1950===
{{See|Grand Prix motor racing}}
The 1930s saw the transformation from high-priced road cars into pure racers, with [[Delage]], [[Auto Union]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Delahaye]], and [[Bugatti]] constructing streamlined vehicles with engines producing up to 450&amp;nbsp;kW (612&amp;nbsp;hp), aided by multiple-stage [[supercharger|supercharging]]. From 1928–1930 and again in 1934–1936, the maximum [[weight]] permitted was 750&amp;nbsp;kg, a rule diametrically opposed to current racing regulations. Extensive use of aluminum alloys was required to achieve light weight, and in the case of the Mercedes, the paint was removed to satisfy the weight limitation, producing the famous [[Silver Arrows]]. NASCAR was founded by William France, Sr., on February 21, 1948 with the help of several other drivers of the time. The first NASCAR &quot;Strictly Stock&quot; race ever was held on June 19, 1949 at [[Charlotte Speedway]]. The Strictly Stock division was put on hold as American automobile manufacturers were unable to produce family sedans quickly enough to keep up with post-World War II demand.&lt;ref name=Fleischman6&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleischman |first=Bill |coauthors=Al Pearce |title=The Unauthorized NASCAR Fan Guide (1998–99) |publisher=Visible Ink Press |year=1999 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950-Present===
After the [[Second World War]], sports car racing emerged as a distinct form of racing with its own classic races, and, from 1953, its own [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] sanctioned World Championship. [[NASCAR]]'s Strictly Stock Division was renamed the &quot;Grand National&quot; division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose-built race cars with a stock-appearing body. The first [[NASCAR]] competition held outside of the U.S. was in Canada, where on July 1, 1952, [[Buddy Shuman]] won a 200-lap race on a half-mile (800&amp;nbsp;m) dirt track in Stamford Park, Ontario, near [[Niagara Falls]].

From 1962 sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Jenkinson, Automobile Year Book Of Sports Car Racing, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1960s, as [[superspeedway]]s were built and old dirt tracks were paved, the number of dirt races was reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fielden_SI_Sep04&quot;&gt;Fielden, Greg, &quot;NASCAR Cleans Up&quot;, ''Speedway Illustrated'', September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A breed of powerful hybrids appeared in the 50s and 60s and raced on both sides of the Atlantic, featuring European chassis and large American engines - from the early [[Allard]] cars via hybrids such as [[Lotus 19]]s fitted with large engines through to the [[AC Cobra]]. The combination of mostly-British chassis and American V8 engines gave rise to the [[Can-Am]] series in the 1960s and 1970s. [[Clubmans]] provided much entertainment at club-racing level from the 1960s into the 1990s and John Webb revived interest in big sports prototypes with [[Thundersports]] in the 1980s. [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4 Grand Touring Cars]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5 Special Production Cars]] became the premier form of [[Sports car racing]] from 1976, with prototypes going into a general decline apart from [[Porsche 936]] domination at Le Mans and a lower-key series of races for smaller two-litre  [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] prototypes. The last NASCAR race on a dirt track was held on September 30, 1970 at the half-mile [[State Fairgrounds Speedway]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. From 1972 through 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] cigarette brand [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 48 to 31 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's &quot;modern era&quot;.

In Europe, the FIA adopted the ACO GTP rules virtually unchanged and sanctioned the [[Group C]] [[World Endurance Championship]] (or [[World Sportscar Championship]]), featuring high-tech closed-cockpit prototypes. In the USA, the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|Camel GTP]] series boasted close competition between huge fields of manufacturer-backed teams and privateer squads - the cars were technically similar to Group Cs but used a sliding scale of weights and engine capacities to try to limit performance. The FIA attempted to make Group C into a virtual &quot;two seater Grand Prix&quot; format in the early 1990s, with engine rules in common with F1, short race distances, and a schedule dovetailing with that of the F1 rounds. The IMSA GT Championship had been prototype-based since 1983, with less emphasis on production cars. [[Australian Production Car Championship]] was first contested in 1987, with the inaugural champion determined from the results of two races held at the [[Winton Motor Raceway]] in Victoria on 27 September. The first World Touring Car Championship, which was open to [[Group A]] Touring Cars, was held in [[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987]] concurrent to the long-running [[European Touring Car Championship]] (ETCC). Additional rounds were held outside Europe at [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] in Australia, [[Calder Park Raceway]] in Australia (using both the road course and the then newly constructed Thunderdome), [[Nissan Mobil 500|Wellington]] in New Zealand and [[Fuji Speedway|Mount Fuji]] in Japan. The Drivers Championship was won by [[Roberto Ravaglia]] in a [[BMW M3]] and the Entrants Championship was won by the Eggenberger Texaco Ford No 7 entry, which was a Ford Sierra.Winston Cup Series underwent a large boom in popularity in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoracing1.com/GoodBoys/2001/0726Part3.htm Autoracing1.com] &quot;NASCAR's Greatest Moments&amp;nbsp;—Part 3&quot;. Retrieved March 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with a decline of popularity in [[American Championship Car Racing]]. The FISA decided to separate the rally cars into three classes: Group N (production cars), Group A (modified production cars), and Group B (modified sport cars). Group B was introduced by the FIA in 1982 as replacement for both Group 4 (modified grand touring) and Group 5 (touring prototypes) cars.

The IMSA GT Series evolved into the [[American Le Mans Series]] ; which ran its first season in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Perez | first =A.J. | coauthors = | title =Le Mans series showcases prototype race cars | work =[[USA Today]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =2007-08-30 | url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2007-08-29-lemans-motor_N.htm?csp=34 | accessdate =2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the European races eventually became the closely-related [[Le Mans Series]], both of which mix prototypes and GTs. The [[SCCA World Challenge]] consists of a one hour race for each round, combining three classes: GT ([[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Aston Martin DB9]], etc.), &quot;GTS&quot; ([[Acura TSX]], [[BMW 3-series]], etc.; replaced the former touring car class), and Touring Car (a &quot;showroom stock&quot; class similar to Grand Am's Continental Challenge). NASCAR was becoming increasingly dominant and the IndyCar Series' split from CART in 1996 put more emphasis on ovals regarding domestic open-wheel racing.

The best-known variety of single-seater racing, [[Formula One]], involves an annual World Championship for drivers and constructors.

In single-seater ([[open-wheel]]) the wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce [[downforce]] and enhance adhesion to the track.  In Europe and Asia, open wheeled racing is commonly referred to as &quot;Formula&quot;, with appropriate hierarchical suffixes.  In North America, the &quot;Formula&quot; terminology is not followed (with the exception of F1).  The sport is usually arranged to follow an &quot;international&quot; format (such as F1), a &quot;regional&quot; format (such as the Formula 3 Euro Series), or a &quot;domestic&quot;, or country-specific format (such as the German Formula 3 championship, or the British Formula Ford).

In [[North America]], the cars used in the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]] (currently the [[IndyCar Series]], and previously [[Champ Car|CART]]) have traditionally been similar though less sophisticated than [[F1 cars]], with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs.
[[File:Formel3 racing car amk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Formula Three]] car racing at the [[Hockenheimring]], 2008]]

The other major international single-seater racing series is [[GP2 Series|GP2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[Formula Two]]).  Regional series include [[Formula Nippon]] and [[Formula V6 Asia]] (specifically in Asia), [[Formula Renault 3.5]] (also known as the World Series by Renault, succession series of [[World Series by Nissan]]), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Palmer Audi]] and [[Formula Atlantic]].  In 2009, the [[FIA Formula Two Championship]] brought about the revival of the F2 series. Domestic, or country-specific series include Formula Three, Formula Renault, [[Formula Ford]] with the leading introductory series being [[Formula BMW]].

Single seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers. There is a large amateur 'club racing' scene catering for those who want to race single seaters against similar people all over the world. In the UK the major club series are the [[Monoposto Racing Club]], BRSCC F3 (Formerly ClubF3, formerly ARP F3), Formula Vee and Club Formula Ford.  Each series caters for a section of the 'market', with some primarily providing low cost racing whilst others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series (BRSCC F3).

There are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts.  [[Formula Ford]] once represented a popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts and now the [[Formula BMW]] series is the preferred option as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The [[Star Mazda Series]] is another entry level series.

[[File:URE05e.jpg|thumb|right| The full electric [[Formula Student]]/[[Formula SAE]] car of the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]]]

Students at colleges and universities can also take part in single seater racing through the [[Formula SAE]] competition, which involves designing and building a single seater car in a multidisciplinary team, and racing it at the competition. This also develops other soft skills such as teamwork whilst promoting motorsport and engineering.

In 2006, producer [[Todd Baker]] was responsible for creating the world's first all-female Formula racing team. The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines, and formed for an [[MTV]] reality pilot which was shot at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].

In December, 2005 the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] gave approval to [[Superleague Formula]] racing which debuted in 2008 whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as [[AC Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]].

After 25 years away from the sport, former [[Formula 2]] champion, [[Jonathan Palmer]], reopened the F2 category again, most drivers have graduated from the [[Formula Palmer Audi]] series. The category is officially registered as the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Formula Two championship. Most rounds have two races and are support races to the [[FIA World Touring Car Championship]].

[[File:WTCC 2006 Race 10 Curitiba later.jpg|thumb|[[World Touring Car Championship]] 2006: [[Andy Priaulx]] leads at [[Curitiba]].]]
Touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production derived race cars. It often features full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.

The major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the [[V8 Supercars]] (Australia), [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM), and the [[World Touring Car Championship]]. The [[European Touring Car Cup]] is a one day event open to [[Super 2000]] specification touring cars from Europe's many national championships.

The [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S. The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory derived vehicles on various local circuits.

===Sports car racing===
{{Main|Sports car racing}}
[[File:1 and 2 Audi R8.jpg|thumb|The [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]] was one of the most successful sports prototypes ever made, seen here at Road Atlanta.]]
In [[sports car racing]], production derived versions of [[sports cars]] also known as grand tourers (GTs), and purpose built [[sports prototype]] cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits. The main global championship series for GT car racing is the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]]. There is also the [[FIA GT2 European Championship]] and the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] as well as the less powerful [[GT4 European championship]]. Other major GT championships include the Japanese [[Super GT]] championship and the [[International GT open]] for GT2 and GT3 cars. There are also national GT championships using mainly GT3 and GT4 cars featuring professional and amateur drivers alike.

Sports prototypes, unlike GT cars, do not rely on road legal cars as a base. They are closed wheel and often closed cockpit purpose built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing. They have much lower weight and more down force compared to GT cars making them much faster. They are raced in the 24 hours of Le Mans and in the (European) [[Le Mans series]], Asian Le Mans series and the American Le Mans series [[ALMS]]. These cars are referred to as [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] (Le Mans prototype) cars with LMP1 being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful LMP2 cars run by privateer teams.

These races are often conducted over long distances, at least {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}}, and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers, switching every few hours. Due to the performance difference between production-based sports cars and purpose-built sports prototypes, one race usually involves several racing classes each fighting for their own championship. Another prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States, which began in 2000, the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand-Am]], sanctions its own endurance series the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] which consists of slower and lower cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars.

Famous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[Spa 24 Hours|24 Hours of Spa]]-Franchorchamps, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and the {{convert|1000|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]]. There is also the [[24 Hours Nürburgring|24 Hours of the Nürburgring]] on the infamous Nordschleife track and the [[Dubai 24 Hour]] which is aimed at GT3 and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro-am drivers.

===Production car racing===
{{Main|Production car racing}}
Production car racing, otherwise known as &quot;showroom stock&quot; in the US, is an economical and rules-restricted version of touring car racing, mainly used to restrict costs. Numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars.

Most series follow the [[Group N]] regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that are run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]'s Firehawk Series which ran between the 1980s to 1990s all over the United States.

===One-make racing===
{{See also|One-Design|Spec racing}}
One-make, or single marque, championships often employ production-based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturer's range. There are numerous notable one-make formulae from various countries and regions, some of which&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Porsche Supercup]] and, previously, [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]&amp;nbsp;– have fostered many distinct national championships. Single marque series are often found at club level, to which the production-based cars, limited modifications, and close parity in performance are very well suited. Some of the better-known single-make series are the [[Radical European Masters]], [http://www.minichallenge.co.uk John Cooper Mini Challenge], and [[Renault Clio Cup|Clio Cup]], and at a more modest budget, [[Ginetta Cars|Ginettas]], [[Caterham Racing|Caterhams]], [[Kumho BMW Championship|BMWs]], and [[MaX5 Racing Championship|MX5s]]. There are also single-chassis [[Open wheel car|single seater]] formulae, such as [[Formula Ford]], [[Formula Renault]], [[Formula BMW]], and [[Formula Vee]], usually as &quot;feeder&quot; series for &quot;senior&quot; race formula (in the fashion of [[farm team]]s).

===Stock car racing===
[[File:NASCAR practice.jpg|thumb|right|Practice for the [[Daytona 500]].]]
{{Main|Stock car racing}}

In North America, [[stock car racing]] is the most popular form of auto racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=2&amp;id=3099978&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines | title=Addition of IndyCar champ Hornish will give Penske third Cup team | date=November 8, 2007 | work=ESPN Racing | accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily raced on [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], stock cars vaguely resemble production cars, but are in fact purpose-built racing machines which are built to tight specifications also called [[Silhouette racing car]]s.

The largest stock car racing governing body is [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing).  NASCAR's premier series is the [[Sprint Cup Series]], its most famous races being the [[Daytona 500]], [[Coca-Cola 600]], and the [[Brickyard 400]]. NASCAR also runs several feeder series, including the [[Nationwide Series]], and [[Camping World Truck Series]] (a [[pickup truck]] racing series). The series  conduct races across the entire [[continental United States]].  The [[NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]] conducts races across [[Canada]] and the [[NASCAR Corona Series]] conducts races across [[Mexico]].

NASCAR also governs several smaller regional series, such as the [[Whelen Modified Tour]]. Modified cars are best described as open-wheel cars. Modified cars have no parts, related to the &quot;stock&quot; vehicle for which they are named after. A number of Modified cars display a &quot;manufacturers&quot; logo and &quot;vehicle name&quot;. Yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer.
[[File:WorldOfOutlawsLateModel.jpg|left|thumb|A [[World of Outlaws]] late model stock car on a dirt track.]]
There are also other stock car governing bodies, such as [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] and [[United Speed Alliance Racing]].

In the UK, [[British Stock car racing]] is also referred to as &quot;Short Circuit Racing&quot;. This takes place on shale or tarmac tracks&amp;nbsp;– usually around 1/4&amp;nbsp;mile in length. The governing bodies for the sport are the Oval Racing Council (ORC) and BriSCA. Both bodies are made up of individual stadium promoters. There are around 35 tracks in the UK and upwards of 7000 active drivers. The sport is split into three basic &quot;divisions&quot;&amp;nbsp;– distinguished by the rules regarding car-contact during racing. The most famous championship is the [[British Stock Car Association|BriSCA]] [[Formula One]] stock cars. Full contact formulas include Bangers, Bombers and Rookie Bangers&amp;nbsp;– and racing features Demolitions Derbies, Figure of Eight racing and Oval Racing

Semi Contact Formulas include BriSCA F1, F2 and Superstox&amp;nbsp;– where bumpers are used tactically.

Non-contact formulas include National Hot Rods, Stock Rods and Lightning Rods.

UK Stock car racing started in the 1950s and grew rapidly through the 60s and 70s.

===Rallying===

[[File:Neste Oil Rally 2010 - Jari-Matti Latvala in shakedown.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jari-Matti Latvala]] driving the [[Ford Focus WRC|Ford Focus RS WRC 09]] in [[2010 Rally Finland]].]]
[[Rallying]] at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] road legal production based car; [[Group N]] Production cars and more modified [[Group A]] cars. Cars compete on (closed) public roads or off-road areas run on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers &quot;rally&quot; to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of &quot;special stages&quot; of any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as &quot;pace notes.&quot; During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event's special stages, including penalties.

The top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), but there also regional championships and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], [[Rally Argentina]], [[Rally Finland]] and [[Rally GB]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a &quot;[[rally raid]]&quot;) is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]]. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]] which are popular with amateurs, making up the &quot;grass roots&quot; of motor sports.  Cars at this level may not comply fully with the requirements of [[group A]] or [[group N]] [[Homologationn (motorsport)|homologation]].
Rallying is the most widely used motor sport around the world as it can race on any circuit type. As well as the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] other major rally events include the [[British Rally Championship]], [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]], [[African Rally Championship]], [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship]] and endurance rally events like the [[Dakar Rally]].

===Targa racing (Targa Rally)===
{{Main|Rallying}}
[[File:TargaTasmaniaRacer1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Toyota MR2]] , driven by [[Adam Spence (race driver)|Adam Spence]] in the 2006 Targa Tasmania prologue stage.]]
'''Targa''' is a tarmac-based road [[rally racing|rally]] which is run all around the world. This began with the [[Targa Florio]]. There are many races including [[Targa Tasmania]] held on the Australian island state of Tasmania run annually since 1992. The event takes its name from the [[Targa Florio]], a former motoring event held on the island of [[Sicily]]. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the Mille Miglia, the Coupe des Alpes and the Tour de Corse. Other events around the world include the [[Targa Newfoundland]] based in Canada, [[Targa West]] based in [[Western Australia]], [[Targa New Zealand]] and other smaller events.

===Drag racing===
{{Main|Drag racing}}
In drag racing, the objective is to complete a given straight-line distance, from a standing start, ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane. This distance is traditionally ¼ mile (400&amp;nbsp;m), though ⅛ mile (200&amp;nbsp;m) has become popular since the 1990s. The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built [[drag racing|dragster]]. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the ¼ mile in 12 to 16&amp;nbsp;seconds, whereas a [[top fuel dragster]] takes 4.5&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to {{convert|530|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Drag racing was organized as a sport by [[Wally Parks]] in the early 1950s through the [[NHRA]] (National Hot Rod Association). The NHRA was formed to discourage [[street racing]].

When launching, a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 3.4 [[g-force|g]] (33&amp;nbsp;m/s²), and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is 4&amp;nbsp;g (39&amp;nbsp;m/s²), more than the [[Space Shuttle]] experiences. A top fuel car can be heard over 8&amp;nbsp;miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) away and can generate a reading from 1.5 to 3.9 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://topfuel.nhra.com/blog/nhra-notebook/2007/07/26/22660/ | title=Herbert's engine thunders to 3.9 on Richter scale | date=July 26, 2007 | work=NHRA.com | accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag racing is two cars head-to-head, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]]) using an index (a lowest e.t. allowed), and cars running under (quicker than) their index &quot;break out&quot; and lose. The slowest cars, bracket racers, are also handicapped, but rather than an index, they use a &quot;dial-in&quot;. Bracket racing has been viewed as the main cause of the loss of public interest in drag racing. People do not understand why the slower car wins or why somebody needs to hit the brakes to avoid going too fast. Many local tracks have also complained that bracket racers will also go out of their way to spend as little as possible while at the track by bringing their own food, beverages, fuel, and supplies; thus, making it more difficult for tracks to make money on these events. This causes gate prices to rise and tracks losing interest in having such events.

===Off-road racing===
{{Main|Off-road racing}}
In [[off-road racing]], various classes of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous [[Baja 1000]].
In Europe, &quot;offroad&quot; refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the [[Paris-Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar]], [[Master Rallye]] or European &quot;bajas&quot; are called &quot;cross-country rallies.&quot;

===Kart racing===
[[File:AtwaterSat394.jpg|thumb|A sprint kart race in Atwater California hosted by the International Karting Federation.]]
{{Main|Kart racing}}
Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, [[kart racing]], or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]]. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably [[Wayne Rainey]], who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to go racing, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.

Despite their diminutive size, karting's most powerful class, [[superkart]], can have a power-to-weight ratio of 440&amp;nbsp;hp/tonne.

===Historical racing===
{{Main|Historic motorsport}}
[[File:Monterey Historic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laguna Seca]], [[Monterey]], 2008]]
As modern motor racing is centered on modern technology with a lots of corporate sponsors and politics involved, [[historical racing]] tends to be the opposite. Because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented, reducing corporate sponsorship and politics. Events are regulated to only allow cars of a certain era to participate. The only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing. A historical event can be of various different motorsport disciplines. Notably some of the most famous events of them all are the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] and [[Goodwood Revival]] in Britain and [[Monterey Historic]] in the United States. Championships range from &quot;grass root&quot; [[Austin Seven]] racing to the [[FIA Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship]] for classic [[Formula One]] chassis.

While there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing, this branch of [[auto sport]] tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and laid back in its approach.

==Use of flags==
{{Main|Racing flags}}

In many types of auto races, particularly those held on closed courses, flags are displayed to indicate the general status of the track and to communicate instructions to competitors. While individual series have different rules, and the flags have changed from the first years (e.g., red used to start a race), these are generally accepted.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|Full course caution condition for ovals. On road courses, it means a local area of caution. Depending on the type of racing, either two yellow flags will be used for a full course caution or a sign with 'SC' ([[Safety car]]) will be used as the field follows the [[pace car|pace/safety car]] on track and no cars may pass.

==Racing car setup==
{{Main|Racing setup}}
In auto racing, the [[racing setup]] or car setup is the set of adjustments made to the vehicle to optimize its behaviour (performance, [[Car handling|handling]], reliability, etc.). Adjustments can occur in [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspensions]], brakes, [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]], engines, tires, and many others.

For an earlier published use of &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; by Rothbard, see his [http://anthonyflood.com/rothbardknowyourrights.htm &quot;Know Your Rights&quot;] ''WIN: Peace and Freedom through Nonviolent Action'', Volume 7, No. 4, March 1, 1971, 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In an anarcho-capitalist society, [[Police|law enforcement]], [[court]]s, and all other security services would be provided by voluntarily-funded competitors such as [[private defense agencies]] rather than through [[tax]]ation, and [[money]] would be [[free banking|privately and competitively provided]] in an open market. According to anarcho-capitalists, personal and [[economic]] activities would be regulated by the [[natural law]]s of the [[market]] and through [[private law]] rather than through [[politics]]. Furthermore, [[victimless crime]]s and [[crime]]s against the state would not exist.

Anarcho-capitalists argue for a society based on the voluntary trade of [[private property]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] (including money, consumer goods, land, and capital goods) in order to maximize individual liberty and prosperity. However, they also recognize [[Charity (practice)|charity]] and communal arrangements as part of the same voluntary ethic.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Karl. [http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/dop.html The Death of Politics]. Interview in Playboy Magazine, March 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Though anarcho-capitalists are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some propose that non-state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho-capitalist society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holcombe&quot;/&gt; For them, what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from the compulsory [[State (polity)|state]]. Anarcho-capitalist [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the only just, and/or most economically beneficial, way to acquire property is through voluntary [[trade]], gift, or labor-based [[homestead principle (ethics)|original appropriation]], rather than through aggression or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Abridged Paperback Edition (1996), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists see [[free-market]] [[capitalism]] as the basis for a free and prosperous society. [[Murray Rothbard]] said that the difference between free-market capitalism and &quot;[[state capitalism]]&quot; is the difference between &quot;peaceful, voluntary exchange&quot; and a collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N., [http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559 A Future of Peace and Capitalism]; Murray N. Rothbard, [http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?control=910 Left and Right: The Prospects for Liberty].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Capitalism,&quot; as anarcho-capitalists employ the term, is not to be confused with [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[crony capitalism]], [[corporatism]], or contemporary [[mixed economies]], wherein market incentives and disincentives may be altered by state action.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press 2001. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; So they reject the state, based on the belief that states are aggressive entities which steal property (through [[taxation]] and [[Confiscation|expropriation]]), initiate aggression, are a compulsory monopoly on the use of force, use their coercive powers to benefit some businesses and individuals at the expense of others, create monopolies, restrict [[trade]], and restrict personal freedoms via [[drug laws]], [[compulsory education]], [[conscription]], laws on food and morality, and the like. The embrace of unfettered [[capitalism]] leads to considerable tension between anarcho-capitalists and many [[social anarchists]] that view [[capitalism]] and its [[market]] as just another authority. Anti-capitalist anarchists generally consider anarcho-capitalism a contradiction in terms&lt;ref&gt;[[David Weick]], ''Anarchist Justice'', pp. 223-224; [[Peter Sabatini]], ''Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy''; Kropotkin, ''Anarchism'';&lt;/ref&gt;, and vice versa.

==Philosophy==
===Varieties of anarcho-capitalism===
[[File:600pxanarchocapitalismsymbol.png|100px|right|&quot;Circle-A&quot; anarchy symbol with dollar sign]]Various theorists have differing, though similar, legal philosophies which are considered to fall under &quot;anarcho-capitalism.&quot; The first well-known version of anarcho-capitalism was formulated by [[Austrian School]] [[economist]] and [[libertarian]] [[Murray Rothbard]] in the mid-twentieth century, synthesizing elements from the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]], [[classical liberalism]], and nineteenth century American [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the normative implications they derived from it).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the nineteenth century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.&quot; Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, ISBN 978-0-631-17944-3, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; In Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism, there would first be the implementation of a mutually agreed-upon libertarian &quot;legal code which would be generally accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. For A New Liberty. [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty11.asp 12 The Public Sector, III: Police, Law, and the Courts]&lt;/ref&gt; This legal code would recognize [[sovereignty of the individual]] and the [[non-aggression principle|principle of non-aggression]]. However, in [[David D. Friedman]]'s anarcho-capitalism, &quot;the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;koltwm&quot;&gt;Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom''. Second edition. La Salle, Ill, Open Court, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; which he believes would lead to a generally libertarian society if not an absolute one.

Rothbard bases his philosophy on absolutist [[natural law]] grounds but also gives economic explanations of why he thinks anarcho-capitalism is preferable on pragmatic grounds. Friedman says he is not an absolutist rights theorist but is also &quot;not a utilitarian&quot;, however, he does believe that &quot;utilitarian arguments are usually the best way to defend libertarian views&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David D. The Machinery of Freedom. Chapter 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leeson]] argues that &quot;the case for anarchy derives its strength from empirical evidence, not theory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leeson, Peter. &quot;Anarchy Unbound; Or, Why Self-Governance Works Better Than You Think.&quot; ''[[Cato Institute]]'', August 6, 2007. [http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/06/peter-t-leeson/anarchy-unbound-or-why-self-governance-works-better-than-you-think/ Cato-Unbound.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], meanwhile, uses &quot;[[discourse ethics#Libertarian approaches|argumentation ethics]]&quot; for his foundation of &quot;private property anarchism&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanshoppe.com/sel-topics.php#arg-ethics Hans-Hermann Hoppe &quot;Argumentation Ethics&quot;]. Retrieved 6 February 2007. {{Wayback | url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/sel-topics.php#arg-ethics  | date=20061213035545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is closer to Rothbard's natural law approach.

===Nonaggression axiom===
{{Main|self-ownership|non-aggression axiom}}

{{quotation|&quot;I define [[anarchist]] society as one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against the person or property of any individual. Anarchists oppose the State because it has its very being in such aggression, namely, the expropriation of private property through taxation, the coercive exclusion of other providers of defense service from its territory, and all of the other depredations and coercions that are built upon these twin foci of invasions of individual rights.&quot; -[[Murray Rothbard]] in ''Society and State''}}

Anarcho-capitalism, as formulated by Rothbard and others, holds strongly to the central [[libertarian]] ''nonaggression axiom'':

:[...] The basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a [[self-ownership|self owner]], having absolute jurisdiction over his own body. In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person. It follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or &quot;mixes his labor with&quot;. From these twin axioms&amp;nbsp;– self-ownership and &quot;[[Homestead principle (ethics)|homesteading]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;– stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society. This system establishes the right of every man to his own person, the right of donation, of bequest (and, concomitantly, the right to receive the bequest or inheritance), and the right of contractual exchange of property titles.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf &quot;Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution&quot;] Cato Journal 2, No. 1 (Spring 1982): pp. 55–99. Retrieved 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e., a just [[natural law]] that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1982.2&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp ''The Ethics of Liberty''] Humanities Press ISBN 978-0-8147-7506-6:p162 Retrieved 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the nonaggression axiom can be said to be a prohibition against the initiation of force, or the threat of force, against persons (i.e., direct violence, [[assault]], [[murder]]) or property (i.e., fraud, [[burglary]], theft, taxation).&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty.asp ''For a new Liberty''] Collier Books, A Division of Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York: pp.24–25. Retrieved 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The initiation of force is usually referred to as [[aggression]] or [[coercion]]. The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[List of libertarian political parties|libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public [[police]], [[court]]s and [[military]]; others, however, might give further allowance for other government programs.  In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of state intervention, defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and, as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression, an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1982.2&quot;/&gt;

Some anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the nonaggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or [[natural law]] basis. It is in terms of the non-aggression principle that Rothbard defined [[anarchism]]; he defined &quot;anarchism as a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']&quot; and said that &quot;what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1975) [http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_01.pdf ''Society Without A State (pdf)''] ''Libertarian Forum'' newsletter (January 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''New Banner'', Rothbard said that &quot;capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html ''Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard''] The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal (25 February 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property===
====Private property====
Central to anarcho-capitalism are the concepts of [[self-ownership]] and [[homestead principle (ethics)|original appropriation]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone is the proper owner of his own physical body as well as of all places and nature-given goods that he occupies and puts to use by means of his body, provided only that no one else has already occupied or used the same places and goods before him. This ownership of &quot;originally appropriated&quot; places and goods by a person implies his right to use and transform these places and goods in any way he sees fit, provided only that he does not change thereby uninvitedly the physical integrity of places and goods originally appropriated by another person. In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in [[John Locke]]'s phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary&amp;nbsp;– contractual&amp;nbsp;– transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoppe-2002&quot;&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2002) [http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html &quot;Rothbardian Ethics&quot;] Retrieved 23 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anarcho-capitalism uses the following terms in ways that may differ from common usage or various anarchist movements.
* '''Anarchism:''' any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (includes opposition to the State)
* '''Contract:''' a voluntary binding agreement between persons
* '''Coercion:''' physical force or threat of such against persons or property
* '''Capitalism:''' economic system where the means of production are privately owned, and where investments, production, distribution, income, and prices are determined through the operation of a free market rather than by government
* '''Free market:''' a market where all decisions regarding transfer of money, goods (including capital goods), and services are voluntary
* '''Fraud:''' inducing one to part with something of value through the use of dishonesty
* '''State:''' an organization that taxes and engages in regularized and institutionalized aggressive coercion
* '''Voluntary:''' any action not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by any human agency

This is the root of anarcho-capitalist [[property rights]], and where they differ from [[collectivism|collectivist]] forms of anarchism such as [[anarcho-communism]] where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed &quot;according to need.&quot; Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e. ''private'') ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual &quot;needs&quot; or does not need. As Rothbard says, &quot;if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made.&quot;  After property is created through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift; forced transfers are considered illegitimate.  Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land, and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same &quot;absolute right&quot; as his own body.  According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it; it is only by ''using'' land&amp;nbsp;– by mixing one's labor with it&amp;nbsp;– that original appropriation is legitimized: &quot;Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.&quot; Rothbard notes that the resource need not ''continue'' to be used in order for it to be the person's property, &quot;for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns’ in perpetuity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1962&quot;&gt;[[Rothbard, Murray N.]] (1962) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap2d.asp Ludwig von Mises Institute] ''[[Man, Economy &amp; State]] with [[Power and Market]]'' [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] ISBN 978-0-945466-30-7 ch2 Retrieved 19 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As a practical matter, in terms of the ownership of land, anarcho-capitalists recognize that there are few (if any) parcels of land left on Earth whose ownership was not at some point in time obtained in violation of the homestead principle, through seizure by the state or put in private hands with the assistance of the state. Rothbard says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not enough to call simply for defense of &quot;the rights of private property&quot;; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be &quot;private&quot; must now be defended by libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rothbard says in &quot;Justice and Property Right&quot; that &quot;any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property.&quot; In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases &quot;the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed.&quot; He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the &quot;[[homestead principle (ethics)|homestead principle]]&quot;. If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector: &quot;any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible.&quot; For example, he proposes that [[State university|State universities]] be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally &quot;private property&quot; if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers. He says, &quot;What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not &quot;private&quot; property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property.&quot; Likewise, Karl Hess says, &quot;libertarianism wants to advance ''principles'' of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private...Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Karl (1969) ''[http://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf  Letter From Washington]'' The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:

:&quot;For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, [[rape]], trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the [[ethics]] of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoppe-2002&quot;/&gt;

=====Intellectual property=====
The positions on [[intellectual property]] vary according to the anarcho-capitalist theorist. Libertarian views range from support for all, to opposition to all intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Kinsella, Stephen. [http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf Against Intellectual Property]. Journal of Libertarian Studies. Volume 15, no. 2 (Spring 2001): 1–53&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard argues that [[patents]] are coercive monopolistic privileges granted by the state, and says they would not exist in a free society, because they prohibit individuals from independently coming up with the same invention. On the other hand, he holds that [[copyrights]] are in some situations compatible with a free society. His argument is that when a copyright notice is on a piece of literary work this is a signal that the creator of the work does not consent to anyone to using it unless they agree not to copy it, hence if it is used this constitutes a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Man, Economy &amp; State. [http://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10e.asp#7._Patents_Copyrights Mises.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Stephan Kinsella]]&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, Stephan. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/kinsella/kinsella15.html What It Means to Be an Anarcho-capitalist]. 2004 LewRockwell.com&lt;/ref&gt; opposes both patent and copyright intellectual property.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

====Common property====
Though anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers, and portions of oceans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holcombe&quot;&gt;Holcombe, Randall G., [http://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_1.pdf Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 19, No. 2 (Spring 2005):3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist theorist [[Roderick Long]] gives the following example:

:&quot;Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community it's hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen branches in the way. But over time the way is cleared and a path forms&amp;nbsp;—not through any coordinated efforts, but simply as a result of all the individuals walking by that way day after day. The cleared path is the product of labor&amp;nbsp;—not any individual's labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the villagers together have earned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T. 199. &quot;A Plea for Public Property.&quot; Formulations 5, no. 3 (Spring)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, since property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership to the extent of the number of owners—or make such accountability proportionately more complex, anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional [[communal]] arrangements. [[Privatization]], [[decentralization]], and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. But in some cases, they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.

Anarcho-capitalists tend to concur with [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalists]] regarding the environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements. Air, water, and land [[pollution]], for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. Central governments generally strike down individual or [[class action]] censure of polluters in order to benefit &quot;the many&quot;, and legal or economic [[subsidy]] of [[heavy industry]] is justified by many [[politician]]s for [[job creation]] within a political territory.

===Contractual society===
[[File:Althing-stamp.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A postage stamp celebrating the thousandth anniversary of the [[Althing|Icelandic parliament]]. According to a theory associated with the economist [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], [[Icelandic Commonwealth|medieval Icelandic society]] had some features of anarcho-capitalism. Chieftaincies could be bought and sold, and were not geographical monopolies; individuals could voluntarily choose membership in any chieftain's clan.]]

The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the ''Contractual Society''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;... a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1962&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements ([[contract]]s) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.

One particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntary on the part of ''both'' parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer [[insurance]] and [[Bereavement benefit|death benefits]] to [[same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]; another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.

Rothbard points out that corporations would exist in a free society, as they are simply the pooling of capital. He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: &quot;Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation ....&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1962&quot;/&gt;

Corporations created in this way would not, however, be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy.  Rothbard himself acknowledges that &quot;limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy &amp; State with Power and Market, [http://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11 Mises.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself asserts that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1982.2&quot;/&gt; and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will, which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nozick-1973&quot;&gt;[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, David Friedman has expressed preference for a society where &quot;almost everyone is self-employed&quot; and &quot;instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper &amp; Row. pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.

===Law and order and the use of violence===
Different anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism, and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. Morris and Linda Tannehill, in ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', object to any [[statute|statutory]] law whatsoever. They assert that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see [[tort]] and [[contract]] law) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Susan Love, ''The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View'', Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray Rothbard, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized [[libertarian]] legal code which private courts would pledge to follow. Such a code for Internet commerce, called  ''The Common Economic Protocols'' was developed by Andre Goldman.

Unlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an [[ideological]] commonality of [[ethics]] and [[morality]] as a requirement, David Friedman proposes that &quot;the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;koltwm&quot;/&gt; Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society &quot;remains to be proven.&quot; He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs. But, he thinks this would be rare. He reasons that &quot;if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims, that law...will not survive in an anarcho-capitalist society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper &amp; Row. pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty (i.e., courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. But, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force. That is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial, and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. Also, if competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists. According to Molinari, &quot;Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Molinari-1849&quot;&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] ''(trans.

The defense of those unable to pay for such protection might be financed by charitable organizations relying on voluntary donation rather than by state institutions relying on coercive taxation, or by cooperative self-help by groups of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N.

[[File:The death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Murray Rothbard]] admired the [[American Revolution]] and believed it is the only U.S. war that can be justified.]]

Like classical liberalism, and unlike [[anarcho-pacifism]], anarcho-capitalism permits the use of force, as long as it is in the defense of persons or property. The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. [[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe [[prison]]s or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations, while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf &quot;Retribution versus Restitution&quot;] Legal Notes No.5, Libertarian Alliance ISBN 978-1-870614-22-1 Retrieved 19 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce L. Benson]] notes that, in the interest of deterring crime, legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that, despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, &quot;standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Bruce|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]]|year=1998|pages=235–238|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. But the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk, and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|url=http://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf|pages=105–106|isbn=978-0-930073-08-4|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]]) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire [[the American Revolution]] as the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties. In fact, according to Murray Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [http://www.antiwar.com/orig/rothbard_on_war.html Interview] ''Reason'' February 1973. Retrieved 10 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some anarcho-capitalists, such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], feel that violent revolution is counter-productive and prefer voluntary forms of [[economic secession]] to the extent possible.

==History and influences==
===Classical liberalism===
{{Main|Classical liberalism}}
[[File:molinari.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819–1912).]]

[[Classical liberalism]] is the primary influence with the longest history on anarcho-capitalist theory. Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man, and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]], while limiting the [[State (polity)|state]] was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].

In the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Frederic Bastiat]] (''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]''),  who wrote, &quot;The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else.&quot; [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote, &quot;I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/civ.dis.html Civil Disobedience] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property, and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The &quot;normative core&quot; of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of [[laissez-faire]], a [[spontaneous order]] of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants.&lt;ref&gt;Razeen, Sally. ''Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History'', Routledge (UK) ISBN 978-0-415-16493-1, 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services, and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So, they advocated what may be seen as classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later, in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. Molinari, in his essay ''The Production of Security'', argued, &quot;No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.&quot;  Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] asserts that what these liberal philosophers &quot;had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people&amp;nbsp;– society&amp;nbsp;– and the institutions of force&amp;nbsp;– the State.  This ''society versus state'' idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority, and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molinari-1849&quot;/&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]], as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].

Ulrike Heider, in discussing the &quot;anarcho-capitalists family tree,&quot; notes [[Max Stirner]] as the &quot;founder of individualist anarchism&quot; and &quot;ancestor of [[laissez-faire liberalism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp.  95–96&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heider, Stirner wants to &quot;abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members&quot; and &quot;derives his identity solely from property&quot; with the question of property to be resolved by a '[[Bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]'.&quot; Stirner argued against the existence of the state in a fundamentally anti-collectivist way, to be replaced by a &quot;Union of Egoists&quot; but was not more explicit than that in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' published in 1844.

Later, in the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the &quot;[[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]]&quot;.  These were minarchist, antiwar, anti-imperialist, and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers.  Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]], and [[H. L. Mencken]].  In the 1950s, the new &quot;fusion conservatism&quot;, also called &quot;[[cold war]] conservatism&quot;, took hold of the right wing in the U.S., stressing anti-communism.  This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right, and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the (U.S.) Libertarian Party.

===Nineteenth century individualist anarchism in the United States===
[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lysander Spooner]] (1808–87).]]
{{details|Anarchism in the United States}}

Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by these men. Most had not evolved consciously from this tradition; they had been a rather automatic product of the American environment.&quot; DeLeon, David. The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism. [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1978, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; (who were also influenced by classical liberalism).  In the winter of 1949, influenced by several nineteenth-century individualists anarchists, Rothbard decided to reject minimal state laissez-faire and embrace individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, David. The Essential Rothbard. Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard said in 1965&lt;ref name=&quot;Spooner-Tucker Doctrine&quot;&gt;&quot;The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View.&quot; A Way Out. May–June, 1965. Later republished in Egalitarianism As A Revolt Against Nature by Rothbard, 1974. Later published in Journal of Libertarian Studies, 2000. [http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Lysander Spooner and Benjamin T. Tucker were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy.&quot; However, he thought they had a faulty understanding of economics. The 19th century individualists had a [[labor theory of value]], as influenced by the [[classical economics|classical economists]], but Rothbard was a student of [[neoclassical economics]] which does not agree with the labor theory of value. So, Rothbard sought to meld 19th century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: &quot;There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;&quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View], Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it. Rothbard disagreed with this, as he explains in ''The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View''. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase, because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur, so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless, because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Also, Tucker held a labor theory of value. As a result, he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or &quot;usury&quot; was taking place. As he explains in ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated, and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. Again, as a neoclassical economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory. He believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to [[marginal utility]] rather than to labor amounts in free market. And he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much others subjectively value their labor or what that labor produces, even if it means people laboring the same amount receive different incomes.

[[Benjamin Tucker]] opposed vast concentrations of [[wealth]], which he believed were made possible by government intervention and state protected monopolies. He believed the most dangerous state intervention was the requirement that individuals obtain charters in order to operate banks and what he believed to be the illegality of issuing private money, which he believed caused capital to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few which he called the &quot;banking monopoly.&quot; He believed anyone should be able to engage in banking that wished, without requiring state permission, and issue private money. Though he was supporter of laissez-faire, late in life he said that State intervention had allowed some extreme concentrations of resources to such a degree that even if laissez-faire were instituted, it would be too late for competition to be able to release those resources (he gave Standard Oil as an example).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html State Socialism and Anarchism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking. They, like all [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economists, believe that monopoly can only come about through government intervention. 19th-century American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economy.  Although anarcho-capitalists disagree on the critical topics of [[Profit (economics)|profit]], social egalitarianism, and the proper scope of private property, both schools of thought agree on other issues.  Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of &quot;sovereignty of the individual&quot;, a market economy, and the opposition to [[collectivism]]. A defining point that they agree on is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the State. Tucker said, &quot;[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. &quot;Instead of a Book&quot; (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; But, again, since anarcho-capitalists disagree with Tucker's labor theory of value, they disagree that free market competition would cause protection (or anything else) to be provided &quot;at cost.&quot; Like the 19th-century American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner, anarcho-capitalists believe that land may be originally appropriated by, and only by, occupation or use; however, most American individualists of the nineteenth-century believed it must ''continually'' be in use to retain title. Lysander Spooner was an exception from those who believed in the &quot;occupation and use&quot; theory, and believed in full private property rights in land, like Rothbard.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Watner|Watner, Carl]]. [http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_03.pdf Spooner Vs. Liberty] in The Libertarian Forum. March 1975. Volume VII, No 3. ISSN 0047-4517. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austrian School===
{{Main|Austrian School}}
The Austrian School of economics was founded with the publication of [[Carl Menger]]'s 1871 book ''[[Principles of Economics]]''. Members of this school approach economics as an ''a priori'' system like logic or mathematics, rather than as an empirical science like geology. It attempts to discover axioms of human action (called &quot;[[praxeology]]&quot; in the Austrian tradition) and make deductions therefrom.  Some of these praxeological axioms are:
:* humans act purposefully;
:* humans prefer more of a good to less;
:* humans prefer to receive a good sooner rather than later; and
:* each party to a trade benefits ''[[ex ante]]''.

Even in the early days, Austrian economics was used as a theoretical weapon against socialism and statist socialist policy. [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], a colleague of Menger, wrote one of the first critiques of socialism ever written in his treatise ''The Exploitation Theory of Socialism-Communism''. Later, [[Friedrich Hayek]] wrote ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', asserting that a [[command economy]] destroys the information function of prices, and that authority over the economy leads to [[totalitarianism]]. Another very influential Austrian economist was [[Ludwig von Mises]], author of the praxeological work ''[[Human Action]]''.
[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926–95).]]
Murray Rothbard, a student of Mises, is the man who attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating &quot;private property anarchism&quot; in 1949, and later came up with the alternative name &quot;anarcho-capitalism.&quot; He was probably the first to use &quot;libertarian&quot; in its current (U.S.) pro-capitalist sense. He was a trained economist, but also knowledgeable in history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an anti-statist and anti-[[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]], but later had a falling out. When interventionist [[cold warrior]]s of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], gained influence in the Republican party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and formed an alliance with [[left-wing]] [[antiwar]] groups, noting an antiwar tradition among a number of self-styled left-wingers and to a degree closer to the Old Right conservatives. He believed that the cold warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially in regards to [[Trotskyist]] theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard16.html LewRockwell.com]. Retrieved 10 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Rothbard initially opposed the founding of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists. Rothbard's books, such as ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'', ''[[Power and Market]]'', ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]'', and ''[[For a New Liberty]]'', are considered by some to be classics of natural law libertarian thought.

==Historical precedents similar to anarcho-capitalism==
{{See also|List of anarchist communities}}
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
To the extent that anarcho-capitalism is thought of as a theory or [[ideology]]—rather than a social process—critics say that it is unlikely ever to be more than a [[utopian]] ideal.  Some, however, point to actual situations where protection of individual liberty and property has been voluntarily funded rather than being provided by a state through taxation.

===Medieval Iceland===
According to [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], &quot;[[Icelandic Commonwealth|Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-79&quot;&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had &quot;some features&quot; of an anarcho-capitalist society&amp;nbsp;– while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  &quot;Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially &quot;public&quot; offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-79&quot;/&gt;

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that &quot;private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved,&quot; and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The [[land club]]s and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, &quot;Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L. Anderson, Free-Market Environmentalist|author=Probasco, Christian|date=6-18-08|publisher=New West|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Pennsylvania===

Murray Rothbard's history of Colonial America ''[[Conceived in Liberty]]'' discussed a period where [[Pennsylvania]] fell into a state of anarchism and how [[William Penn]] struggled for about a decade to reinstate his government over a people who did not want it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard81.html |title=Pennsylvania's Anarchist Experiment: 1681–1690 by Murray N. Rothbard |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical and material variance among anarcho-capitalists==
{{See also|Deontological libertarianism|Consequentialist libertarianism}}
A notable dispute within the anarcho-capitalist movement concerns the question of whether anarcho-capitalist society is justified on [[deontological]] or [[consequentialist]] ethics, or both. Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. This latter approach, which has been called the [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] version&lt;ref&gt;Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; has been offered by [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''. Also unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on &quot;[[market failure]]&quot;, nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-1973&quot;/&gt;

In addition to differences over justifications, there are differences in regard to the systems proposed. In Friedman's version, private defense or protection agencies and courts not only defend legal rights but supply the actual content of these rights and all claims on the market. People will have the law system they pay for, and because of [[economic efficiency]] considerations resulting from individuals' utility functions, such law will tend to be libertarian in nature but will differ from place to place and from agency to agency depending on the tastes of the people who buy the law.

Rothbardian anarcho-capitalists lean toward [[libertarian]] political deactivism in which political means are used to speed the obsolescence of the state. Friedmanites, on the other hand, prefer to rely more heavily on market processes in the evolution of [[polycentric law]] by centering on [[tort]] and [[contract]] law, and by exposing the inefficiencies and inconsistencies of [[criminal law]], or crimes against the state.

==Criticism of anarcho-capitalism==
{{Main|Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism}}

Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism fall into several categories: [[statist]] criticisms that hold that anarcho-capitalism is unworkable in practice; critiques that hold that capitalism requires a coercive force (public or private) to exist and that a society can be anarchist or capitalist, but not both; general critiques of the morality of capitalism and liberalism, which also apply to anarcho-capitalism; and a utilitarian critique, which asserts that anarcho-capitalism would not maximize utility.

Another critique is that an anarcho-capitalist society would degenerate into a &quot;[[Bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]&quot;. Other critics argue that the [[free rider problem]] makes the provision of protection services in an anarcho-capitalist society impractical.

===Another state would replace the first===
It can be argued that a [[private defense agency]] would inevitably gain a military monopoly through [[economy of scale]] thus securing significant market power and undermining potential entrants into the market. Anarcho-capitalists cite the power of market competition as a check on monopoly, the defensive nature of private security, and the level of offensive force that is required to prevent competition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

On page 41 of ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', [[Linda &amp; Morris Tannehill]] write that &quot;[Government] attracts the worst kind of men to its ranks, shackles progress, forces its citizens to act against their own judgment, and causes recurring internal and external strife by its coercive existence.  In view of all this, the question becomes not, “Who will protect us from aggression?” but “Who will protect us from the governmental ‘protectors’?”  The contradiction of hiring an agency of institutionalized violence to protect us from violence is even more foolhardy than buying a cat to protect one’s parakeet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda &amp; Morris Tannehill]].  ''[http://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf The Market for Liberty]'' (San Francisco: Fox &amp; Wilkes, 1993), p. 41.  Originally published 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tannehills, however, maintain that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market.  They write on page 81 that &quot;A private defense service company, competing in an open market, couldn’t use force to hold onto its customers—if it tried to compel people to deal with it, it would compel them to buy protection from its competitors and drive itself out of business.  The only way a private defense service company can make money is by protecting its customers from aggression, and the [[profit motive]] guarantees that this will be its only function and that it will perform this function well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda &amp; Morris Tannehill]].  ''[http://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf The Market for Liberty]'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  They go on to write: &lt;blockquote&gt;Private defense service employees would not have the legal immunity which so often protects governmental policemen.  If they committed an aggressive act, they would have to pay for it, just the same as would any other individual.  A defense service detective who beat a suspect up wouldn’t be able to hide behind a government uniform or take refuge in a position of superior political power.  Defense service companies would be no more immune from having to pay for acts of initiated force and fraud than would bakers or shotgun manufacturers. ... Because of this, managers of defense service companies would quickly fire any employee who showed any tendency to initiate force against anyone, including prisoners.  To keep such an employee would be too dangerously expensive for them.  A job with a defense agency wouldn’t be a position of power over others, as a police force job is, so it wouldn't attract the kind of people who enjoy wielding power over others, as a police job does.  In fact, a defense agency would be the worst and most dangerous possible place for sadists!

Government police can afford to be brutal—they have immunity from prosecution in all but the most flagrant cases, and their “customers” can’t desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency.  But for a free-market defense service company to be guilty of brutality would be disastrous.  Force—even retaliatory force—would always be used only as a last resort; it would never be used first, as it is by governmental police.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda &amp; Morris Tannehill]].  ''[http://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf The Market for Liberty]'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, critics like [[Randall G. Holcombe]] point out that PDAs much like cartels such as [[OPEC]] and international mafia groups such as [[Cosa Nostra]], would eventually engage in  the same business model in order to maximize profit. Holcombe, in an essay titled ''Is Government Inevitable?'', argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holcombe states that &quot;the [[mafia]] offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minarchist critics argue that, if monopolies of force are inevitable, community-controlled monopolies are preferable to privately controlled ones. Anarchist critics of private defense agencies state that community militias should exist alongside or instead of private defense agencies. Other critics, both anarchist and minarchist, argue that formal police forces, whether community controlled or privately controlled, have institutional flaws which informal defense arrangements do not.&lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, Errico, 1921, in a letter to Venturini.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarcho-capitalism and other anarchist schools===
{{Main|Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism}}
[[Anarcho-capitalism#Sources that do not consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism|Some scholars]] do not consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism, while [[Anarcho-capitalism#Sources that consider anarcho-capitalism a form of anarchism|others]] do. Some communist anarchists argue that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism due to their understanding of capitalism as inherently authoritarian. In particular they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary, and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which is incompatible with an anarchist society. Moreover, capitalistic market activity is essentially dependent on private ownership and a particular form of exchange of goods, selling and buying.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

On the other hand, anarcho-capitalists such as Per Bylund, webmaster of the [[anarchism without adjectives]] website ''[[anarchism.net]]'', note that the disconnect among non-anarcho-capitalist anarchists is likely the result of an &quot;unfortunate situation of fundamental misinterpretation of anarcho-capitalism.&quot;  Bylund asks, &quot;How can one from this historical heritage claim to be both anarchist and advocate of the exploitative system of capitalism?&quot; and answers it by pointing out that &quot;''no one can'', and ''no one does''. There are no anarchists approving of such a system, even anarcho-capitalists (for the most part) do not.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bylund&quot;&gt;Bylund, Per. [http://anarchism.net/anarchism_anarchismcapitalismandanarchocapitalism.htm Anarchism, Capitalism, and Anarcho-Capitalism], anarchism.net.  July 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bylund explains this as follows:
{{Block quote|Capitalism in the sense of wealth accumulation as a result of oppressive and exploitative wage slavery must be abandoned. The enormous differences between the wealthy and the poor do not only cause tensions in society or personal harm to those exploited, but is essentially unjust. Most, if not all, property of today is generated and amassed through the use of force. This cannot be accepted, and no anarchists accept this state of inequality and injustice.

As a matter of fact, anarcho-capitalists share this view with other anarchists. Murray N. Rothbard, one of the great philosophers of anarcho-capitalism, used a lot of time and effort to define legitimate property and the generation of value, based upon a notion of “natural rights” (see Murray N. Rothbard’s ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]''). The starting point of Rothbard’s argumentation is every man’s sovereign and full right to himself and his labor. This is the position of property creation shared by both socialists and classical liberals, and is also the shared position of anarchists of different colors. Even the statist capitalist libertarian [[Robert Nozick]] wrote that contemporary property was unjustly accrued and that a free society, to him a “minimalist state,” needs to make up with this injustice (see Robert Nozick’s “[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]”).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Thus it seems anarcho-capitalists agree with Proudhon in that “[[property is theft]],” where it is acquired in an illegitimate manner. But they also agree with Proudhon in that “property is liberty” (See Albert Meltzer’s short analysis of Proudhon’s “property is liberty” in Anarchism: Arguments For and Against, p. 12-13) in the sense that without property, i.e. being robbed of the fruits of one’s actions, one is a slave. Anarcho-capitalists thus advocate the freedom of a stateless society, where each individual has the sovereign right to his body and labor and through this right can pursue his or her own definition of happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;bylund&quot;/&gt;}}

Murray N. Rothbard notes that the capitalist system of today is, indeed, not properly anarchistic because it is so often in collusion with the state.  According to Rothbard, &quot;what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fpc&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray N.  [http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559|A Future of Peace and Capitalism], James H. Weaver, ed., ''Modern Political Economy'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1973), pp. 419–430&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism,&quot; writes Rothbard, &quot;is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation.&quot;  He goes on to point out that he is &quot;very optimistic about the future of free-market capitalism.  I’m ''not'' optimistic about the future of state capitalism—or rather, I ''am'' optimistic, because I think it will eventually come to an end.  State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fpc&quot;/&gt;

Murray Rothbard maintains that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N.  [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard].  ''The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal''. 25 February 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality, as, he argues, any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology (redistribution of private property, ''etc.''). In short, while granting that certain non-coercive hierarchies will exist under an anarcho-capitalist system, they will have no real authority except over their ''own'' property: a worker existing within such a 'hierarchy' (answerable to management, bosses, ''etc.'') is free at all times to abandon this voluntary 'hierarchy' and 1) create an organization within which he/she is at (or somewhere near) the top of the 'hierarchy' (entrepreneurship), 2) join an existing 'hierarchy' (wherein he/she will likely be lower in the scheme of things), or 3) abandon these hierarchies altogether and join/form a non-hierarchical association such as a cooperative, commune, ''etc.''. Since there will be no taxes, such cooperative organizations (labour unions, communes, voluntary socialist associations wherein the product of the labour and of the capital goods of those who join which they were able to peaceably acquire would be shared amongst all who joined, ''etc.'') would, under anarcho-capitalism, enjoy the freedom to do as they please (provided, of course that they set up their operation on their own -or un-owned- property, in other words so long as they do so without force).

According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority, and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society: cooperatives, non-profit organizations (which would, just as today, be funded by individuals for their existence), businesses, etc. (in short, a free market does not equal the end of civil society, which continues to be a critique of anarcho-capitalism). Moreover, anarcho-capitalists (as well as classical liberal minarchists and others) argue that the application of so-called &quot;leftist&quot; anarchist ideals (''e.g.'' the forceful redistribution of wealth from one set of people to another) requires an authoritarian body of some sort that will impose this ideology. ([[Voluntaryism|Voluntaryist]] socialism, of course, is completely compatible with anarcho-capitalism.) Some also argue that human beings are motivated primarily by the fulfillment of their own needs and wants. Thus, to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital, which could result in further fulfillment of human desires, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to, in essence, exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively 'egalitarian'-anarchist system.

===Stability of anarcho-capitalist legal institutions===

Two of the more prominent academics who have given some serious thought to essentially anarcho-capitalist legal institutions are [[Richard Posner]], who is now a Federal Appeals Judge and a prolific legal scholar, and economist [[William Landes]]. In their 1975 paper &quot;The Private Enforcement of Law&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;William Landes and Richard Posner. [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;cluster=12598851504784974688 The Private Enforcement of Law] ''4 Journal of Legal Studies 1''. &lt;/ref&gt; they discuss a previous [[thought experiment]] undertaken by Becker and Stigler in which it was proposed that law enforcement could be privatized, and they explain why they believe such a system would not be economically efficient. According to [[David D. Friedman]]'s later rebuke &quot;Efficient Institutions for the Private Enforcement of Law&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;David D. Friedman. [http://daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Efficient_Inst_For_Priv_Enf/Private_Enforcement.html Efficient Institutions for the Private Enforcement of Law] also available as [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;cluster=15612883692165763455 an article on Google Scholar]''13 Journal of Legal Studies 379''. &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[Landes and Posner argued] that the private system has essential flaws that make it inferior to an ideal public system except for offenses that can be detected and punished at near zero cost. They concede that the private system might still be preferable to the less than ideal public system that we observe. However they argue that the prevalence of private enforcement for offenses that are easily detected (most civil offenses) and its rarity for offenses that are difficult to detect (most criminal offenses) suggest that our legal system is, at least in broad outline, efficient, using in each case the most efficient system of enforcement.}} Friedman, however, proceeds to argue that &quot;the inefficiency Landes and Posner have demonstrated in the particular private enforcement institutions they describe can be eliminated by minor changes in the institutions.&quot;

===Fiction===
Anarcho-capitalism has been examined in certain works of literature, particularly [[science fiction]]. An early example is [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1966 novel ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', in which he explores what he terms &quot;rational anarchism&quot;.  A contemporary anarcho-capitalistic work of [[science fiction]] is  [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]]'s ''[[The Golden Age (John C. Wright novel)|The Golden Age]]''.

In ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] the [[Discordian Society]] headed by the character [[Hagbard Celine]] is anarcho-capitalist. The manifesto of the society in the novel 'Never Whistle While You're Pissing' contains [[Celine's Laws]], three laws regarding government and social interaction.

[[Cyberpunk]] and [[postcyberpunk]] authors have been particularly fascinated by the idea of the break-down of the nation-state. Several stories of [[Vernor Vinge]], including ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' and ''[[The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge#Conquest by Default|Conquest by Default]]'' , feature anarcho-capitalist societies, sometimes portrayed in a favorable light, and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Jim|title=Reviews by Jim Henry: Vernor Vinge|url=http://jimhenry.conlang.org/review/vinge_v.htm|accessdate=Mar.17,2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', [[Max Barry]]'s ''[[Jennifer Government]]'', [[Cory Doctorow]]'s ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]],'' and [[L. Neil Smith]]'s ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' all explore anarcho-capitalist ideas. The cyberpunk portrayal of anarchy varies from the downright grim to the cheerfully optimistic, and it need not imply anything specific about the writer's political views. Neal Stephenson, in particular, refrains from sweeping political statements when deliberately provoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/36481.html |title=Neal Stephenson's Past, Present, and Future; The author of the widely praised Baroque Cycle on science, markets, and post-9/11 America. |accessdate=2007-08-11 |last=Godwin |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Godwin |coauthors=[[Neal Stephenson]] |year=2005 |month=February |format=print article |work= |publisher=Reason (magazine) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/20/1518217 |title=Neal Stephenson Responds With Wit and Humor. |accessdate=2007-08-11 |author=Roblimo |authorlink= |coauthors=Neal Stephenson |date=2004-10-20 |format=email exchange |work= |publisher=Slashdot }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken MacLeod]]'s Fall Revolution series explores the future consequences of the breakdown of current political systems within a revolutionary context. The second novel of the series ''[[The Stone Canal]]'' deals specifically with an anarcho-capitalist society and explores issues of self-ownership, privatization of police and courts of law, and the consequences of a contractual society.

In Matt Stone's (Richard D. Fuerle) novelette ''On the Steppes of Central Asia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchism.net/steppes.htm |title=On the Steppes of Central Asia |accessdate=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an American grad student is invited to work for a newspaper in Mongolia, and discovers that the Mongolian society is indeed stateless in a semi-anarcho-capitalist way. The novelette was originally written to advertise Fuerle's 1986 economics treatise ''The Pure Logic of Choice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purelogic.us/ |title=The Pure Logic of Choice |accessdate=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Neil Schulman]]'s novel ''[[Alongside Night]]'' involves the occurrence of the achievement of a market anarchist society through [[Agorism]].

[[Sandy Sandfort]]'s, [[Scott Bieser]]'s and [[Lee Oaks]]'s Webcomic ''[[Escape from Terra]]'', examines a market anarchy based on Ceres
and its interaction with the aggressive statist society on Terra. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapefromterra.com/ |title=Big Head Press - Thoughtful Stories, Graphic Novels Online And In Print - Escape From Terra - by Sandy Sandfort, Scott Bieser, Leila Del Duca and Lee Oaks! |publisher=Escape From Terra |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aristophanes''' (&lt;small&gt;English pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|r|ɨ|ˈ|s|t|ɒ|f|ə|n|iː|z|}}; {{IPA-el|aristopʰánɛːs|anc}}; {{Unicode|Ἀριστοφάνης}}, ca. 446 BC – ca. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the [[deme]] Cydathenaus,&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' Alan Sommerstein, Penguin Books 1973, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; was a prolific and much acclaimed [[comedy|comic]] [[playwright]] of [[Classical Athens|ancient Athens]]. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as [[Ancient Greek comedy|Old Comedy]], and they are in fact used to define the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J.Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page X.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as ''the Father of Comedy''&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes in Performance 421 BC-AD 2007:Peace, Birds and Frogs'' Edith Hall and Amanda Wrigley, Legenda (Oxford) 2007, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and ''the Prince of Ancient Comedy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://manybooks.net/support/b/brewere/brewere1143111431-8.exp.html Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birds and Other plays'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries {{emdash}} [[Plato]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Apology'' translated by Benjamin Jowett, [[s:Apology (Plato)#4|section 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apology, Greek text, edited J. Burnet, [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1_%CE%A3%CF%89%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82 section 19c]&lt;/ref&gt; singled out Aristophanes' play ''[[The Clouds]]'' as slander contributing to the trial and execution of [[Socrates]] although other [[Socrates#Satirical playwrights|satirical playwrights]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' Alan Sommerstein, Penguin Books 1973, p16&lt;/ref&gt; had also caricatured the philosopher. His second play, ''The Babylonians'' (now lost), was denounced by the demagogue [[Cleon]] as a slander against the Athenian [[polis]]. It is possible that the case was argued in court but details of the trial are not recorded and Aristophanes caricatured Cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays, especially ''[[The Knights]]'', the first of many plays that he directed himself. &quot;In my opinion,&quot; he says through the Chorus in that play, &quot;the author-director of comedies has the hardest job of all.&quot; ({{Polytonic|κωμῳδοδιδασκαλίαν εῖναι χαλεπώτατον ἔργον ἁπάντων}})&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Knights ln 516&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Ehrentribuene Dionysostheater Athen.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Theatre of Dionysus]], Athens - in Aristophanes' time, the [[audience]] probably sat on wooden benches with earth foundations.&lt;ref&gt;''Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Less is known about Aristophanes than about his plays. In fact, his plays are the main source of information about him. It was conventional in Old Comedy for the Chorus to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the '[[Aristophanes#Parabasis|parabasis]]' and thus some biographical facts can be got 'straight from the horse's mouth', so to speak. However, these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life.&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Comedy and Ideology'' David Konstan, Oxford University Press US 1995, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was a comic ''poet'' in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of 'teacher' (didaskalos), and though this specifically referred to his training of the Chorus in rehearsal, it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Clouds'' K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes claimed to be writing for a clever and discerning audience,&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts,''Clouds'' 520-25&lt;/ref&gt; yet he also declared that 'other times' would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts,''Clouds'' 560-62&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes boasts of his originality as a dramatist&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'' 1536-7 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek], ''Clouds'' 545-48, ''Peace'' 739-58&lt;/ref&gt; yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in Athenian society. He caricatured leading figures in the arts (notably [[Euripides]], whose influence on his own work however he once begrudgingly acknowledged),&lt;ref&gt;''The Birds and Other Plays by Aristophanes'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 2003, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; in politics (especially the populist [[Cleon]]), and in philosophy/religion (where Socrates was the most obvious target). Such caricatures seem to imply that Aristophanes was an old-fashioned conservative, yet that view of him leads to contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Society'' Antony Andrewes, Pelican Books, 1981, pages 247-48&lt;/ref&gt;  

The writing of plays was a craft that could be handed down from father to son, and it has been argued that Aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A.H. Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1975, page9, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; The plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens, the [[Lenaia]] and [[City Dionysia]], where they were judged and awarded places relative to the works of other comic dramatists. An elaborate series of lotteries, designed to prevent prejudice and corruption, reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five in number. These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; They were certainly huge, with seating for at least 10 000 at the Theatre of Dionysus, but it is not certain that they were a representative sample of the Athenian citizenry. The day's program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded, with three tragedies and a 'satyr' play ahead of the comedy, and it is possible that many of the poorer citizens (typically the main supporters of demagogues like Cleon) occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits. (Those inhabitants who were not citizens, such as slaves, were also excluded from the audience.) The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of a dominant group in an unrepresentative audience. The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays. Throughout most of Aristophanes' career, the Chorus was essential to a play's success and it was recruited and funded by a ''choregus'', a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the [[archon]]s. A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour, but Aristophanes showed in ''[[The Knights]]'' that wealthy citizens could regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''The Knights'' lines 911-25&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the political conservatism of the plays might reflect the views of the wealthiest section of society, on whose generosity comic dramatists depended for the success of their plays.&lt;ref&gt;W.Rennie, ''The Acharnians of Aristophanes'', Edward Arnold (London, 1909), page 7, reproduced by Bibliolife&lt;/ref&gt;

When Aristophanes' first play ''The Banqueters'' was produced, Athens was an ambitious, imperial power and [[The Peloponnesian War]] was only in its fourth year. His plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation (the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Battle of Marathon|victors at Marathon]])&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'' 1075-1101 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek], ''Knights'' 565-576&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource Greek text] 692-700&lt;/ref&gt; yet they are not jingoistic and they are staunchly opposed to the war with Sparta. The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers, among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently.&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'' 669-677 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek]; ''Knights'' 438-39, 833-35, 864-67; ''Peace'' 1210-64; ''Birds'' 1410-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'', Wikisource [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 lines 910-58]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time his last play was produced (around 386 BC) Athens had been defeated in war, its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from the political to the intellectual centre of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A.H.Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1975, pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period - the structure of his plays evolves from Old Comedy until, in his last surviving play, [[Plutus (play)|''Wealth II'']], it more closely resembles New Comedy. However it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Aristophanes won second prize at the [[City Dionysia]] in 427 BC with his first play ''The Banqueters'' (now lost). He won first prize there with his next play, ''The Babylonians'' (also now lost). It was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the City Dionysia ,and ''The Babylonians'' caused some embarrassment for the Athenian authorities since it depicted the cities of the Athenian League as slaves grinding at a mill.&lt;ref&gt;'Greek Drama' P.Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' J.Boardman, J.Griffin, O.Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 177&lt;/ref&gt; Some influential citizens, notably [[Cleon]], reviled the play as slander against the ''[[polis]]'' and possibly took legal action against the author. The details of the trial are unrecorded but, speaking through the hero of his third play ''[[The Acharnians]]'' (staged at the [[Lenaia]], where there were few or no foreign dignitaries), the poet carefully distinguishes between the ''polis'' and the real targets of his acerbic wit:

{{Polytonic|
::ἡμῶν γὰρ ἄνδρες, κοὐχὶ τὴν πόλιν λέγω,
::μέμνησθε τοῦθ᾽ ὅτι οὐχὶ τὴν πόλιν λέγω,
::ἀλλ᾽ ἀνδράρια μοχθηρά, παρακεκομμένα...}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'', Wikisource [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82#κ|515 lines 515-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

::People among us, and I don't mean the polis,
::Remember this - I don't mean the polis -
::But wicked little men of a counterfeit kind....

Aristophanes repeatedly savages Cleon in his later plays. But these satirical diatribes appear to have had no effect on Cleon's political career - a few weeks after the performance of ''The Knights'', a play full of anti-Cleon jokes, Cleon was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birds and Other Plays by Aristophanes'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Cleon also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Aristophanes: the caricatures of him continued up to and even beyond his death.

In the absence of clear biographical facts about Aristophanes, scholars make educated guesses based on interpretation of the language in the plays. [[Inscriptiones Graecae|Inscriptions]] and summaries or comments by Hellenistic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues. We know however from a combination of these sources,&lt;ref&gt;D.Welsh, ''IG ii&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2343, Philonides and Aristophanes' Banqueters'', Classical Quarterly 33 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; and especially from comments in ''The Knights''&lt;ref&gt;''Knights 512-14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Clouds'',&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' 530-33&lt;/ref&gt; that Aristophanes' first three plays were not directed by him - they were instead directed by Callistratus and Philoneides,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Storey, General Introduction, in ''Clouds, Wasps, Birds By Aristophanes'', Peter Meineck (translator), Hackett Publishing 1998, page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; an arrangement that seemed to suit Aristophanes since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well (Philoneides for example later directed ''The Frogs'' and he was also credited, perhaps wrongly, with directing ''The Wasps''.)&lt;ref&gt;Douglas MacDowell, ''Aristophanes Wasps'', Oxford University Press (1971), n.32 page 124&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes's use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information since apparent self-references might have been made on behalf of his directors instead. Thus for example a statement by the chorus in ''The Acharnians''&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek] lines 652-54&lt;/ref&gt; seems to indicate that the 'poet' had a close, personal association with the island of [[Aegina]], yet the terms 'poet' (''poietes'') and 'director' (''didaskalos'') are often interchangeable since dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Aristophanes or Callistratus. Similarly, the hero in ''The Acharnians'' complains about Cleon &quot;dragging me into court&quot; over &quot;last year's play&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek] 377-82&lt;/ref&gt; but here again it is not clear if this was said on behalf of Aristophanes or Callistratus, either of whom might have been prosecuted by Cleon.&lt;ref&gt;W.Rennie, ''The Acharnians of Aristophanes'', Edward Arnold (London, 1909), page 12-15, reproduced by Bibliolife&lt;/ref&gt;  

Comments made by the Chorus on behalf of Aristophanes in ''[[The Clouds]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''The Clouds'' lines 528-32&lt;/ref&gt; have been interpreted as evidence that he can have been hardly more than 18 years old when his first play ''The Banqueters'' was produced.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' Alan Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Classics 1975, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The second parabasis in ''Wasps''&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek] lines 1265-91&lt;/ref&gt; appears to indicate that he reached some kind of temporary accommodation with Cleon following either the controversy over ''The Babylonians'' or a subsequent controversy over ''The Knights''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 299&lt;/ref&gt; It has been inferred&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Books 1964, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; from statements in ''The Clouds'' and ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'' that Aristophanes was prematurely bald.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Clouds'' 540-45, ''Peace'' 767-74&lt;/ref&gt;    

We know that Aristophanes was probably victorious at least once at the City Dionysia (with ''Babylonians'' in 427)&lt;ref&gt;[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main?url=oi%3Fikey%3D4561%26bookid%3D5%26region%3D1 2325]. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and at least three times at the Lenaia, with ''Acharnians'' in 425, ''Knights'' in 424, and ''Frogs'' in 405. ''Frogs'' in fact won the unique distinction of a repeat performance at a subsequent festival. We know that a son of Aristophanes, Araros, was also a comic poet and he could have been heavily involved in the production of his father's play ''[[Plutus (play)|Wealth II]]'' in 388.&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, testimonium 1, lines 54-56, in Kassel-Austin, ''Poetae Comici Graeci'' vol. III.2 (Berlin 1984), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Araros is also thought to have been responsible for the posthumous performances of the now lost plays ''Aeolosicon II'' and ''Cocalus'',&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''Κώκαλος'', testimonium iii, in Kassel-Austin, ''Poetae Comici Graeci'' vol. III.2 (Berlin 1984), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that the last of these won the prize at the City Dionysia in 387.&lt;ref&gt;IG II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main?url=oi%3Fikey%3D4558%26bookid%3D5%26region%3D1 2318]. 196&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that a second son, Philippus, was twice victorious at the Lenaia&lt;ref&gt;IG II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2325. 140&lt;/ref&gt; and he could have directed some of [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]]’ comedies.&lt;ref&gt;Eubulus, testimonium 4, in Kassel-Austin, ''Poetae Comici Graeci'' vol. V (Berlin 1986), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; A third son was called either Nicostratus or Philetaerus,&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page XVIII&lt;/ref&gt; and a man by the latter name appears in the catalogue of Lenaia victors with two victories, the first probably in the late 370s.&lt;ref&gt;IG II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2325. 143 (just after Anaxandrides and just before Eubulus)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Plato's ''[[The Symposium]]'' appears to be a useful source of biographical information about Aristophanes, but its reliability is open to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Clouds'' K.J.Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page IX note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It purports to be a record of conversations at a dinner party at which both Aristophanes and Socrates are guests, held some seven years after the performance of ''The Clouds'', the play in which Socrates was cruelly caricatured. One of the guests, [[Alcibiades]], even quotes from the play when teasing Socrates over his appearance&lt;ref&gt;''Symposium'' 221B; ''Plato'' Vol.3, Loeb Classical Library (1975), page 236&lt;/ref&gt; and yet there is no indication of any ill-feeling between Socrates and Aristophanes. Plato's Aristophanes is in fact a genial character and this has been interpreted as evidence of Plato's own friendship with him&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' Alan Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1973, page10&lt;/ref&gt; (their friendship appears to be corroborated by an epitaph for Aristophanes, ''reputedly'' written by Plato, in which the playwright's soul is compared to an eternal shrine for the Graces).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birds and Other Plays'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page10&lt;/ref&gt; Plato was only a boy when the events in ''The Symposium'' are supposed to have occurred and it is possible that his Aristophanes is in fact based on a reading of the plays. For example, conversation among the guests turns to the subject of Love and Aristophanes explains his notion of it in terms of an amusing allegory, a device he often uses in his plays. He is represented as suffering an attack of hiccoughs and this might be a humorous reference to the crude physical jokes in his plays. He tells the other guests that he is quite happy to be thought amusing but he is wary of appearing ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;''The Symposium'' original Greek text:[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%80%CF%8C%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD section 189b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Symposium'' (English translation)  [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/symposium.html Benjamin Jowett] (scroll half way down).&lt;/ref&gt; This fear of being ridiculed is consistent with his declaration in ''The Knights'' that he embarked on a career of comic playwright warily after witnessing the public contempt and ridicule that other dramatists had incurred.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), ''Knights'' ln 507-550&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Aristophanes survived [[The Peloponnesian War]], two oligarchic revolutions and two democratic restorations; this has been interpreted as evidence that he was not actively involved in politics despite his highly political plays.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Introduction page IX&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably appointed to the Council of Five Hundred for a year at the beginning of the fourth century but such appointments were very common in democratic Athens.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Birds and Other Plays'' D. Barrett and A. Sommerstein (eds),Penguin Classics 2003, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates, in the trial leading up to his own death, put the issue of a personal conscience in those troubled times quite succinctly: 
:{{Polytonic|ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστι τὸν τῷ ὄντι μαχούμενον ὑπὲρ τοῦ δικαίου, καὶ εἰ μέλλει ὀλίγον χρόνον σωθήσεσθαι, ἰδιωτεύειν ἀλλὰ μὴ δημοσιεύειν.}}&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource, Plato's ''Apology'', John Burnet (ed) [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1_%CE%A3%CF%89%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82 section 32a]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&quot;...he who will really fight for the right, if he would live even for a little while, must have a private station and not a public one.&lt;ref&gt;Plato's ''Apology'', Benjamin Jowett (trans) [[s:Apology (Plato)#23|section 23]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristophanes the Poet==
[[File:Muse reading Louvre CA2220.jpg|thumb|200px|Muse reading, Louvre]]
The language in Aristophanes' plays, and in Old Comedy generally, was valued by ancient commentators as a model of the [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]]. The orator [[Quintilian]] believed that the charm and grandeur of the Attic dialect made Old Comedy an example for orators to study and follow, and he considered it inferior in these respects only to the works of Homer.&lt;ref name=&quot;orators&quot;&gt;''The Orator's Training'' Quintilian 10.1.65-6, cited in ''The Birds and Other Plays by Aristophanes'' David Barrett and Alan Sommersteinn (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 10.1.65-6 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.61 10.1.61]&lt;/ref&gt; A revival of interest in the Attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of Aristophanes' plays during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, resulting in their survival today.&lt;ref name=&quot;orators&quot; /&gt; In Aristophanes' plays, the Attic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualities.

For Aristophanes' contemporaries the works of Homer and Hesiod were as instructive as the Bible became for many Greeks in the Christian era. Thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satire.&lt;ref&gt;''The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, pages 151-52&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references to other poets. These include not only rival comic dramatists such as Eupolis and Hermippus&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Clouds'' lines 553-54&lt;/ref&gt; and predecessors such as Magnes, Crates and Cratinus,&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Knights'' lines 519-40&lt;/ref&gt; but also tragedians, notably Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, all three of whom are mentioned in e.g. ''The Frogs''. Aristophanes was the equal of these great tragedians in his subtle use of lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of Euripides in particular, so much so that the comic dramatist Cratinus labelled him a 'Euripidaristophanist' addicted to hair-splitting niceties.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birds and Other Plays by Aristophanes'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  

A full appreciation of Aristophanes' plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill, and of their different rhythms and associations.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; There were three broad poetic forms: iambic dialogue, tetrameter verses and lyrics:&lt;ref&gt;''Birds and Other Plays'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, pages 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Iambic dialogue''': Aristophanes achieves an effect resembling natural speech through the use of the [[iambic hexameter]] (corresponding to the effects achieved by English poets such as Shakespeare using iambic pentameters). His realistic use of the metre&lt;ref&gt;''Birds and Other Plays'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 27; ''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; makes it ideal for both dialogue and soliloquy, as for instance in the prologue, before the arrival of the Chorus, when the audience is introduced to the main issues in the plot. ''The Acharnians'' opens with these three lines by the hero, Dikaiopolis (rendered here in English as iambic pentameters):

::How many are the things that vex my heart!
::Pleasures are few, so very few - just four -
::But stressful things are manysandthousandsandheaps!&lt;ref&gt;Original Greek, Wikisource ''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 lines 1-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Here Aristophanes employs a frequent device, arranging the syntax so that the final word in a line comes as a comic climax.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page17&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's pleasures are so few he can number them ({{Polytonic|τέτταρα}}, four) but his causes for complaint are so many they beggar numerical description and he must invent his own word for them ({{Polytonic|ψαμμακοσιογάργαρα}}, literally 'sandhundredheaps', here paraphrased 'manysandthousandsandheaps'). The use of invented compound words is another comic device frequently found in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page13; ''Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' Alan Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Tetrameter catalectic verses''': These are long lines of anapests, trochees or iambs (where each line is ideally measured in four ''dipodes'' or pairs of feet), used in various situations within each play such as:
**formal debates or ''agons'' between characters (typically in anapestic rhythm);
**excited dialogue or heated argument (typically trochaic rhythm, the same as in early tragedy);
**long speeches declaimed by the Chorus in [[Aristophanes#Parabasis|parabases]] (in either anapestic or trochaic rhythms);
**informal debates barely above the level of ordinary dialogue (typically iambic).
:Anapestic rhythms are naturally jaunty (as in many [[limericks]]) and trochaic metre is suited to rapid delivery (the word 'trochee' is in fact derived from ''trechein'', 'to run', as demonstrated for example by choruses who enter at speed, often in aggressive mood)&lt;ref&gt;L.P.E. Parker, ''The Songs of Aristophanes'', Oxford, 1997, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though both these rhythms can seem to 'bowl along'&lt;ref name=&quot;Other Plays' 2003, page 27&quot;&gt;''Birds and Other Plays'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted metres, adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument. In an anapestic passage in ''The Frogs'', for instance, the character Aeschylus presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god, Dionysus:

::'''AES.''':It was Orpheus singing who taught us religion and how wrong people are when they kill,
::And we learned from Musaeus medicinal cures and the science of divination.
::If it's farming you want, Hesiod knows it all, when to plant, when to harvest. How godlike
::Homer got to be famous, I'll tell if you ask: he taught us what all good men should know,
::Discipline, fortitude, battle-readiness. '''DIO.''': But no-one taught Pantocles - yesterday
::He was marching his men up and down on parade when the crest of his helmet fell off!&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 2, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Frogs'' lines 1032-38&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhythm begins at a typical anapestic gallop, slows down to consider the revered poets Hesiod and Homer, then gallops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate Pantocles. Such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays, allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audience's appetite for the next joke.

*'''Lyrics''': Almost nothing is known about the music that accompanied Greek lyrics, and the metre is often so varied and complex that it is difficult for modern readers or audiences to get a feel for the intended effects, yet Aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity of his lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Other Plays' 2003, page 27&quot;/&gt; Some of the most memorable and haunting lyrics are dignified hymns set free of the comic action&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Drama'', Peter Levi, in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' edited by J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray, Oxford University Press 1986, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; In the example below, taken from ''The Wasps'', the lyric is merely a comic interlude and the rhythm is steadily trochaic. The syntax in the original Greek is natural and unforced and it was probably accompanied by brisk and cheerful music, gliding to a concluding pun at the expense of Amynias, who is thought to have lost his fortune gambling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell 1978, page 27&quot;&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

::Though to myself I often seem
:::A bright chap and not awkward,
::None comes close to Amynias,
:::Son of Sellos of the Bigwig
::Clan, a man I once saw
:::Dine with rich Leogorus.
::Now as poor as Antiphon,
:::He lives on apples and pomegranates
::Yet he got himself appointed
:::Ambassador to Pharselus,
::Way up there in Thessaly,
:::Home of the poor Penestes:
::Happy to be where everyone
:::Is as penniless as he is!&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, Wikisource: [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 lines 1265-74]&lt;/ref&gt;

:The pun here in English translation (''Penestes''-''penniless'') is a weak version of the Greek pun {{Polytonic|Πενέσταισι-πενέστης}}, ''Penéstaisi-penéstĕs'', &quot;destitute&quot;. Many of the puns in the plays are based on words that are similar rather than identical, and it has been observed that there could be more of them than scholars have yet been able to identify.&lt;ref&gt;''Birds and Other Plays'' David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), Penguin Classics 2003, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Others are based on double meanings. Sometimes entire scenes are constructed on puns, as in ''The Acharnians'' with the Megarian farmer and his pigs:&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek] lines 729-835&lt;/ref&gt; the Megarian farmer defies the Athenian embargo against Megarian trade, and tries to trade his daughters disguised as pigs, except &quot;pig&quot; was ancient slang for &quot;vagina&quot;.  Since the embargo against [[Megara]] was the pretext for the Peloponnesian War, Aristophanes naturally concludes that this whole mess happened because of &quot;three cunts&quot;.

It can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery, particularly the use of similes, metaphors and pictorial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; In 'The Knights', for example, the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as parasols that open and close.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Knights'' lines 1347-48;&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Frogs'', [[Aeschylus]] is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sandpit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Frogs'' lines 902-4&lt;/ref&gt; Some plays feature revelations of human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious in character, such as the marriage of the hero Pisthetairos to Zeus's paramour in ''The Birds'' and the 'recreation' of old Athens, crowned with roses, at the end of ''The Knights''.

==Aristophanes and Old Comedy==
[[File:Thalia sarcophagus Louvre Ma475.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]], [[muse]] of comedy, gazing upon a comic mask (detail from ''Muses' Sarcophagus'')]]
The Greek word for 'comedy' (''kōmōidía'') derives from the words for 'revel' and 'song' (''kōmos'' and ''ōdē'') and according to Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;''The Poetics'' 1449a11, Wikisource English translation [[s:The Poetics#IV]] section IV&lt;/ref&gt; comic drama actually developed from song. The first, official comedy at the [[City Dionysia]] was not staged until 487/6 BC,&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' translated by Peter Meineck with introduction by Ian Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, page IX&lt;/ref&gt; by which time tragedy had already been long established there. The first comedy at the [[Lenaia]] was staged later still,&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' page XIX&lt;/ref&gt; only about 20 years before the performance there of ''The Acharnians'', the first of Aristophanes' surviving plays. According to Aristotle, comedy was slow to gain official acceptance because nobody took it seriously&lt;ref&gt;''The Poetics'' 1448b38 - 1449b, Wikisource English translation [[s:The Poetics#V]] section V&lt;/ref&gt; yet, only sixty years after comedy first appeared at 'The City Dionysia', Aristophanes observed that producing comedies was the most difficult work of all.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Knights'' ln 516&lt;/ref&gt; Competition at the Dionysian festivals needed dramatic conventions for plays to be judged, but it also fuelled innovations.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Developments were quite rapid and Aristotle was able to distinguish between 'old' and 'new' comedy by 330 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1128a 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; The trend from Old Comedy to New Comedy saw a move away from highly topical concerns with real individuals and local issues towards generalized situations and stock characters. This was partly due to the internationalization of cultural perspectives during and after the Peloponnesian War.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes'' D. Slavitt and P. Bovie (eds), University of Pennsylvania Press 1999, page XIV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' translated by P. Meineck with introduction by I. Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII&lt;/ref&gt; For ancient commentators such as Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;''Comparison of Aristophanes and Menander''&lt;/ref&gt;  New Comedy was a more sophisticated form of drama than Old Comedy. However Old Comedy was in fact a complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches to humour and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' translated by P.Meineck with introduction by I.Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, page VII&lt;/ref&gt; In Aristophanes' early plays, the genre appears to have developed around a complex set of dramatic conventions and these were only gradually simplified and abandoned.

The City Dionysia and the Lenaia were celebrated in honour of Dionysus, a god who represented Man's darker nature ([[Euripides]]' play [[The Bacchae]] offers the best insight into 5th Century ideas about this god).&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' P.Meineck (translator) and I.Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Old Comedy can be understood as a celebration of the exuberant sense of release inherent in his worship&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' P.Meineck (translator) and I.Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page XIX&lt;/ref&gt; It was more interested in finding targets for satire than in any kind of advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Society'' Antony Andrewes, Pelican Books 1981, page 247&lt;/ref&gt; During the City Dionysia, a statue of the god was brought to the theatre from a temple outside the city and it remained in the theatre throughout the festival, overseeing the plays like a privileged member of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A.Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Frogs'', the god appears also as a dramatic character and he enters the theatre ludicrously disguised as [[Hercules]]. He observes to the audience that every time he is on hand to hear a joke from a comic dramatist like Phrynichus (one of Aristophanes' rivals) he ages by more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;''Frogs'' Wikisource English translation [[s:The Frogs]]; original Greek text [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%B9 lines 12-18]&lt;/ref&gt; The scene opens the play and it is a reminder to the audience that nobody is above mockery in Old Comedy - not even its patron god and its practitioners! Gods, artists, politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate targets, comedy was a kind of licensed buffoonery&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Society'' Antony Andrewes, Pelican Books 1981, page 248&lt;/ref&gt; and there was no legal redress for anyone who was slandered in a play.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; There were ''some'' limits to the scope of the satire, but they are not easily defined. Impiety could be punished in 5th century Athens but absurdities implicit in traditional religion were open to ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The [[polis]] was not allowed to be slandered but, as stated in the biography section of this article, that could depend on who was in the audience and which festival was involved. 

For convenience, Old Comedy, as represented by Aristophanes' early plays, is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics - topicality, festivity and complexity. Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes' plays. However it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate section.

===Topicality===
Old Comedy's emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries - see for example articles on [[The Knights]], [[The Wasps]] and [[Peace (play)|Peace]] for lists of topical references. The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens.
  
*'''Individual masks''': All actors in [[classical Athens]] wore masks, but whereas in tragedy and New Comedy these identified stereotypical characters, in Old Comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people. Perhaps Socrates attracted a lot of attention in Old Comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Knights'' we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of Cleon (there represented as a Paphlagonian slave) but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' lines 230-33&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''The real scene of action''': Since Old Comedy makes numerous references to people in the audience, the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke. In ''The Acharnians'', for example, The [[Pnyx]] is just a few steps from the hero's front door, and in ''Peace'' Olympia is separated from Athens by a few moments' supposed flight on a dung beetle. The audience is sometimes drawn or even dragged into the action. When the hero in ''Peace'' returns to Athens from his flight to Olympia, he tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the heavens, and seen up close they look even worse.&lt;ref&gt;''Peace'' 821-23&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Acharnians'' the hero confronts the [[Archon|archon basileus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek] lines 1224-25&lt;/ref&gt; sitting in the front row, and demands to be awarded first prize for a drinking competition, which is a none too subtle way for Aristophanes to request first prize for the drama competition.
 
*'''Self-mocking theatre''': Frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of Old Comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand. But the Lenaia and City Dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies, and thus references to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audience.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek Drama&quot; Peter Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' J.Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; The comic dramatist also poked fun at comic poets and he even ridiculed himself. It is possible, as indicated earlier, that Aristophanes mocked his own baldness. In ''The Clouds'', the Chorus compares him to an unwed, young mother&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' lines 528-33&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''The Acharnians'' the Chorus mockingly depicts him as Athens' greatest weapon in the war against Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' lines 646-51&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Political theatre''': The Lenaia and City Dionysus were state-sponsored, religious festivals, and though the latter was the more prestigious of the two, both were occasions for official pomp and circumstance. The ceremonies for the Lenaia were overseen by the [[archon basileus]] and by officials of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. The City Dionysia was overseen by the [[Archon|archon eponymous]] and the priest of Dionysus. Opening ceremonies for the City Dionysia featured, in addition to the ceremonial arrival of the god, a parade in full armour of the sons of warriors who died fighting for the polis and, until the end of the Peloponnesian War, a presentation of annual tribute from subject states.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A.Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and political issues were topics that could hardly be ignored in such a setting and the plays often treat them quite seriously. Even jokes can be serious when the topic is politics - especially in wartime. The butts of the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey on the gullibility of their fellow citizens, including oracle-mongers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Knights'' lines 997-1095; ''Birds'' lines 959-91&lt;/ref&gt; the exponents of new religious practices,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Clouds'' lines 263-66, ''Frogs'' lines 891-94&lt;/ref&gt; war-profiteers and political fanatics. In ''The Acharnians'', for example, [[Lamachus]] is represented as a crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared to the hero's preparations for a dinner party.&lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' lines 1097-1142 lines&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cleon]] emerges from numerous similes and metaphors in ''The Knights'' as a protean form of comic evil, clinging to political power by every possible means for as long as he can, yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking Poseidon and Athena,&lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' lines 551-64 and 581-594&lt;/ref&gt; and it ends with visions of a miraculously transformed Demos (i.e. the morally reformed citizenry of Athens).&lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' lines 1321-38&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginative visions of a return to peaceful activities resulting from peace with Sparta,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Peace'' lines 551-97&lt;/ref&gt; and a plea for leniency for citizens suspected of complicity in an oligarchic revolt&lt;ref&gt;''Frogs'' lines 686-705&lt;/ref&gt; are other examples of a serious purpose behind the plays.

*'''Teasing and taunting''': A festival audience presented the comic dramatist with a wide range of targets, not just political or religious ones - anyone known to the audience could be mocked for any reason, such as diseases, physical deformities, ugliness, family misfortunes, bad manners, perversions, dishonesty, cowardice in battle, and clumsiness.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, pages XIII-XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, a conspicuous presence in imperial Athens, particularly at the City Dionysia, often appear in the plays comically mispronouncing Attic words - these include Spartans (''Lysistrata''), Scythians (''Thesmophoriazusae''), Persians, Boeotians and Megarians (''The Acharnians'').

===Festivity===
The Lenaia and City Dionysia were religious festivals, but they resembled a gala rather than a church service.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, page XV&lt;/ref&gt;
  
*'''Dirty jokes''': A relaxation in standards of behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and gods.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek Drama&quot; Peter Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press 1986, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; Old Comedy is rich in obscenities and the crude jokes are often very detailed, as when the Chorus in ''The Acharnians'' places a curse on Antimachus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ''The Acharnians'' Wikisource original Greek lines 1164-73]&lt;/ref&gt; a choregus accused of niggardly conduct, wishing upon him a night-time mugging as he returns home from some drunken party and envisioning him, as he stoops down to pick up a rock in the darkness, accidentally picking up a fresh turd instead. He is then envisioned hurling the turd at his attacker, missing and accidentally hitting Cratinus, a lyric poet not admired by Aristophanes.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pages 243-4, notes 69,80,81&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly funny because the curse was sung (or chanted) in choreographed style by a Chorus of 24 grown men who were otherwise known to the audience as respectable citizens.

*'''The musical extravaganza''': The Chorus was vital to the success of a play in Old Comedy long after it had lost its relevance for tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pages 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, the competition in the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between choruses.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In fact eight of Aristophanes' eleven surviving plays are named after the Chorus. In Aristophanes' time, the Chorus in tragedy was relatively small (twelve members) and its role had been reduced to that of an awkwardly placed commentator, but in Old Comedy the Chorus was large (numbering 24), it was actively involved in the plot, its entry into the action was frequently spectacular, its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes it was involved in choreographed skirmishes with the actors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Acharnians'' lines 280-301 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek]; ''Knights'' lines 247-72; ''Wasps'' lines 452-460 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 Wikisource original Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;  The expenditure on costumes, training and maintenance of a Chorus was considerable,&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps many people in the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and music.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus gradually lost its significance as New Comedy began to develop.

*'''Obvious costumes''': Consistent with the holiday spirit, much of the humour in Old Comedy is slapstick buffoonery that doesn't require the audience's careful attention, often relying on visual cues. Actors playing male roles appear to have worn tights over grotesque padding, with a prodigious, leather phallus barely concealed by a short tunic. Female characters were played by men but were easily recognized in long, saffron tunics.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the visual cues are deliberately confused for comic effect, as in ''The Frogs'', where Dionysus arrives on stage in a saffron tunic, the buskin boots of a tragic actor and a lion skin cloak that usually characterized [[Heracles]] - an absurd outfit that provokes the character Heracles (as no doubt it provoked the audience) to guffaws of helpless mirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Frogs'' lines 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''The farcical anti-climax''': The holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences. The major confrontation (''agon'') between the 'good' and 'bad' characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play. The rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes. The farcical anti-climax has been explained in a variety of ways, depending on the particular play. In ''The Wasps'', for instance, it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main character's perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Acharnians'', it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes, demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; But the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in Old Comedy&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes' Old-and-new Comedy'' Kenneth J.Reckford, UNC Press 1987, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle, the music, jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play. The celebration of the hero's victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding, thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closure.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pages 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
The development of New Comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots, a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes'' D. Slavitt and P. Bovie (eds), University of Pennsylvania Press 1999, page XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Old Comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour, even to the point of undermining the humour itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'' M.S.Silk, Oxford University Press 2002, page 418&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''Inclusive comedy''': Old Comedy provided a variety of entertainments for a diverse audience. It accommodated a serious purpose, light entertainment, hauntingly beautiful lyrics, the buffoonery of puns and invented words, obscenities, disciplined verse, wildly absurd plots and a formal, dramatic structure.

*'''Fantasy and absurdity''': Fantasy in Old Comedy is unrestricted and impossibilities are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, page XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Situations are developed logically to absurd conclusions, an approach to humour that is echoed for instance in the works of [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Eugene Ionesco]] (the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The crazy costume worn by Dionysus in ''The Frogs'' is typical of an absurd result obtained on logical grounds - he wears a woman's saffron-coloured tunic because effeminacy is an aspect of his divinity, buskin boots because he is interested in reviving the art of tragedy, and a lion skin cape because, like Heracles, his mission leads him into [[Hades]]. Absurdities develop logically from initial premises in a plot. In ''The Knights'' for instance, Cleon's corrupt service to the people of Athens is originally depicted as a household relationship in which the slave dupes his master. The introduction of a rival, who is not a member of the household, leads to an absurd shift in the metaphor, so that Cleon and his rival become [[Erastes|erastai]] competing for the affections of an [[eromenos]], hawkers of oracles competing for the attention of a credulous public, athletes in a race for approval and orators competing for the popular vote.
 
*'''The resourceful hero''': In Aristophanic comedy, the hero is an independent-minded and self-reliant individual. He has something of the ingenuity of Homer's [[Odysseus]] and much of the shrewdness of the farmer idealized in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'', subjected to corrupt leaders and unreliable neighbours. Typically he devises a complicated and highly fanciful escape from an intolerable situation.&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dikaiopolis in ''The Acharnians'' contrives a ''private'' peace treaty with the Spartans; Bdelucleon in ''The Wasps'' turns his own house into a private law court in order to keep his jury-addicted father safely at home; Trygaeus in ''Peace'' flies to Olympus on a giant dung beetle to obtain an end to the Peloponnesian War; Pisthetairus in ''Birds'' sets off to establish his own colony and becomes instead the ruler of the bird kingdom and a rival to the gods.
  
*'''The resourceful cast''': The numerous surprising developments in an Aristophanic plot, the changes in scene, and the farcical comings and goings of minor characters towards the end of a play, were managed according to theatrical convention with only three principal actors (a fourth actor, often the leader of the chorus, was permitted to deliver short speeches).&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Frogs and other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Songs and addresses to the audience by the Chorus gave the actors hardly enough time off-stage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scene.

*'''Complex structure''': The action of an Aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal, dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another. The different, structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in English translations.

===Dramatic structure===
The structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows:
:*'''prologue''' - an introductory scene with a dialogue and/or soliloquy addressed to the audience, expressed in [[iambic trimeter]] and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the play;
:*'''parodos''' - the arrival of the chorus, dancing and singing, sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors, often expressed in long lines of tetrameters;
:*'''symmetrical scenes''' - passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters, arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length; the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenes:
:**'''parabasis''' - verses through which the Chorus addresses the audience directly, firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end (see the section below [[Aristophanes#Parabasis|Parabasis]]);
:**'''agon''' - a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play, typically in anapestic tetrameter, though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior arguments;&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' D.MacDowell (ed.), Oxford University Press 1971, page 207 note 546-630&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''episodes''' - sections of dialogue in iambic trimeter, often in a succession of scenes featuring minor characters towards the end of a play;
:*'''songs''' ('strophes'/'antistrophes' or 'odes'/'antodes') - often in symmetrical pairs where each half has the same meter and number of lines as the other, used as transitions between other structural elements, or between scenes while actors change costume, and often commenting on the action;
:*'''exodus''' - the departure of the Chorus and the actors, in song and dance celebrating the hero's victory and sometimes celebrating a symbolic marriage.
The rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Acharnians'' and ''Peace'', for example, there is no formal agon whereas in ''The Clouds'' there are two agons.

====Parabasis====
The parabasis is an address to the audience by the Chorus and/or the leader of the Chorus while the actors are leaving or have left the stage. The Chorus in this role speaks sometimes out of character, as the author's mouthpiece, and sometimes in character, but very often it isn't easy to distinguish its two roles. Generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end. The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes' own understanding was less formal.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Dougles MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 261&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis. The early plays (''The Acharnians'' to ''The Birds'') are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them.
*'''kommation''': This is a brief prelude, comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors, such as {{polytonic|ἴτε χαίροντες}} (Go rejoicing!).
*'''parabasis proper''': This is a usually a defense of the author's work and it includes criticism of the audience's attitude. It is declaimed in long lines of 'anapestic tetrameters'. Aristophanes himself refers to the parabasis proper only as 'anapests'.
*'''pnigos''': Sometimes known as 'a choker', it comprises a few short lines appended to the parabasis proper as a kind of rapid patter (it has been suggested that some of the effects achieved in a pnigos can be heard in &quot;The Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song&quot;, in act 2 of Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Iolanthe'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell 1978, page 27&quot;/&gt;
*'''epirrhematic syzygies''': These are symmetrical scenes that mirror each other in meter and number of lines. They form part of the first parabasis and they often comprise the entire second parabasis. They are characterized by the following elements:
**''strophe'' or ''ode'': These are lyrics in a variety of meters, sung by the Chorus in the first parabasis as an invocation to the gods and as a comic interlude in the second parabasis.
**''epirrhema'': These are usually long lines of trochaic tetrameters. Broadly political in their significance, they were probably spoken by the leader of the Chorus in character.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, page 126&lt;/ref&gt;
**''antistrophe'' or ''antode'': These are songs that mirror the strophe/ode in meter, length and function.
**''antepirrhema''. This is another declaimed passage and it mirrors the epirrhema in meter, length and function.

[[The Wasps]] is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approach&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' Douglas M.MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, note 1283 page 298&lt;/ref&gt; and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as follows.

Textual corruption is probably the reason for the absence of the antistrophe in the second parabasis.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, pages 298-99&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there are several variations from the ideal even within the early plays. For example, the parabasis proper in ''The Clouds'' (lines 518-62) is composed in eupolidean meter rather than in anapests&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Clouds'' K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, page 119 note 518-62&lt;/ref&gt; and the second parabasis includes a kommation but it lacks strophe, antistrophe and antepirrhema (''The Clouds'' lines 1113-30). The second parabasis in ''The Acharnians'' lines 971-99&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82#970 Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered a hybrid parabasis/song (i.e. the declaimed sections are merely continuations of the strophe and antistrophe) &lt;ref&gt;''Comedy'' E.Handley in 'The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I' P.Easterling, R. MacGregor Walker Knox, E.Kenney (eds), page 360&lt;/ref&gt; and, unlike the typical parabasis, it seems to comment on actions that occur on stage during the address. An understanding of Old Comedy conventions such as the parabasis is necessary for a proper understanding of Aristophanes' plays; on the other hand, a sensitive appreciation of the plays is necessary for a proper understanding of the conventions.

==Influence and legacy==
[[File:Aristophanes Menander.jpg|thumb||200px|Aristophanes, the master of [[Ancient Greek Comedy|Old Comedy]], and [[Menander]], the master of [[New Comedy]].]]
The tragic dramatists, [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], died near the end of the Peloponnesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop, yet comedy did continue to develop after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so because, in Aristophanes, it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new age.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek Drama&quot; Peter Levi, in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, according to one ancient source (Platonius, c.9th Century AD), one of Aristophanes's last plays, ''Aioliskon'', had neither a parabasis nor any choral lyrics (making it a type of Middle Comedy), while ''Kolakos'' anticipated all the elements of New Comedy, including a rape and a recognition scene.&lt;ref&gt;E.W.Handley, 'Comedy' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P.Easterling and B.Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 400&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes seems to have had some appreciation of his formative role in the development of comedy, as indicated by his comment in ''Clouds'' that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' lines 560-62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clouds'' was awarded third (i.e. last) place after its original performance and the text that has come down to the modern age was a subsequent draft that Aristophanes intended to be read rather than acted.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, pages XXIX-XXX&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of his plays in manuscript extended their influence beyond the original audience, over whom in fact they seem to have had little or no practical influence: they did not affect the career of [[Cleon]], they failed to persuade the Athenians to pursue an honourable peace with Sparta and it is not clear that they were instrumental in the trial and execution of Socrates, whose death probably resulted from public animosity towards the philosopher's disgraced associates (such as [[Alcibiades]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K.J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, pages XIV-XV&lt;/ref&gt; exacerbated of course by his own intransigence during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Plato's ''Apology'', Benjamin Jowett (trans), Wikisource copy: [[s:Apology (Plato)#33]] (section 33)&lt;/ref&gt; The plays, in manuscript form, have been put to some surprising uses - as indicated [[Aristophanes#Aristophanes the Poet|earlier]], they were used in the study of rhetoric on the recommendation of [[Quintilian]] and by students of the Attic dialect in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries AD. It is possible that Plato sent copies of the plays to Dionysius of Syracuse so that he might learn about Athenian life and government.&lt;ref&gt;''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X&lt;/ref&gt; 

Latin translations of the plays by [[Andreas Divus]] (Venice 1528) were circulated widely throughout Europe in the Rennaissance and these were soon followed by translations and adaptations in modern languages. [[Jean Racine|Racine]], for example, drew ''Les Plaideurs'' (1668) from ''The Wasps''. [[Goethe]] (who turned to Aristophanes for a warmer and more vivid form of comedy than he could derive from readings of Terence and Plautus) adapted a short play ''Die Vögel'' from ''The Birds'' for performance in Weimar. Aristophanes has appealed to both conservatives and radicals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries - Anatoly Lunacharsky, first Commissar of Enlightenment for the USSR in 1917, declared that the ancient dramatist would have a permanent place in proletarian theatre and yet conservative, Prussian intellectuals interpreted Aristophanes as a satirical opponent of social reform.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes in Performance 421 BC-AD 2007:Peace, Birds and Frogs'' Edith Hall and Amanda Wrigley, Legenda (Oxford) 2007, pages 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-gardist stage-director [[Karolos Koun]] directed a version of ''The Birds'' under the Acropolis in 1959 that established a trend in modern Greek history of breaking taboos through the voice of Aristophanes.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Aristophanes: watchword Caution!'' by Gonda Van Steen in 'The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theatre' Marianne McDonald and J.Michael Walton (eds) , Cambridge University Press 2007, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;  

The plays have a significance that goes beyond their artistic function, as historical documents that open the window on life and politics in [[classical Athens]], in which respect they are perhaps as important as the writings of [[Thucydides]]. The artistic influence of the plays is immeasurable. They have contributed to the history of European theatre and that history in turn shapes our understanding of the plays. Thus for example the operettas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] can give us insights into Aristophanes' plays&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly the plays can give us insights into the operettas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;W.S. Gilbert: A Mid-Victorian Aristophanes&quot; in ''W.S. Gilbert: A Century of Scholarship and Commentary'', John Bush Jones (ed), New York University Press 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The plays are a source of famous sayings, such as &quot;By words the mind is winged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Birds, l.1447-8; quotation as translated in ''Macmillan Dictionary of Political Quotations&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed below is a random and very tiny sample of works influenced (more or less) by Aristophanes.

===Drama===
*1909: ''Wasps'', original Greek, '''Cambridge University''' undergraduate production, music by [[Vaughan Williams]];
*2004, July–October: [[The Frogs (musical)|''The Frogs'' (musical)]], adapted by Nathan Lane, music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], performed at '''The Vivian Beaumont Theatre''' Broadway;
*1962-2006: various plays by students and staff, '''Kings College London''', in the original Greek:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/depts/classics/play/arch/ KCL.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frogs'' 1962,1971,1988; ''Thesmophoriazusae'' 1965, 1974, 1985; ''Acharnians'' 1968, 1992, 2004; ''Clouds'' 1977, 1990; ''Birds'' 1982, 2000; ''Ecclesiazusae'' 2006; ''Peace'' 1970; ''Wasps'' 1981

*2008, May–June: ''Frogs'', adapted by David Greenspan, music by Thomas Cabaniss, performed by '''Classic Stage Company''', New York, U.S.A.

===Literature===
* The [[Romanticism|romantic]] poet, [[Percy Shelley]], wrote a comic, lyrical drama (''Swellfoot the Tyrrant'') in imitation of Aristophanes' play ''The Frogs'' after he was reminded of the Chorus in that play by a herd of pigs passing to market under the window of his lodgings in San Giuliano, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Note on Oedipus Tyrannus'' by Mrs Shelley, quoted in ''Shelley: Poetical Works'' Thomas Hutchinson (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, page 410&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aristophanes (particularly in reference to ''The Clouds'') is mentioned frequently by the character Menedemos in the [[Hellenic Traders]] series of novels by  [[Harry Turtledove|H N Turteltaub]].
* A liberal version of the comedies have been published in [[comic book]] format, initially by &quot;Agrotikes Ekdoseis&quot; during the 1990s and republished over the years by other companies. The plot was written by Tasos Apostolidis and the sketches were of George Akokalidis. The stories feature either Aristophanes narrating them, directing the play, or even [[metafiction|as a character inside one of his stories]].

===Electronic media===
* ''The Wasps'', radio play adapted by David Pountney, music by [[Vaughan Williams]], recorded 26–28 July 2005, Albert Halls, Bolten, in association with BBC, under Halle label;
* ''[[Acropolis Now (radio)|Acropolis Now]]'' is a comedy radio show for the BBC set in Ancient Greece. It features Aristophanes, Socrates and many other famous Greeks. (Not to be confused with the Australian sitcom of the same name.) Aristophanes is characterised as a celebrity playwright, and most of his plays have the title formula: ''One of Our'' [e.g] ''Slaves has an Enormous Knob'' (a reference to the exaggerated appendages worn by Greek comic actors)
* ''[[Aristophanes Against the World]]'' was a radio play by [[Martyn Wade]] and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]].  Loosely based on several of his plays, it featured [[Clive Merrison]] as Aristophanes.
* In ''[[The Odd Couple (TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'', Oscar and Felix are on ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]'', and when the password is ''bird'', Felix’s clue is Aristophanes because of his play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]''. After failing to guess it, Oscar says that the clue is ridiculous, and then when it's Oscar’s turn to give the clue on the team’s next shot, the password is ''ridiculous'' and Oscar's clue is Aristophanes, to which Felix instantly responds, &quot;Ridiculous!&quot;

===Music===
*''[[Satiric Dances for a Comedy by Aristophanes]]'' is a three-movement piece for concert band composed by [[Norman Dello Joio]]. It was commissioned in commemoration of the Bicentennial of April 19, 1775 (the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]]) by the Concord ([[Massachusetts]]) Band. The commission was funded by the Town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] and assistance was given by the Eastern National Park and Monument Association in cooperation with the [[National Park Service]].

'''Albert Schweitzer''' (14 January 1875&amp;nbsp;– 4 September 1965) was a German ([[Alsace|Alsatian]]) [[theology|theologian]], [[organist]], [[philosopher]], [[physician]], and medical missionary. He was born in [[Kaysersberg]] in the province of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], in the [[German Empire]]. Schweitzer, a [[Lutheran]],  challenged both the secular view of [[historical Jesus|Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology]] current at his time in certain academic circles, as well as the traditional Christian view. He depicted Jesus as one who literally believed the end of the world was coming in his own lifetime and believed himself to be a world savior. He received the 1952 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his philosophy of &quot;[[Reverence for Life]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/press.html Nobel Peace Prize 1952&amp;nbsp;— Presentation Speech]&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the [[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]] in [[Lambaréné]], now in [[Gabon]], west central Africa (then French Equatorial Africa). As a music scholar and organist, he studied the music of German composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and influenced the [[Organ reform movement]] (''Orgelbewegung'').

Schweitzer's passionate quest was to discover a universal ethical philosophy, anchored in a universal reality, and make it directly available to all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meaning.ca/living/worthy_lives/WLschweitzer.htm |title=Albert Schweitzer |accessdate=12 January 2007 |date=5 January 2007 |work=Worthy Lives | publisher =International Network on Personal Meaning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is reflected in some of his sayings, such as:
{{quote |&quot;Until he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not himself find peace.&quot;}}
{{quote |&quot;I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I do know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[Image:KaysersbergAS.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Albert Schweitzer's birthplace, Kaysersberg.]]
Born in Kaysersberg, Schweitzer spent his childhood in the village of [[Gunsbach]], [[Alsace]] ({{lang-de|Günsbach}}), where his father, the local [[Lutheran|Lutheran-Evangelical]] pastor, taught him how to play music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweitzer.org/dutch/asstamm.htm Family tree]&lt;/ref&gt; Long disputed, the predominantly German-speaking region of Alsace or Elsaß was annexed by Germany in 1871; after World War I, it was reintegrated into France. The tiny village is home to the [[Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer]] (AIAS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweitzer.org/ Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer]&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval parish church of Gunsbach was of a special Protestant-Catholic kind found in various places in Germany even today. It was shared by the two congregations, which held their prayers in different areas of the same church at different times on Sundays. This compromise arose after the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years War]]. Schweitzer, the pastor's son, grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance, and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;G. Seaver, ''Albert Schweitzer&amp;nbsp;— The Man and his Mind'' (A. &amp; C. Black, London 1951), 3-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schweitzer's home language was an [[Alsatian dialect]] of German. At [[Mulhouse]] high school he got his &quot;[[Abitur]]&quot; (the certificate at the end of [[secondary education]]), in 1893. He studied organ there from 1885-1893 with Eugène Munch, organist of the Protestant Temple, who inspired Schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of German composer [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Eugene Munch'' (J. Brinkmann, Mulhouse 1898).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he played for the [[French people|French]] [[organist]] [[Charles-Marie Widor]] (at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]]), for whom Johann Sebastian Bach's organ-music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor, deeply impressed, agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee, and a great and influential friendship was begun.&lt;ref&gt;''Music in the Life of Albert Schweitzer'', edited by Charles R. Joy (London, A. &amp; C. Black 1953), 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1893 he studied [[Protestant]] [[theology]] at the [[University of Straßburg|Kaiser Wilhelm Universität]] of [[Straßburg]]. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal, and associated closely with Ernest Munch (the brother of his former teacher), organist of St William church, who was also a passionate admirer of J.S. Bach's music.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Schweitzer did his one year's obligatory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner at Straßburg (under [[Otto Lohse]]), and in 1896 he pulled together the funds to visit [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]] to see Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal (opera)|Parsifal]]'', and was deeply affected. Soon afterwards he visited the new organ in the Liederhalle at [[Stuttgart]], and, appalled by its lack of clarity, experienced another great realization. In 1898 he went back to Paris to write a [[Ph.D.]] dissertation on ''The Religious Philosophy of [[Kant]]'' at the [[Sorbonne]], and to study in earnest with Widor. Here he often met with the elderly [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll]]. He also studied piano at that time with [[Marie Jaëll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=UC5sXn1CwT4C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=schweitzer+jaell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vY7j6OQFQT&amp;sig=dNk2Uo9ESDrQ8p9Bv9vIgp9ieSs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA24,M1 George N. Marshall, David Poling, ''Schweitzer'']&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his theology degree in 1899 and published his Ph.D. at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Joy 1953, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist, dedicated also to the rescue, restoration and study of historic [[pipe organ]]s. With theological insight, he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in [[J. S. Bach]]'s religious music. In 1899 he astonished Widor by explaining figures and motifs in Bach's Chorale Preludes as painter-like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based. They were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas, conceived visually. (Widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old [[Lutheran]] hymns.)&lt;ref name = &quot;tkrsmy&quot;&gt;Seaver 1951, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exposition of these ideas, encouraged by Widor and Munch, became Schweitzer's next task, and appeared in the masterly study ''J. S. Bach: Le Musicien-Poète'', written in French and published in 1905. During its preparation he became a friend of [[Cosima Wagner]] (then in Strasbourg), with whom he had many theological and musical conversations, exploring his view of Bach's descriptive music, and playing the major Chorale Preludes for her at the Temple Neuf.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, in C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, 53-57.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a great demand for a German edition, but instead he rewrote it&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, ''My Life and Thought'', pp 80-81; cf. Seaver 1951, 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt; in two volumes (''J. S. Bach'') in German, which were published in 1908, and in an English translation by [[Ernest Newman]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, 58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Schweitzer's interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of Bach's music. He became a welcome guest at the Wagner's home, [[Wahnfried]].&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, 53-57, quoting from and translating A. Schweitzer, 'Mes Souvenirs sur Cosima Wagner', in ''L'Alsace Française'', XXXV no. 7 (12 February 1933), p. 124 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eglise St Thomas - Orgue de Choeur.JPG|thumb|left|175jpg|The Choir Organ at [[Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg)|St Thomas's Church, Strasbourg]], designed in 1905 on principles defined by Albert Schweitzer.]]
His pamphlet &quot;The Art of Organ Building and Organ Playing in Germany and France&quot; (1906,&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, 127-129, 129-165: cf. also Seaver 1951, 29-36.&lt;/ref&gt; republished with an appendix on the state of the organ-building industry in 1927) effectively launched the 20th century ''[[Orgelbewegung]]'', which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles—although this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than Schweitzer himself had intended. In 1909 he addressed the ''Third Congress of the International Society of Music'' at [[Vienna]] on the subject. Having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several European countries, he produced a very considered report.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, 165-166: Text of 1909 Questionnaire and Report, 235-269.&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the ''International Regulations for Organ Building''. He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic [[reed pipe]]s, and with the classical Alsace [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] organ resources and baroque [[flue pipe]]s, all in registers regulated (by [[Organ stop|stops]]) to access distinct voices in [[fugue]] or [[counterpoint]] capable of combination without loss of distinctness: different voices singing together in the same music.

Schweitzer also studied piano under [[Isidor Philipp]], head of the piano department at the [[Paris Conservatory]].

In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the [[Paris Bach Society]], a choir dedicated to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at [[Barcelona]] and often travelled there for that purpose.&lt;ref name = &quot;tkrsmy&quot;/&gt; He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bach's [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#Works for organ|organ works]], with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912-14. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were to be worked on in Africa: but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver 1951, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

On departure for Lambaréné in 1913 he was presented with a [[pedal piano]], a piano with pedal attachments (to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard).&lt;ref&gt;Given by the Paris Bach Society, Seaver 1951, 63: but C. R. Joy 1953, 177, says it was given by the Paris Missionary Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Built especially for the tropics, it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to Lambaréné, packed in a zinc-lined case. At first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art, and fell out of practise: but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of Bach, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Widor]], [[César Franck]], and [[Max Reger]] systematically.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver 1951, 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; It became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on Sunday afternoons. Schweitzer's pedal piano was still in use at Lambaréné in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Joy (Ed.) 1953, Plate facing p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Donald Tovey]] dedicated his conjectural completion of Bach's ''Die Kunst der Fuge'' ([[Art of the Fugue]]) to Schweitzer.

Dr Schweitzer's recordings of organ-music, and his innovative recording technique, are described separately below.

One of his notable pupils was conductor and composer [[Hans Münch (conductor)|Hans Münch]].

==Theology==
[[Image:Strasbourg Tram.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Saint-Nicolas, Strasbourg]]
In 1899 Schweitzer became a deacon at the church Saint-Nicolas of [[Strasbourg]]. In 1900, with the completion of his licentiate in theology, he was ordained as curate, and that year he witnessed the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of [[Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg)|Saint Thomas]] (from which he had just graduated), and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent.&lt;ref&gt;He officiated at the wedding of [[Theodor Heuss]] (later the first [[President]] of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]) on 11 April 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1890s Schweitzer had formed the inner resolve that it was needful for him as a Christian to repay to the world something for the happiness which it had given to him, and he determined that he would pursue his younger interests until the age of thirty and then give himself to serving humanity, with Jesus serving as his example.

In 1906 he published ''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'' (&quot;History of Life-of-Jesus research&quot;). This book, which established his reputation, was first translated into English by [[William Montgomery (cryptographer)|William Montgomery]] and published in 1910 as ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''. Under this title the book became famous in the English-speaking world. A second German edition was published in 1913, containing theologically significant revisions and expansions: but this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;This account of the editions of this work is disputed: see talk page.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Quest'', Schweitzer reviewed all former work on the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; back to the late 18th century. He showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors, and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century's findings. He maintained that the life of [[Jesus]] must be interpreted in the light of Jesus' own convictions, which reflected late Jewish [[eschatology]]. Schweitzer, however, writes: &quot;The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah, who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God, who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schweitzer, The Quest of the Historical Jesus: First Complete Edition, trans. W. Montgomery, et al., ed. John Bowden (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2001), 478.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Schweitzer found many New Testament references to apparently show that 1st-century Christians believed literally in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the World's ending, within the lifetime of Jesus's original followers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://home.pcisys.net/~jnf/schauth/rq2.html | title = Review of &quot;The Mystery of the Kingdom of God&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that in the gospel of Mark, Jesus speaks of a &quot;tribulation&quot;, with his coming in the clouds with great power and glory&quot; (St Mark), and states when it will happen: &quot;This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled&quot; (St Matthew, 24:34) (or, &quot;... have taken place&quot; (Luke 21:32)): &quot;All these things shall come upon this generation&quot; (Matthew 23:36). &quot;There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom&quot; (Matthew 16:28) (or, &quot;...until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power&quot; (Mark 9:1); or, &quot;... till they see the kingdom of God&quot; (Luke 9:27).)

Schweitzer notes that St. Paul apparently believed in the immediacy of the &quot;Second Coming of Jesus&quot;: &quot;Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord&quot; (1 Thessalonians 4.17). St Paul spoke of the 'last times': &quot;Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:29); &quot;God... Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son&quot; (Hebrews 1:2). Similarly in St Peter: &quot;Christ.. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you&quot; (1 Peter 1:20), and &quot;But the end of all things is at hand&quot; (1 Peter 4:7). &quot;Surely I come quickly&quot; (Revelation 22:20). (Again,  note N.T.Wright, ''ibid''.)

Schweitzer writes that modern Christians of many kinds deliberately ignore the urgent message (so powerfully proclaimed by Jesus during the 1st century) of an imminent end of the world. Each new generation hopes to be the one to see the world destroyed, another world coming, and the saints governing a new earth. Schweitzer concludes that the 1st century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed [[Jesus]], is both incompatible with, and far removed from, those beliefs later made official by the Roman Emperor Constantine in 325 CE.

===Aftermath===
The publication of ''The Quest for the Historical Jesus'', effectively put a stop for decades to work on the Historical Jesus as a sub-discipline of New Testament studies. This work resumed however with the development of the so-called &quot;Second Quest&quot;, among whose notable exponents was [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s student [[Ernst Käsemann]].

Schweitzer established his reputation further as a [[New Testament]] scholar with other theological studies including ''The Psychiatric Study of Jesus'' (1911); and his two studies of the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], ''Paul and his Interpreters'', and the more complete ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'' (1930). This examined the eschatological beliefs of Paul and (through this) the message of the New Testament.

==Medicine==
At the age of 30, in 1905, he answered the call of ''&quot;The Society Of The Evangelist Missions of Paris&quot;'' who was looking for a [[medical doctor]]. However, the committee of this French Missionary Society was not ready to accept his offer, considering his Lutheran theology to be &quot;incorrect&quot;.&lt;!-- Wouldn't the fact that Schweitzer wasn't a physician be an equally likely reason? --&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Seaver 1951, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He could easily have obtained a place in a German Evangelical mission, but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the University as a student in a punishing seven-year course towards the degree of a Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labor of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.

Even in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, ''The Psychiatric Study of Jesus''. In June 1912 he married Helene Bresslau, daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian [[Harry Bresslau]].

In 1912, now armed with a medical degree, Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society's mission at [[Lambaréné]] on the [[Ogooué]] river, in what is now the [[Gabon]], in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. By concerts and other fund-raising he was ready to equip a small hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spring 1913 he and his wife set off to establish a hospital near an already existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft&lt;ref&gt;''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) upstream from the mouth of the Ogooé at [[Port Gentil]] ([[Cape Lopez]]) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambaréné.
[[Image:Bassin versant de l'Ogooué-fr.svg|thumb|right|200px|The watershed of the Ogooé occupies most of Gabon. [[Lambaréné]] is marked.]]
In the first nine months he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In addition to injuries he was often treating severe [[sandflea]] and crawcraw sores (washing with [[mercuric chloride]]), ''[[framboesia]]'' (using [[benzene|arseno-benzol]] injections), tropical [[Ulcer (dermatology)|eating sores]] (cleaning and [[potassium permanganate]]), heart disease (treated with [[digitalis|digitalin]]), tropical [[dysentery]] ([[emetine]] ([[syrup of ipecac]]) and arseno-benzol), tropical [[malaria]] ([[quinine]] and Arrhenal [[arsenic]]), [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], treated at that time with [[atoxyl]], [[leprosy]] ([[chaulmoogra]] oil), fevers,  strangulated [[hernias]] (surgery), [[necrosis]], abdominal tumours and chronic [[constipation]] and [[nicotine poisoning]], while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings, [[fetishism]] and fear of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Mbahouin]].

Mrs. Helene Schweitzer was anaesthetist for surgical operations, using [[chloroform]] and [[Papaveretum]], a synthesized [[morphine]] derivative. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet), were built like native huts, of unhewn logs, along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow, and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking [[Galoa]] ([[Mpongwe]]) who first came as a patient.&lt;ref&gt;''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapters 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War I broke out in summer of 1914, Schweitzer and his wife, Germans in a French colony, were put under supervision at Lambaréné (where work continued) by the French military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical [[anaemia]], they were taken to [[Bordeaux]] and interned first in [[Garaison]], and then from March 1918 in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]. In July 1918, after being transferred via Switzerland to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on The Philosophy of Civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922 he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in [[Oxford University]], and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, ''The Decay and Restoration of Civilization'' and ''Civilization and Ethics''. The two remaining volumes, on ''The World-View of Reverence for Life '' and a fourth on the Civilized State, were never completed.

In 1924 he returned without his wife but with an Oxford undergraduate, [[Noel Gillespie]], as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had [[salvarsan]] for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Nessmann worked with the [[French Resistance]] during the Second World War, was captured and executed by the [[Gestapo]] in [[Limoges]] in 1944. cf Guy Penaud, ''Dictionaire Biographique de Périgord'', p. 713. ISBN 978-2-86577-214-8&lt;/ref&gt; joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6 new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included [[Suramin|Germanin]] and [[tryparsamide]]. Dr. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera [[vibrion]] (facultative anaerobic [[bacteria]]). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.

He was there again from 1929-1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937 he returned again to Lambaréné, and continued working there throughout the Second World War.

==Controversy and criticism==
===Schweitzer's views===
Schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus' call to become &quot;fishers of men&quot; but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European [[colonialism|colonizers]]:&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. ''On the Edge of the Primeval Forest''. New York: [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]. 1931. p. 115. {{OCLC|2097590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |&quot;Who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they [the coloured peoples] have suffered at the hands of Europeans? ... If a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races, it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over unread because their contents would be too horrible.&quot;}}

Rather than being a supporter of colonialism, Schweitzer was one of its harshest critics.  In a sermon that he preached on 6 January 1905, before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in Africa, he said:&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert, and James Brabazon. ''Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings''. Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books. 2005. pp. 76–80. ISBN 1570756023.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |&quot;Our culture divides people into two classes: civilized men, a title bestowed on the persons who do the classifying; and others, who have only the human form, who may perish or go to the dogs for all the &quot;civilized men&quot; care.''

&quot;Oh, this &quot;noble&quot; culture of ours! It speaks so piously of human dignity and human rights and then disregards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and treads them underfoot, only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different color or because they cannot help themselves. This culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of glib talk it is, how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there, and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights...

&quot;I will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice. People robbed native inhabitants of their land, made slaves of them, let loose the scum of mankind upon them. Think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us, how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic &quot;gifts&quot;, and everything else we have done...We decimate them, and then, by the stroke of a pen, we take their land so they have nothing left at all...

&quot;If all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the German God, or the American God, or the British God, and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be 'Christian'—then the name of Jesus is blasphemed and made a mockery. And the Christianity of our states is blasphemed and made a mockery before those poor people. The name of Jesus has become a curse, and our Christianity—yours and mine—has become a falsehood and a disgrace, if the crimes are not atoned for in the very place where they were instigated. For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus' name, someone must step in to help in Jesus' name; for every person who robbed, someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed, someone must bless.

&quot;And now, when you speak about missions, let this be your message: We must make atonement for all the terrible crimes we read of in the newspapers. We must make atonement for the still worse ones, which we do not read about in the papers, crimes that are shrouded in the silence of the jungle night...&quot;}}

===Criticism of Schweitzer===
Schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic or colonialist in his attitude towards Africans, and in some ways his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism.  For instance, he thought Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances. Edgar Berman quotes Schweitzer speaking these lines in 1960:&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Edgar. ''In Africa With Schweitzer''. Far Hills, New Jersey: New Horizon Press. 1986, p. 139. ISBN 0882820257.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |&quot;No society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow.&quot;}}

[[Chinua Achebe]] has quoted Schweitzer as saying: &quot;The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe. [http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/achcon.htm &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness.&quot;]&amp;nbsp;— the [[Massachusetts Review]]. 1977. (c/o [[North Carolina State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; which Achebe criticized him for, though Achebe seems to acknowledge that Schweitzer's use of the word &quot;brother&quot; at all was, for a European of the early 20th century, an unusual expression of human solidarity between whites and blacks.  Later in his life, Schweitzer was quoted as saying: &quot;The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Source: Quoted by Lachlan Forrow in his Foreword to the 2002 edition of ''African Notebook''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also more likely that Schweitzer was speaking in terms of modern civilization than of class relationship of man; this would be consistent with his later statement that &quot;the time for speaking of older and younger brothers is over&quot;, and his discussion of the modernization of &quot;primeval&quot; societies.  Later in life he became more convinced that &quot;modern civilization&quot; was actually inferior or the same in morality than previous cultures.

The journalist [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]] visited Lambaréné in 1953 (when Schweitzer was 78) and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities, and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James | last = Cameron | title = Point of Departure | year = 1966 [1978] | publisher = Law Book Co of Australasia | pages = 154–74 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WM89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22Albert+Schweitzer%22+%22James+Cameron%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ZTmqWzWjEs&amp;sig=Ag6WBNCSdhBzs2M0fOqmsbmqtuk&amp;hl=en#PPA174,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time: according to a recent BBC dramatisation,&lt;ref&gt;On Monday 7 April 2008 ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009przg &quot;The Walrus and the Terrier&quot;]&amp;nbsp;— programme outline) [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast an ''[[The Afternoon Play (BBC)|Afternoon Play]]'' &quot;The Walrus and the Terrier&quot; by Christopher Ralling concerning Cameron's visit.&lt;/ref&gt; he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story, and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé aimed at debunking Schweitzer.

American journalist John Gunther also visited Lambaréné in the 1950s and reported Schweitzer's patronizing attitude towards Africans.  He also noted the lack of Africans trained to be skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Inside Africa | publisher = Harper | location = New York | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three decades in Africa Schweitzer still depended on Europe for nurses.  By comparison, his contemporary [[Albert Ruskin Cook|Sir Albert Cook]] in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Luganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Amagezi Agokuzalisa | publisher = Sheldon Press | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverence for Life==
{{Main|Reverence for Life}}
[[Image:Albert Schweitzer, Etching by Arthur William Heintzelman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Albert Schweitzer, Etching by Arthur William Heintzelman.]]
The keynote of Schweitzer's personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of ''[[Reverence for Life]]'' (&quot;''Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben''&quot;). He thought that [[western culture|Western civilization]] was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of (and respect for) life as its [[Ethics|ethical foundation]].

In the Preface to ''Civilization and Ethics'' (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from [[Descartes]] to [[Kant]] had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirmating optimism of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as [[Will (philosophy)|will]], expressed in the [[pessimism|pessimist philosophies]] from [[Schopenhauer]] onward. Scientific materialism (advanced by [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.

Schweitzer wrote: &quot;True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness, and this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Civilization and Ethics'', Chapter 21, p.253: reprinted as A. Schweitzer,  ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', ([[Prometheus Books]], Buffalo 1987), Chapter 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.

Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian [[Brahmin]]ic philosophy.

For Schweitzer, Mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to [[volition]] or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice-versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Civilization and Ethics'', Preface and Chapter II, 'The Problem of the Optimistic World-View'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According some authors, Schweitzer's thought and specifically his development for reverence for life was influenced by [[Indian religions|Indian religious]] thought and in particular [[Jain]] principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence) &lt;ref&gt;Ara Paul Barsam (2002) &quot;Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life&quot; in:''Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century'' Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, ISBN 9780815629771 p. 207-08&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) ''Albert Schweitzer: an anthology'' Beacon Press&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, ancient Indian thought - and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.}}

==Later life==
[[Image:Albert-Schweitzer-Haus.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Schweitzer house and Museum at Königsfeld in the Black Forest.]]
After the birth of their daughter, Albert's wife, Mme Helene Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health.  In 1923 the family moved to [[Königsfeld im Schwarzwald]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], where he was building a house for the family.  This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum - [[www.albertschweitzer-haus.de]].

[[Image:RIMG0149.JPG|thumb|175px|left|Albert Schweitzer's house at Gunsbach, now a museum and archive.]]
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0423-317, Weimar, Albert-Schweitzer-Gedenkstätte.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Albert Schweitzer Memorial and Museum in [[Weimar]] (1984)]]
From 1939–48 he stayed in Lambaréné, unable to go back to Europe because of the war. Three years after the end of World War II, in 1948, he returned for the first time to Europe and kept traveling back and forth (and once to the USA) as long as he was able. During his return visits to his home village of Gunsbach, Schweitzer continued to make use of the family house, which after his death became an Archive and Museum to his life and work. His life was portrayed in the 1952 movie ''Il est minuit, Docteur Schweitzer'', starring [[Pierre Fresnay]] as Albert Schweitzer and [[Jeanne Moreau]] as his nurse Marie. Schweitzer inspired actor [[Hugh O'Brian]] when O'Brian visited in Africa.  O'Brian returned to the United States and founded the [[Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation]] (HOBY).

The Nobel Peace Prize of 1952 was awarded to Dr Albert Schweitzer.  His &quot;The Problem of Peace&quot; lecture is considered one of the best speeches ever given. From 1952 until his death he worked against [[nuclear tests]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s with [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. In 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over Radio Oslo which were published in ''Peace or Atomic War''. In 1957, Schweitzer was one of the founders of [[Peace Action|The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]]. On 23 April 1957, Dr. Schweitzer made his &quot;Declaration of Conscience&quot; speech; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons. He ended his speech, saying:&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennesseeplayers.org/declaration.html Declaration of Conscience speech]&amp;nbsp;— at Tennessee Players&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |&quot;The end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for.&quot;}}

In 1955 he was made an honorary member of the [[Order of Merit]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1747.asp |title=List of Members of the Order of Merit, past and present |publisher=British Monarchy |accessdate=2 December 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a [[Knight|chevalier]] of the [[Order of St Lazarus|Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem]]. Schweitzer died on 4 September 1965 at his beloved hospital in [[Lambaréné]], [[Gabon]]. His grave, on the banks of the Ogowe River, is marked by a cross he made himself.

His grand niece Anne-Marie Schweitzer Sartre was the mother of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Schweitzer was a vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ivu.org/history/europe20a/schweitzer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-creatures.org/cva/th-schweitzer-albert.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship was founded in 1940 by Dr. Schweitzer to unite U.S. supporters in filling the gap in support for his Hospital when his European supply lines was cut off by war, and continues to support the Lambaréné Hospital today.  Schweitzer, however, considered his ethic of Reverence for Life, not his Hospital, his most important legacy, saying that his Lambaréné Hospital was just &quot;my own improvisation on the theme of Reverence for Life.  Everyone can have their own Lambaréné.&quot;  Today ASF helps large numbers of young Americans in health-related professional fields find or create &quot;their own Lambaréné&quot; in the U.S. or internationally.  ASF selects and supports nearly 250 new U.S. and Africa Schweitzer Fellows each year from over 100 of the leading U.S. schools of medicine, nursing, public health, and every other health-related field (including music, law, and divinity), helping launch them on lives of Schweitzer-spirited service.  The peer-supporting lifelong network of &quot;Schweitzer Fellows for Life&quot; numbered over 2,000 members in 2008, and is growing by nearly 1,000 every four years.  Nearly 150 of these Schweitzer Fellows have served at the Hospital in Lambaréné, for three month periods during their last year of medical school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Schweitzerfellowship.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
*&quot;Do something wonderful, people may imitate it.&quot;
*&quot;Therefore search and see if there is not some place where you may invest your humanity.&quot;
*&quot;There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.&quot;
*&quot;Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust and hostility to evaporate.&quot;
*&quot;A man is truly ethical only when he obeys the compulsion to help all life which he is able to assist, and shrinks from injuring anything that lives.&quot;
*&quot;Example is not the main thing in influencing others. It is the only thing.&quot;
*&quot;In the hopes of reaching the moon men fail to see the flowers that blossom at their feet.&quot;
*&quot;The time will come when public opinion will no longer tolerate amusements based on the mistreatment and killing of animals.&quot;
*&quot;Until he extends the circle of his compassion to all living things, man will not himself find peace.&quot;
*&quot;Think occasionally of the suffering of which you spare yourself the sight.&quot;
*&quot;The tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives.&quot;

==Sound recordings==
Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD. During 1934 and 1935 he was for some time in Britain, delivering the Gifford Lectures at [[Edinburgh University]], and those on ''Religion in Modern Civilization'' at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of London|London]]. He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old [[Queen's Hall]] in London. These records did not satisfy him, the instrument being too harsh. In mid-December 1935 he began to record for [[Columbia Records]] on the organ of [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower|All Hallows, Barking-by-the-Tower]] (London).&lt;ref&gt;This fine 1909 [[Harrison and Harrison]] organ was blitzed in the War (cf W. Kent, The Lost Treasures of London (Phoenix House 1947), 94-95) but was rebuilt in 1957, see [http://www.harrison-organs.co.uk/london.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of Ste Aurélie in [[Strasbourg]], on a mid-18th century organ by Johann Andreas [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] (brother of Gottfried), an organ-builder greatly revered by Bach, which had been restored by the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] organ-builder Frédéric Härpfer shortly before the First World War. These recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in October 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver 1951, 139-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Schweitzer Technique===
Dr. Schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of Bach's music.  Known as &quot;The Schweitzer Technique&quot;, it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The '''Austrian School''' is a [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] [[Schools of economic thought|school of economic thought]] that emphasizes the [[spontaneous order|spontaneous organizing]] power of the [[price mechanism]]. Its name derives from the identity of its founders and early supporters, who were citizens of the old Austrian [[Habsburg Empire]], including [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureate]] [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/AustrianSchoolofEconomics.html The Austrian School of Economics], [[Peter J. Boettke]]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, adherents of the Austrian School can come from any part of the world, but they are often referred to simply as '''Austrian economists''' and their work as '''Austrian economics'''.

The Austrian School was influential in the late 19th and early 20th century. Austrian contributions to mainstream economic thought include involvement in the development of the [[marginalist revolution|neoclassical theory of value]] and the [[subjective theory of value]] on which it is based, as well as contributions to the &quot;[[economic calculation debate]]&quot; which concerns the allocative properties of a [[centrally planned economy]] versus a decentralized [[free market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Birner &amp; Rudy Van Zijp.

Austrian School economists generally hold that the complexity of human behavior makes mathematical modeling of an evolving market extremely difficult (or [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]) and advocate a ''[[laissez faire]]'' approach to the economy. They advocate the strict enforcement of voluntary contractual agreements between economic agents, and hold that commercial transactions should be subject to the smallest possible imposition of [[coercion|coercive]] forces.  In particular, they argue for an extremely limited role for government and the smallest possible amount of [[government]] intervention in the economy.

==History and mainstream opinion==
[[Classical economics]] focused on the [[labour theory of value]], which holds that the value of a commodity is equal to the amount of labour required to produce it. In the late 19th century, however, attention was focused on the concepts of “marginal” cost and value. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the [[Marginal revolution#The Marginal Revolution|marginalist revolution]] of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] approach in economics.&lt;ref name=keizer&gt;{{cite book |last=Keizer |first=Willem |title=Austrian Economics in Debate |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-14054-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Menger's 1871 book, ''[[Principles of Economics]]'' was the catalyst for this development; while [[marginalism]] was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that grew up around Menger, which came to be known as the “Psychological School,” “Vienna School,” or “Austrian School.”&lt;ref&gt;Israel M. Kirzner (1987). &quot;Austrian School of Economics,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 145–151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorstein Veblen]] introduced the term [[neoclassical economics]] in his ''Preconceptions of Economic Science'' (1900) to distinguish marginalists in the objective cost tradition of [[Alfred Marshall]] from those in the subjective valuation tradition of the Austrian School.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein Bunde; “The Preconceptions of Economic Science” Pt III, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' v14 (1900).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colander&quot; &gt;Colander, David; ''The Death of Neoclassical Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian economics is closely associated with the advocacy of ''laissez-faire'' views. The Austrian School, especially through the works of Friedrich Hayek, was influential in the revival of ''laissez-faire'' thought in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kasper |first=Sherryl Davis |title=The Revival of Laissez-faire in American Macroeconomic Theory |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-84064-606-1 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and etymology===
The school originated in [[Vienna]], in the [[Austrian Empire]]. However, later adherents of the school such as [[Murray Rothbard]] have derived the roots of the thought of the Austrian School from the Spanish [[Scholastics]] teaching at the [[University of Salamanca]] of the 15th century and the French [[Physiocrats]] of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/etexts/austrian.asp What is Austrian economics?]&lt;/ref&gt; The School owes its name to members of the German [[Historical school of economics|Historical School of economics]], who argued against the Austrians during the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' (&quot;methodology struggle&quot;), in which the Austrians defended the reliance that classical economists placed upon deductive logic. Their Prussian opponents derisively named them the &quot;Austrian School&quot; to emphasize a departure from mainstream German thought and to suggest a provincial, [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach.

Specifically, in 1883 Menger published ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere),'' which attacked the methods of the Historical school. [[Gustav von Schmoller]], a leader of the Historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term &quot;Austrian school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Menger’s approach—haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, as merely “Austrian,” the origin of that label—led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in Europe and, later, in the United States.'' [[Peter G. Klein]], 2007; in the Foreword to ''Principles of Economics'', Carl Menger; trns. James Dingwall and Bert F. Hoselitz, 1976; Ludwig von Mises Institute, Alabama; 2007; ISBN 978-1-933550-12-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Psychological School&quot; derived from the effort to found marginalism upon prior considerations, largely psychological – compare [[behavioral economics]]. The school was no longer centered in Austria after [[Hitler]] came to power, and is now based almost entirely in the United States.

===First wave===
Carl Menger was closely followed by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and [[Friedrich von Wieser]], in what is known as the &quot;first wave&quot; of the School. Austrian economists developed a sense of themselves as a school distinct from neoclassical economics during the economic calculation debate with [[socialist economics|socialist economists]]. Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich A. Hayek represented the Austrian position in contending that without monetary prices and private property, meaningful economic calculation is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Tibor Machan |last = Machan | first = Tibor | title = The Morality of Business | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-387-48906-3 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian economist Böhm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of Marx in the 1880s and 1890s, as was part of the Austrian economists' participation in the late 19th Century ''Methodenstreit'', during which they attacked the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] doctrines of the Historical School.

===Inter-war period===
Austrian economics after 1920 can be broken into two general trends. One, exemplified by Friedrich A. Hayek, while distrusting many neoclassical concepts (like most of the corpus of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macroeconomics]]), generally accepts a large part of the neoclassical methodology; the other, exemplified by Ludwig von Mises, seeks a different formalism for [[economics]], considering the neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/cyat2g9b66agrfhm/ Stalebrink, Odd J.''The Hayek and Mises Controversy''] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Austrian school economists, the main area of contention between the mainstream and the Austrian school is on their view of the market system as a process, not only to be studied using equilibrium models, but to be viewed as an incessant process that only tends toward a constantly changing equilibrium.  This difference is the root of the [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory|Austrian business cycle theory]], the economic calculation debate, and their different views of monopoly and competition. Austrians often note that Hayek warned about the impending stock market crash in 1929 in stark contrast to contemporary economist, [[Irving Fisher]], who only days before the crash claimed that the US stock market had reached a permanent high plateau.&lt;ref name=mises&gt;[http://mises.org/media/4535 Mises]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second area of contention between neoclassical theory and the Austrian school is over the possibility of [[indifference curve|consumers being indifferent]] between choices {{ndash}} neoclassical theory says it is possible, whereas Mises rejected it as being “impossible to observe in practice.”  Additionally, Mises and his students argued, building on Czech economist František Čuhel (1862–1914),&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcpe.libinst.cz/nppe/3_1/nppe3_1_4.pdf Cuhel, Franz: &quot;On the Theory of Needs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; that utility functions are [[ordinal scale|ordinal]], and not [[cardinal number|cardinal]]; that is, the Austrians contend that one can only rank preferences and cannot measure their intensity.  The Austrian School rejects any neoclassical results that are based on [[cardinal utility]] and criticizes mainstream economics for supposedly accepting cardinality,&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae2_4_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that neoclassical economists have shown that their work holds for [[ordinal utility|ordinal preferences]].&lt;ref&gt;

The utility function approach is based as squarely on ordinal utility as Rothbard's is. The modern neoclassical theorists - such as Arrow and Debreau - who developed the utility function approach went out of their way to avoid the use of cardinal utility.[7] ...To sum up, Rothbard falsely accused neoclassical utility theory of assuming cardinality. It does not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_journal&quot;/&gt;

Finally there are a host of questions about uncertainty and the utility of &quot;conventional&quot; [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets|financial models]] raised by Mises and other Austrians, who argue for a fundamentally different means of [[risk assessment]] in economics compared to that used by the [[mainstream economics|mainstream]].  Mises and others argued that numerically accurate &quot;probabilities&quot; could ''never'' be assigned to &quot;singular&quot; cases.  The utility and accuracy of financial modeling is an on-going source of debate, even within the Austrian School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mises.org/archives/010129.asp On the Possibility of Assigning Probabilities to Singular Cases, or: Probability is Subjective Too!], by Mark R. Crovelli&lt;/ref&gt; These questions are directly linked to the dynamic market process approach to economic theory, where it is argued by Mises and others that the unique confluence of events in each moment of time in real markets makes the assignment of &quot;objective&quot; probabilities unrealistic, as these events are intrinsically unique and not capable of numerical probabilistic modeling.  Mises and others argued that the application of probabilistic uncertainty would require the ability to exactly replicate objectively similar events to obtain an accurate understanding of the range of probabilistic outcomes of any event, and this is not possible in ''real'' markets, where past market events intimately affect the present and the future.

=== Later reputation ===
Austrian economics was ill-thought of by most economists after [[World War II]] because it rejected mathematical and statistical methods in the area of economics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/kq577622488v4447/fulltext.pdf Austrian economics and the mainstream: View from the boundary]&quot; by Roger E. Backhouse, $34 to view {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reputation rose somewhat in the late 20th century with the work of [[Israel Kirzner]] and [[Ludwig Lachmann]], as well as a renewed interest in Hayek after he won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meijer |first=G. |title=New Perspectives on Austrian Economics |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-415-12283-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Hayek, one of Ludwig von Mises's students, [[Murray Rothbard]], became prominent in both Austrian applied theory and [[Libertarian]] philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;See the online collection of Murray Rothbard's writings [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard-lib.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains a distinctly minority position, even in such areas as capital value.

===Legacy===
Two modern schools of thought are seen as being either Austrian economics, or as the direct philosophical heir of Austrian economic philosophy. These are the [[Free Banking]] school and the [[Rothbardian]] movement. Although they have competing views of monetary policy, they share a fundamental view of most economic philosophy. Free Banking advocates see themselves as coming directly from Hayek's later progress, especially his ''[[The Denationalization of Money]]'', while the Rothbardians follow the views of deceased founder [[Murray Rothbard]] and his interpretation of Austrian economists, especially Mises.

Currently, universities with a significant Austrian presence are George Mason University, [[Loyola University New Orleans]], and [[Auburn University]] in the United States and [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in Guatemala. The library of Universidad Francisco Marroquín is named after Ludwig von Mises, and the university also provides seminars and lectures through a program named for Austrian School proponent [[Henry Hazlitt]]. Austrian economic ideas are also promoted heavily by bodies such as the [[Mises Institute]] and the [[Foundation for Economic Education]].  In May 2010, [[Antal E. Fekete]] declared his intention to establish a New School of Austrian Economics in [[Budapest]], based on the [[Real bills doctrine]], but the status of this &quot;New Austrian School&quot; remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professorfekete.com/articles%5CAEFNewAustrianSchoolOfEconomics.pdf The New Austrian School of Economics] by Antal E. Fekete&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable contemporary Austrian economists include [[David Emmanuel Andersson]], [[Peter Boettke]], [[Donald Boudreaux]], [[William Butos]], [[Chris Coyne]], [[Daniel D'Amico]], [[Richard Ebling]], [[Randall Holcombe]], [[Steven Horwitz]], [[Sandford Ikeda]], [[Peter Klein]], [[Roger Koppl]], [[Peter Leeson]], [[Peter Lewin]], [[David Prychitko]], [[Lawrence Reed]], [[Mario Rizzo]], [[Russ Roberts]], and [[Larry White]].

==Influence==
According to Austrian school economist [[Peter J. Boettke]], during its history the position of the Austrian School within the economics profession has changed several times from the center to the fringe of the mainstream. By the mid-1930s, the mainstream had more or less absorbed what were seen as the important contributions of the Austrians, and it is currently a distinctly minority position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boettke and Leeson&quot;/&gt;

The former [[U.S. Federal Reserve]] Chairman, [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000, &quot;the Austrian school have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan. &quot;Hearings before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services.&quot; U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services.

==Methodology==
[[File:Austrianphilosophy.jpg|left|thumb|Philosophical tree of the Austrian School]]

Austrian economists reject empirical [[Econometrics|statistical methods]], [[natural experiment]]s and [[Experimental economics|constructed experiments]] as tools applicable to economics, saying that while it is appropriate in the natural sciences where factors can be isolated in laboratory conditions, the actions of human beings are too complex for this &quot;numerical&quot; treatment as passive non-adaptive subjects. Instead one should isolate the logical processes of human action. Von Mises called this discipline &quot;praxeology&quot; – a term he adapted from [[Alfred Espinas]] (but which had been in use by others).&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva: Union, 1940), p. 3; Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1949] 1998), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian praxeological method is based on the heavy use of logical [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from what they assert to be undeniable, self-evident [[axioms]] or irrefutable facts about human existence. The primary axiom from which Austrian economists deduce further certain conclusions is the action axiom, which holds that humans take conscious action toward chosen goals.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1995] 2007), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian economists focus on goal-directed action and say that it is undeniable because in order to deny action, one would have to employ action in the act of denial.

Methodology is the one area where Austrian economists differ most significantly from other schools of economic thought. Mainstream schools such as the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]], the [[Chicago school of economics]], the [[Keynesian]]s and [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesians]], adopt [[empirics|empirical]], mathematical and statistical methods, and focus on [[inductive reasoning|induction]] to construct and test theories—while Austrian economists reject this approach in favor of deduction and logically deduced inferences. According to Austrian economists, deduction is preferred, since if performed correctly, it leads to certain conclusions and inferences that must be true if the underlying assumptions are accurate. However Austrian economist Robert Murphy has stated that those using Austrian theories can still err in their interpretations of history, even if based on a theory formulated by deduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Robert P. | last = Murphy | date = 28 July 2009 | location = Mises University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caplan makes a similar point about ''quantitative significance'', explaining that a theory, such as one which logically relates minimum wage and unemployment, tells nothing of the approximate quantity of change in unemployment one can expect upon minimum wage increases.

Austrian economists hold that induction does not assure certainty like deduction, as real world economic data are inherently ambiguous and subject to a multitude of influences which cannot be separated or quantified, one cause or correlation from another. Austrians therefore claim that mainstream economics has no way of verifying cause and effect in real work economic events, since economic data which can be correlated to multiple potential chains of causation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/ausfin2.doc The Austrian Search for Realistic Foundations], Brian Caplan&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream economists counter that conclusions that can be reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Samuelson&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Samuelson |first=Paul |title=Economics |publisher=New York: McGraw-Hill |year=1964 |edition=6th |page=736 |isbn=978-0-07-074741-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the Austrian school contend that by rejecting mathematics and econometrics, it has failed to contribute significantly to modern economics. Additionally, they contend that its methods currently consist of [[post-hoc analysis]] and do not generate testable implications; therefore, they fail the test of [[falsifiability]] as prescribed by the scientific method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BC1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Hayek's Challenge|publisher=The University of Chicago Press |first=Bruce |last=Caldwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-226-09191-4 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian economists counter that [[Experimental economics|testability in economics]] is virtually impossible since it relies on human actors who cannot be placed in a lab setting without altering their would-be actions.

===Criticism of mainstream practices===
Austrians hold their methodology to be superior to the [[scientific method]] and [[empiricism]], principles which mainstream economists strive to follow. On the Austrian critiques of mainstream economics, economist Bryan Caplan has argued that, &quot;Mises and Rothbard reject the foundations of modern neoclassical economics too quickly, and their substitutes are inadequate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot; /&gt; 

==== Predictive ability ==== 
In their rejection of mainstream practices, Austrians have argued that mainstream economics has an unsatisfactory record of prediction, citing the [[Global Financial Crisis]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/thornton/thornton38.html You Heard It Here First], Mark Thornton, LRC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/media/4019 Business Cycles and Prediction, Mark Thornton]&lt;/ref&gt; Another example cited by Austrians is Keynesian economist [[Paul Samuelson]]'s claim, as late as 1989, that socialism was economically out-performing capitalism.&lt;ref name=ls20110204&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/pboettke/workshop/archives/f05/scientism.pdf |title=Sammy's Prediction |author= Gene Callahan and Peter Leeson|date= |work=Scientism in the Way of Science: Hope for Heterodoxy in Modern Economics |publisher= London School of Economics|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sammy1989&gt;Samuelson, Paul and William Nordhaus (1989) Economics, 13th ed., New York:
McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, some mainstream economists have pointed out that Austrian school economists do not have a better record at prediction. Accoding to Mark Skousen, adherents of Austrian economics failed in their timing or description of financial crises; as, for example, Ludwig von Mises's failed prediction regarding a collapse of the British pound,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Mark| last = Skousen| contribution = The making of modern economics: the lives and ideas of the great thinkers| contribution-url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QV2OJqbt45oC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;lpg=PA292| year = 2001| quote=In September 1931, Ursula Hicks (wife of John Hicks) was attending Mises’ seminar in Vienna when England suddenly announced it was going off the gold standard.

==Academic and political background==
Austrian school theorists, like Ludwig von Mises, insist that ''praxeology'' must be [[positive economics|value-free]]—that the method does not answer the question &quot;should this policy be implemented?&quot;, but rather &quot;if this policy is implemented, will it have [[Law of unintended consequences|the effects you intend]]&quot;? However, Austrian economists often make policy recommendations that call for the elimination of government regulations and their policy prescriptions often overlap with libertarian or [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] solutions. These recommendations are similar to, but further reaching than the [[minarchism|minarchist]] ideas of Chicago School economists, and frequently address issues that other schools ignore, such as [[monetary reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skousen | first = Mark | title = Vienna &amp; Chicago, Friends or Foes? | publisher = Capital Press/Regnery Pub | location = Washington | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-89526-029-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools advocate strict protection of private property, and support for [[individualism]] in general,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Individualism and Economic Order |author=F. A. Hayek |authorlink=Friedrich Hayek |isbn=978-0-226-32093-9 |year=1980 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often cited by [[libertarianism|libertarian]], [[classical liberalism|classical or ''laissez-faire'' liberal]], [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]], and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] groups for support.

Austrian economists view [[entrepreneurship]] as the driving force in [[economic development]], see [[private property]] as essential to the efficient use of resources, and usually (if not always) see government interference in market processes as counterproductive. In this, their views do not differ far from those of the Chicago school.

As with neoclassical economists, Austrian economists reject classical cost of production theories, most famously the [[labor theory of value]]. Instead they explain value by reference to the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective preferences of individuals]]. This psychological aspect to Menger's economics has been attributed to the school's birth in turn of the century Vienna. [[Supply and demand]] are explained by aggregating over the decisions of individuals, following the precepts of [[methodological individualism]], which asserts that only individuals and not collectives make decisions, and marginalist arguments, which compare the costs and benefits for incremental changes.

Contemporary neo-Austrian economists claim to adopt [[economic subjectivism]] more consistently than any other school of economics and reject many neoclassical formalisms. For example, while neoclassical economics formalizes the economy as an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] system with supply and demand in balance, Austrian economists emphasize its dynamic, perpetually dis-equilibrated nature.

The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Subjectivism, intelligibility and economic understanding: essays in honor of Ludwig M. Lachmann on his eightieth birthday |last1=Kirzner |first1=Israel M. |last2=Lachman |first2=Ludwig M. |publisher=McMillan |year=1986 |edition=Illustrated |isbn=978-0-333-41788-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its original and purist sense, opportunity cost doctrine argues that the only [[cost]] relevant to the [[price]] of a product is the [[opportunity cost|cost]] involved in choosing it over other competing, and mutually exclusive, options, and its technical coefficients of production. In the 1930s [[Gottfried Haberler]] applied the doctrine to the problems of foreign trade, confident that much of the work done in classical economics to incorporate the much broader array of costs in price analysis could be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Studies in the Theory of International Trade |last=Viner |first=Jacob |year=1965 |publisher=Harper and Brothers Publishers |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1414&amp;chapter=45609&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#lf0619_footnote_nt1243 |chapter=“Opportunity Cost” Analysis as a Substitute for Real Cost Analysis |isbn=978-0-678-00122-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on opportunity cost alone means that their interpretation of the [[time value]] of a good has a strict relationship: since goods will be as restricted by scarcity at a later point in time as they are now, the strict relationship between investment and time must also hold. A factory making goods next year is worth much less than the goods it is making next year are worth. This means that the business cycle is driven by mis-coordination between sectors of the same economy, caused by money not carrying incentive information correct about present choices, rather than within a single economy where money causes people to make bad decisions about how to spend their time.

==Contributions==
Some general contributions of Austrian economists:
* A theory of distribution in which [[factor price]]s result from the [[imputation (economics)|imputation]] of prices of consumer goods to goods of &quot;higher order&quot;, that is goods used in the production of consumer goods (goods of the first order).
* A fundamental rejection of mathematical methods in economics, seeing the function of economics as investigating the essences rather than the specific quantities of economic phenomena. This was seen as an evolutionary, or &quot;genetic-causal&quot;, approach against the alleged &quot;unreality&quot; and internal stresses inherent in the &quot;static&quot; approach of equilibrium and [[perfect competition]], which are the foundations of mainstream Neoclassical economics (see also [[praxeology]]). This methodology is also driven by the belief that econometrics is inherently misleading in that it creates a fallacious &quot;precision&quot; in economics where there is none.
* [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]]'s critique of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], which centered on the untenability of the labor theory of value in the light of the [[transformation problem]]. There was also the connected argument that capitalists do not exploit workers; they ''accommodate'' workers by providing them with income well in advance of the revenue from the output they helped to produce.
* Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's capital theory, which equates [[capital intensity]] with the degree of [[roundaboutness]] of production processes.
* Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's demonstration that the law of marginal utility, as formulated by [[Carl Menger|Menger]] necessarily implies the classical law of costs and hence the vast majority of the conclusions of the British classical economists. This discovery was later fully developed and its implications traced by a student of von Mises, [[George Reisman]], in his book, ''Capitalism''.
* An emphasis on opportunity cost and reservation demand in defining [[marginal theory of value|value]], and a refusal to consider supply as an otherwise independent cause of value.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Values are not seen (as they are in Marshallian economics) as ''jointly'' determined by subjective (utility) and objective (physical cost) considerations. Rather, values are seen as  determined ''solely'' by the actions of consumers... Cost is seen (by Menger, and especially by Wieser...) merely as prospective utility deliberately sacrificed (in order to command more highly preferred utility).&quot;  Israel M. Kirzner, &quot;The Austrian School of Economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: Dictionary of Economics'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; (The British economist [[Philip Wicksteed]] adopted this perspective.)
* The Mises-Hayek [[business cycle]] theory, which is asserted as explaining depression as a reaction to an intertemporal production structure fostered by [[monetary policy]] setting [[interest rate]]s inconsistent with individual time preferences.
* Hayek's concept of [[intertemporal equilibrium]]. ([[John Hicks]] took over this theory in his discussion of temporary equilibrium in ''Value and Capital,'' a book very influential on the development of neoclassical economics after World War II.)
* Mises{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and Hayek's view of prices as permitting agents to make use of [[dispersed knowledge|dispersed tacit knowledge]].
* The [[time preference theory of interest]], which explains interest rates through [[intertemporal choice]] - the different time preferences of the borrower or lender - rather than as a price paid for a [[factor of production]].
* The [[economic calculation debate]] between Austrian and [[Marxist]] economists, with the Austrians claiming that Marxism is flawed because prices could not be set to recognize opportunity costs of factors of production, and so [[socialism]] could not make rational decisions.
* [[Friedrich Hayek]] was one of the few economists who gave warning of a major economic crisis before [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|the great crash]] of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of Modern Economics |last=Skousen |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Skousen |year=2001 |publisher=M.E.

* Stressing uncertainty in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on &quot;[[Homo economicus]]&quot; or the rational man who was fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. The fact that perfect knowledge never exists, means that all economic activity implies risk.
* Seeing the entrepreneurs' role as collecting and evaluating information and acting on risks.

==Notable theories==
===Economic calculation problem===
{{Main|Economic calculation problem}}
The economic calculation problem is a criticism of [[socialist economics]]. It was first proposed by [[Max Weber]] in 1920. This led to Ludwig von Mises discussing Weber's idea with his student Friedrich Hayek, who expanded upon it to such an extent that it became a key reason cited for the awarding of his Nobel prize.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth |accessdate=2008-09-08 |last=Von Mises |first=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |year=1990|format=PDF |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |url=http://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf |isbn=0945466072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, (1935), &quot;The Nature and History of the Problem&quot; and &quot;The Present State of the Debate,&quot; om in F. A. Hayek, ed. ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–243.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources rationally in an economy. The capitalist solution is the price mechanism; Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only viable solution, as the price mechanism co-ordinates supply and investment decisions most efficiently.  Without the information efficiently and effectively provided by market prices, socialism lacks a method to efficiently allocate resources over an extended period of time in any market where the price mechanism is effective (an example where the price mechanism may not work is in the relatively confined area of [[public goods|public]] and [[common good (economics)|common goods]]). 

Those who agree with this criticism argue it is a refutation of socialism and that it shows that a socialist [[planned economy]] could never work in the long term for the vast bulk of the economy and has very limited potential application. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as ''The Socialist Calculation Debate.''&lt;ref name=&quot;School&quot;&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm The socialist calculation debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig von Mises argued in a famous 1920 article &quot;[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]&quot; that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the [[means of production]], then no prices could be obtained for [[capital goods]] as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not &quot;objects of exchange,&quot; unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.&lt;ref name=&quot;School&quot; /&gt;  This led him to declare &quot;…that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises&quot; /&gt;  Mises's declaration has been criticized as overstating the strength of his case, in describing socialism as impossible, rather than having to contend with a source of inefficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_soc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Bryan |title=Is socialism really &quot;impossible&quot;? |journal=Critical Review |volume=16 |pages=33–52 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/08913810408443598 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot; /&gt;  A recent paper on this question has criticized the Austrian view from the viewpoint of [[computational complexity]], arguing that if finding a true economic equilibrium is not just hard but impossible for a central planner, then the impossibility applies equally well to a market system, since a system of dispersed calculators (i.e. a market) has no advantage over one large central calculator in overcoming [[Computational complexity theory#Turing Machine|complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Inflation===
The Austrian School has consistently argued that a &quot;traditionalist&quot; approach to inflation yields the most accurate understanding of the causes (and the cure) for [[inflation]].  Ludwig von Mises asserted that inflation only results when the supply of money outpaces demand for money:

:In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur. &lt;ref&gt;The Theory of Money and Credit, Mises (1912, [1981], p. 272) &lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Free Banking]] branch of Austrian economics maintains the above definition, the Rothbardian branch argues that inflation is ''by definition'' always and everywhere simply an increase in the money supply (i.e. units of currency or [[means of exchange]]), which in turn leads to a higher nominal price level for assets (such as housing) and other goods and services in demand, as the real value of each monetary unit is eroded, loses purchasing power and thus buys fewer goods and services. They generally deny the existence of a varying level of demand for money, that could balance an increased supply.

Given that all major economies currently have a [[central bank]] supporting the private banking system, money can be supplied into these economies by way of bank-created [[credit (finance)|credit]] (or [[debt]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/media/4014 The Economics of Legal Tender Laws], [[Jorg Guido Hulsmann]] (includes detailed commentary on central banking, inflation and [[fractional reserve banking|FRB]])&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Austrian economists]] believe that this bank-created credit growth (which forms the bulk of the money supply) sets off and creates volatile business cycles (''see'' [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]]) and maintain that this &quot;wave-like&quot; or &quot;boomerang&quot; effect on economic activity is one of the most damaging effects of monetary inflation.

According to the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, the central bank's policy of attempting to control the [[market economy]] is ineffective and creates volatile [[credit cycle]]s or [[business cycle]]s, and, as a necessary by-product, inflation (especially in asset markets).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/3127 Economic Depressions: Their Cause and Cure], Murray Rothbard&lt;/ref&gt;  By the central bank artificially &quot;stimulating&quot; the economy with artificially low interest rates (thereby permitting excessive increases in the [[money supply]]), the government-sponsored central bank itself allows debasement of the means of exchange (inflation), often focused in asset or capital markets, resulting in &quot;false signals&quot; going out to the market place, in turn resulting in clusters of malinvestments, and the artificial lowering of the returns on savings, which eventually causes the malinvestments to be liquidated as they inevitably show their underlying unprofitability and unsustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/story/2901 Thorsten Polleit, ''Inflation Is a Policy that Cannot Last'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian School economists therefore regard the state-sponsored central bank as the main cause of inflation, because they regard the bank as the institution charged with the creation of new money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north803.html Why Deflation Is not Inevitable (Sadly)], Gary North&lt;/ref&gt;  When newly created [[Bank reserves|currency reserves]] are injected into the [[fractional-reserve banking]] system, private financial institutions generally choose to further expand the level of bank credit, which  multiplies the inflationary effect many times over.&lt;ref&gt;Charles T. Hatch, ’’Inflationary Deception’’ http://mises.org/journals/scholar/hatch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian School also views the &quot;contemporary&quot; definition of inflation as inherently misleading in that it draws attention only to the ''effect'' of inflation (rising prices) and does not address the &quot;true&quot; phenomenon of inflation, which they believe simply involves an increase in the money supply (or the debasement of the means of exchange).  They argue that this semantic difference is important in defining inflation and finding a cure for inflation.  Austrian School economists maintain the most effective cure is the strict maintenance of a stable money supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/story/908 |title=Defining Inflation |accessdate=2008-09-20 |last=Shostak, Ph.D |first=Frank |date=2002-03-02 |publisher=Mises Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ludwig von Mises, the seminal scholar of the Austrian School, asserts that:

[[File:Components of US Money supply (logscale).svg|thumb|right|420px|Figure 1. Components of the US money supply as measured in modern economics.  Included are the printed dollar bills, as well as other bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check.  The currency printed by the Federal government (through the Federal Reserve) is the blue line at the bottom, and the [[Checking account|checkable deposits]] is the green line in the middle.  The M2 money measure, in red, is generally dominated by funds held in private institutions, far exceeding the value of the currency printed by the Federal government.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check. But people today use the term `inflation' to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise. The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation. . . . As you cannot talk about something that has no name, you cannot fight it. Those who pretend to fight inflation are in fact only fighting what is the inevitable consequence of inflation, rising prices. Their ventures are doomed to failure because they do not attack the root of the evil. They try to keep prices low while firmly committed to a policy of increasing the quantity of money that must necessarily make them soar. As long as this terminological confusion is not entirely wiped out, there cannot be any question of stopping inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=von Mises |chapter=Economic Freedom and Interventionism |editor1-first=Bettina B. |editor1-last=Greaves |title=Economics of Mobilization |publisher=The Commercial and Financial Chronicle |location=Sulphur Springs, West Virginia |pages= |year=1980 |isbn= |chapterurl=http://mises.org/efandi/ch20.asp |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following their definition, Austrian economists measure the inflation by calculating the growth of what they call 'the true money supply', i.e. how many new units of money that are available for immediate use in exchange, that have been created over time.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises Institute, &quot;[http://mises.org/content/nofed/chart.aspx?series=TMS True Money Supply]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Salerno, (1987), Austrian Economic Newsletter, &quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen6_4_1.pdf The &quot;True&quot; Money Supply: A Measure of the Medium of Exchange in the U.S. Economy]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Shostak, (2000), &quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae3_4_3.pdf The Mystery of the Money Supply Definition]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation of inflation implies that, within a centralized banking system, inflation is always a distinct action taken by the central government or its central bank,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/1118 Money Multiplier: Myth or Reality?], Frank Shostak&lt;/ref&gt; which permits or allows an increase in the money supply.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises, [http://mises.org/books/Theory_Money_Credit/Contents.aspx The Theory of Money and Credit]&quot;, ISBN 978-0-913966-70-9 See also: Jesus Huerta de Soto, &quot;[http://mises.org/books/desoto.pdf Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles]&quot;, ISBN 0-945466-39-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Mises includes bank credit as a significant contributor to inflation; the value of bank credit generated by private financial institutions and held within checking accounts greatly exceeds the value of physical paper bills and metallic coins issued by the Federal government (see Figure 1).  In addition to state-induced monetary expansion via printing of paper money, the Austrian School also maintains that the effects of increasing the money supply are exacerbated by the credit expansion performed by private financial institutions practising fractional-reserve banking system, legally permitted in most economic and financial systems in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, &quot;[http://mises.org/rothbard/rothmoney.pdf What Has Government Done to Our Money?]&quot;, ISBN 978-0-945466-44-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian School economists claim that the state uses [[monetary inflation]] as one of the three means by which it can fund its activities, the other two being taxing and borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell]], interview on &quot;[http://mises.org:88/Now NOW with Bill Moyers]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Austrians often seek to identify reasons why the state resorts to allowing the creation new money (whether [[fiat money|fiat paper]] or electronic money) and what the new money is used for. Various forms of military spending are often cited as reasons for resorting to inflation and borrowing, as this can be a short term way of acquiring marketable resources and is often favored by desperate, indebted governments.&lt;ref&gt;Lew Rockwell, &quot;[http://mises.org/story/3010 War and Inflation]&quot;, Ludwig von Mises Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, the central bank may try avoid or defer the widespread bankruptcies and insolvencies which cause economic [[recession]]s or [[depression (economics)|depressions]] by artificially trying to &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy through money supply growth and further borrowing via artificially low interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Polleit, &quot;[http://mises.org/story/2810 Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster]&quot;, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, many Austrian School economists support the abolition of the central banks and the fractional-reserve banking system, and advocate instead a return to money based on the [[gold standard]], or less frequently, [[free banking]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises Institute, &quot;[http://mises.org/books/goldstandard.pdf The Gold Standard]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Paul, &quot;[http://mises.org/books/caseforgold.pdf The Case for Gold]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Money could only be created by finding and putting into circulation more gold under a gold standard.

At the beginning of his career Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], was also a strong advocate of the Gold Standard as a protector of economic liberty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold. If everyone decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods, bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government-created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves.

This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.321gold.com/fed/greenspan/1966.html |title=Gold and Economic Freedom |accessdate=2008-09-20 |last=Greenspan |first=Alan |year=1966 |work=The Objectivist }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Advocates argued that the Gold Standard would constrain unsustainable and volatile fractional-reserve banking practices, ensuring that money supply growth (&quot;inflation&quot;) would never spiral out of control.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, &quot;[http://mises.org/rothbard/100percent.pdf The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises Institute, &quot;[http://mises.org/story/2870 Money, Banking and the Federal Reserve]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig von Mises asserted that civil liberties would be better protected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of [[sound money]] if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights. The demand for constitutional guarantees and for bills of rights was a reaction against arbitrary rule and the nonobservance of old customs by kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Mises |first=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |coauthors= |title=The Theory of Money and Credit |publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc. |date=1981-07-01 |location= |pages=Chapter 21 |url=http://mises.org/story/2276 |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-913966-71-6 |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian theory of the business cycle varies significantly from mainstream theories. Economists such as [[Gordon Tullock]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tullock1988&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gordon Tullock |title=Why the Austrians are wrong about depressions |journal=The Review of Austrian Economics |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=73–78 |format=PDF |url=http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE2_1_4.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-24 |doi=10.1007/BF01539299 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Caplan]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/01/whats_wrong_wit_6.html |title=What's Wrong With Austrian Business Cycle Theory |last=Caplan |first=Bryan |date=2008-01-02 |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nobel laureates Milton Friedman&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman1969&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Optimal Quantity of Money and Other Essays |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |pages=261–284 |chapter=The Monetary Studies of the National Bureau, 44th Annual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman93&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The 'Plucking Model' of Business Fluctuations Revisited |journal=Economic Inquiry |pages=171–177 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Krugman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/9593 |title=The Hangover Theory |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=1998-12-04 |publisher=Slate |accessdate=2008-06-20| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5u40jRL5e | archivedate = 2010-11-07| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; have said that they regard the theory as incorrect.

In contrast to most mainstream theories on business cycles, Austrian School economists focus on the credit cycle as the primary cause of most business cycles.  Austrian economists assert that inherently damaging and ineffective central bank policies are the predominant cause of most business cycles, as they tend to set &quot;artificial&quot; interest rates too low for too long, resulting in excessive credit creation, speculative &quot;[[economic bubble|bubbles]]&quot; and &quot;artificially&quot; low savings.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Polleit, [http://mises.org/story/2810 Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster], 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Austrian School business cycle theory, the business cycle unfolds in the following way. Low interest rates tend to stimulate borrowing from the banking system. This expansion of credit causes an expansion of the supply of money, through the [[money creation]] process in a fractional reserve banking system. This in turn leads to an unsustainable &quot;credit-fuelled boom&quot; during which the &quot;artificially stimulated&quot; borrowing seeks out diminishing investment opportunities. This boom results in widespread malinvestments, causing [[capital (economics)|capital]] resources to be misallocated into areas which would not attract investment if the money supply remained stable.

Economist [[Steve H. Hanke]] identifies the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|2007-2010 Global Financial Crises]] as the direct outcome of the Federal Reserve Bank's interest rate policies as is predicted by Austrian school economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10100  |title=The Fed's Modus Operandi: Panic | Cato Institute: Commentary |first=Steve H. |last=Hanke  |work=cato.org  |accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts such as [[Jerry Tempelman]] have also argued that the predictive and explanatory power of ABCT in relation to the Global Financial Crisis has reaffirmed its status and, perhaps, cast into question the utility of mainstream theories and critiques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae13_1_1.pdf ABCT and the GFC: Confessions of a Mainstream Economist] by Jerry Tempelman&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian School economists argue that a correction or &quot;[[credit crunch]]&quot; – commonly called a &quot;recession&quot; or &quot;bust&quot; – occurs when credit creation cannot be sustained. They claim that the money supply suddenly and sharply contracts when markets finally &quot;clear&quot;, causing resources to be reallocated back toward more efficient uses.

==Criticism of the Austrian School==
Critics have concluded that modern Austrian economics generally lacks scientific rigor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The research program of Austrian economics |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |first=Lawrence H. |last=White |journal=Advances in Austrian Economics |year=2008 |page=20 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which forms the basis of the most prominent criticism of the school. Austrian theories are not formulated in formal mathematical form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |first=Deborah L.   |last=Walker  |title=Austrian Economics  |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty  |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/AustrianEconomics.html  |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by using mainly verbal logic and what proponents claim are self-evident axioms. Mainstream economists believe that this makes Austrian theories too imprecisely defined to be clearly used to explain or predict real world events. Economist [[Bryan Caplan]] noted that, &quot;what prevents Austrian economists from getting more publications in mainstream journals is that their papers rarely use mathematics or econometrics.&quot;

A related criticism&lt;ref name=&quot;tremble&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Mayer |title=Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response   |publisher=Routledge |journal=Critical Review |month=Winter |year=1998 |pages=151–171 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; is applied to Austrian School leaders; these leaders have advocated a rejection of [[Scientific method#Characterizations|methods]] which involve directly using empirical data in the development of (falsifiable) [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]]; application of empirical data is fundamental to the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]&quot;, {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794–6 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Austrian School leader, Ludwig von Mises, has been described as the mid-20th century's &quot;archetypal 'unscientific' economist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BC1&quot;/&gt;  Mises wrote of [[praxeology|his economic methodology]] that &quot;its statements and propositions are not derived from experience... They are not subject to verification or falsification on the ground of experience and facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Action: A Treatise on Economics |publisher=Laissez Faire Books |first=Ludwig |last=von Mises |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-930073-18-3 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Rothbard was also an adherent of Mises's methodology, and though Rothbard assigned a quasi-empirical description to it, he comments that &quot;it should be obvious that this type of 'empiricism' is so out of step with modern empiricism that I may just as well continue to call it ''a priori'' for present purposes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=In Defense of “Extreme Apriorism” |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Limited |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |year=1991 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the prominent Austrian economist, F. A. Hayek, stated his belief that social science theories can &quot;never be verified or falsified by reference to facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Individualism and Economic Order |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |first=Friedrich August  |last=Hayek |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-226-32093-9 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such rejections of empirical evidence in economics by Austrian School leaders have led to the school being dismissed within the mainstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;tremble&quot; /&gt;

Another general criticism of the School is that although it claims to highlight shortcomings in traditional methodology, it fails to provide viable alternatives for making positive contributions to economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, B. 1975. &quot;Book review: Competition and entrepreneurship&quot;. ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''. 83: 1305–1306.&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of Austrian economics, Caplan stated that Austrian economists have often misunderstood modern economics, causing them to overstate their differences with it. He argued that several of the most important Austrian claims are false or overstated. For example, Austrian economists object to the use of [[cardinal utility]] in [[microeconomic]] theory; however, microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results hold for all [[monotonic]] transformations of utility, and so are true for purely [[ordinal utility|ordinal preferences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_ord&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_journal&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caplan has also criticized the school for rejecting on principle the use of mathematics or econometrics.

There are also criticisms of specific Austrian theories. For example, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, after examining the history of business cycles in the US, concluded that &quot;The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence. It is, I believe, false.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Optimal Quantity of Money and Other Essays |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |pages=261–284 |chapter=The Monetary Studies of the National Bureau, 44th Annual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=The 'Plucking Model' of Business Fluctuations Revisited|journal=Economic Inquiry|pages=171–177|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman_ABCT_false&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Optimal Quantity of Money and Other Essays |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |pages=261–284 |chapter=The Monetary Studies of the National Bureau, 44th Annual Report | quote=The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence. It is, I believe, false. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Milton Friedman's criticism, Nobel laureate and neo-Keynesian economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued that Austrian business cycle theory implies that consumption would increase during downturns, and cannot explain the empirical observation that spending in ''all sectors'' of the economy fall during a recession.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/9593 |title=The Hangover Theory |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=1998-12-04 |publisher=Slate |accessdate=2008-06-20| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5u40jRL5e | archivedate = 2010-11-07| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] has pointed out that when comparing developed free-market economies, those that have high rates of taxation and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low rates of taxation and low social outlays. He asserts that poverty rates are lower, median income is higher, the budget has larger surpluses, and the trade balance is stronger (although unemployment tends to be higher). He concludes that Friedrich Hayek was wrong when he said that high taxation would be a threat to freedom; but rather, a generous social-welfare state leads to fairness, economic equality, international competitiveness, and strong vibrant democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Social Welfare State, Beyond Ideology |last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey |date = October 2006|journal=Scientific American |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-social-welfare-state |accessdate=2008-06-20|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Sachs' article, [[William Easterly]] states that Hayek, writing in 1944, correctly recognized the dangers of large-scale state economic planning. He also questions the validity of comparing poverty levels in the Nordic countries and the United States, when the former have been moving away from social planning toward a more market-based economy, and the latter has historically taken in impoverished immigrants. Easterly also argues that laissez-faire countries were the leaders of &quot;the ongoing global industrial revolution&quot; which is responsible for abolishing much of the world's poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116355956112023480.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries|title=Dismal Science|accessdate=2008-09-07|author=[[William Easterly]]

An '''abscess''' ({{Lang-lat|abscessus}}) is a collection of [[pus]] (dead [[neutrophils]]) that has accumulated in a cavity formed by the tissue in which the pus resides on the basis of an [[infection|infectious]] process (usually caused by [[bacteria]] or [[parasite]]s) or other foreign materials (e.g., splinters, bullet wounds, or injecting needles). It is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body. One example of an abscess is a [[BCG-oma]], which is caused because of incorrect administration of the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] vaccine. 

The organisms or foreign materials kill the local [[cell (biology)|cells]], resulting in the release of [[cytokine]]s.  The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional [[blood]] flow.

The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep   the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.

Abscesses must be differentiated from [[empyema]]s, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.

==Signs and symptoms==
The cardinal symptoms and signs of any kind of inflammatory process are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules ([[boil]]s) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, [[brain abscess|brain]], [[Tooth abscess|teeth]], kidneys and tonsils.  Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death ([[gangrene]]).  Abscesses in most parts of the body rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated at the first suspicion of an abscess.
An abscess could potentially be fatal (although this is rare) if it compresses vital structures such as the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] in the context of a deep neck abscess.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Treatment==
Wound abscesses cannot be treated with antibiotics. They require surgical intervention, [[debridement]] and [[curettage]] (Ubi pus, ibi evacua. Hippocrates).&lt;ref&gt;McLatchie G, Leaper D, (eds). 2007. Oxford Handbook of Clinical Surgery, 2nd ed. Oxford. OUP&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incision and drainage===
{{main|Incision and drainage}}
[[Image:Cleaned abscess day 5.jpg|thumb|right|Abscess five days after incision and drainage.]]
The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal. If foreign objects are not the cause, a doctor will incise and drain the abscess and prescribe painkillers and possibly antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surgery: Facts and Figures |last=Green |first=James |coauthors=Saj Wajed |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 1-900151-96-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surgery|Surgical]] drainage of the abscess (e.g., [[Incision and drainage|lancing]]) is usually indicated once the abscess has developed from a harder [[serous]] inflammation to a softer [[pus]] stage. This is expressed in the [[Latin]] medical [[aphorism]]: ''[[Ubi pus, ibi evacua]]''.

In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.

===Packing===
In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed. However, there is no evidence to support this practice and it may in fact delay healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=272 |title=BestBets: abscesses; to pack or not to pack |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To try to answer this question more definitely, a randomized double-blind study was started in September 2008 and was completed in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00746109 |title=Study of Wound Packing After Superficial Skin Abscess Drainage - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interim analysis of data from this study suggests that &quot;wound packing may significantly increase the failure rates.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aap.confex.com/aap/2009/webprogram/Paper5982.html |title=Randomized Clinical Trial of Packing Following Incision and Drainage of Superficial Skin Abscesses in the Pediatric Emergency Department |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small pilot study has found no benefit from packing of simple cutaneous abscesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Malley GF, Dominici P, Giraldo P, ''et al.'' |title=Routine Packing of Simple Cutaneous Abscesses Is Painful and Probably Unnecessary |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume= 16|issue= 5|pages= 470–3|year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19388915 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00409.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary closure===
Primary closure has been successful when combined with [[curettage]] and [[antibiotics]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9137156&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abraham N, Doudle M, Carson P |title=Open versus closed surgical treatment of abscesses: a controlled clinical trial |journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=173–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9137156 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.1997.tb01934.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with curettage alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3881155&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stewart MP, Laing MR, Krukowski ZH |title=Treatment of acute abscesses by incision, curettage and primary suture without antibiotics: a controlled clinical trial |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=66–7 |year=1985 |pmid=3881155 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800720125}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another [[randomized controlled trial]] found primary closure led to 35% failing to heal primarily and primary closure longer median number of days to closure (8.9 versus 7.8).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6805714&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simms MH, Curran F, Johnson RA, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of acute abscesses in the casualty department |journal=British medical journal (Clinical research ed.) |volume=284 |issue=6332 |pages=1827–9 |year=1982 |pmid=6805714 |doi=10.1136/bmj.284.6332.1827 |pmc=1498721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anorectal abscesses, primary closure healed faster, but 25% of abscesses [[Wound healing|healed by secondary intention]] and recurrence was higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6397949&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kronborg O, Olsen H |title=Incision and drainage v. incision, curettage and suture under antibiotic cover in anorectal abscess. A randomized study with 4-year follow-up |journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica |volume=150 |issue=8 |pages=689–92 |year=1984 |pmid=6397949 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibiotics===
As ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[bacteria]] is a common cause, an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used.  With the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [[MRSA]], these traditional antibiotics may be ineffective; alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], and [[doxycycline]]. These antibiotics may also be prescribed to patients with a documented allergy to penicillin. (If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin). It is important to note that [[antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels. Whilst most medical texts advocate surgical incision some medical doctors will treat small abscesses conservatively with antibiotics.

===Recurrent infections===
Recurrent abscesses are often caused by community-acquired [[MRSA]]. While resistant to most beta lactam antibiotics commonly used for skin infections, it remains sensitive to alternative antibiotics, e.g., clindamycin (Cleocin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), and doxycycline (unlike hospital-acquired MRSA that may only be sensitive to vancomycin IV).

To prevent recurrent infections due to ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', consider the following measures:
*Topical [[mupirocin]] applied to the [[nares]].&lt;ref name=Raz1996&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raz R, Miron D, Colodner R, Staler Z, Samara Z, Keness Y | title = A 1-year trial of nasal mupirocin in the prevention of recurrent staphylococcal nasal colonization and skin infection | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 156 | issue = 10 | pages = 1109–12 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8638999 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.156.10.1109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[randomized controlled trial]], patients used nasal mupirocin twice daily 5 days a month for 1 year.
*[[Chlorhexidine]] baths,&lt;ref name=Watanakunakorn&gt;{{cite journal | author = Watanakunakorn C, Axelson C, Bota B, Stahl C | title = Mupirocin ointment with and without chlorhexidine baths in the eradication of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in nursing home residents | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 306–9 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8585642 | doi = 10.1016/0196-6553(95)90061-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[randomized controlled trial]], nasal recolonization with S. aureus occurred at 12 weeks in 24% of nursing home residents receiving mupirocin ointment alone (6/25) and in 15% of residents receiving mupirocin ointment plus chlorhexidine baths daily for the first three days of mupirocin treatment (4/27). Although these results did not reach [[statistical significance]], the baths are an easy treatment.

===Magnesium sulfate paste===
Historically abscesses as well as boils and many other collections of pus have been treated via application of [[magnesium sulfate]] ([[Epsom salt]]) paste. This works by drawing the infected pus to the surface of the skin before rupturing and leaking out. After this the body will usually repair the old infected cavity. Magnesium sulfate is therefore best applied at night with a sterile dressing covering it, the rupture itself is not painful but the drawing up may be uncomfortable. Magnesium sulfate paste is considered a &quot;home remedy&quot; and is not necessarily an effective or accepted medical treatment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Perianal abscess==
[[Perianal abscesses]] can be seen in patients with for example [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (such as [[Crohn's disease]]) or [[diabetes]].  Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration ,hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.

Surgery is needed STAT as some patients may keep defecating over the wound rupturing the large intestine.

Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and debridement or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].

'''Ancient Pueblo People''' or '''Ancestral Pueblo peoples''' were an ancient [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture centered on the present-day [[Four Corners]] area of the [[United States]],  comprising southern [[Utah]], northern [[Arizona]], northwest [[New Mexico]], and southern [[Colorado]]. They lived in &quot;houses&quot; called pueblos in which they lifted up ladders during enemy attacks, providing the Pueblo peoples security. The cultural group has often been referred to in archaeology as the '''Anasazi''', although the term is not preferred by contemporary [[Pueblo peoples]].&lt;ref name=r12&gt;Roberts 12&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Anasází'' is [[Navajo language|Navajo]] for &quot;Ancient Ones&quot; or &quot;Ancient Enemy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNCO&quot; /&gt;  

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] still debate when this distinct [[culture]] emerged.  The current consensus, based on terminology defined by the [[Pecos Classification]], suggests their emergence around the 12th century BCE, during the archaeologically designated [[Pecos Classification#Early Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II Era]]. Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations, researchers postulated that the Ancient Puebloans are ancestors of the modern [[Pueblo people]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNCO&quot;&gt;[http://hewit.unco.edu/DOHIST/puebloan/begin.htm Hewit.unco.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, modern Pueblo people claim these ancient people as their ancestors.

==Etymology==
The name ''pueblo'' was given by Spanish, and means in the Spanish language &quot;village&quot;. The name ''Anasazi'' is an exonym, given by the [[Navajo people]], who now reside in formerly Pueblo territory, and means &quot;ancestral enemies.&quot;&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Anasazi-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Anasazi territory shown in light brown]]
The Ancient Pueblo were one of four major prehistoric archaeological traditions recognized in the American Southwest. The others are the [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]], [[Hohokam]] and [[Patayan]]. In relation to neighboring cultures, the Ancient Pueblo occupied the northeast quadrant of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/People/anasazi.htm The Anasazi or &quot;Ancient Pueblo&quot;] from CP-LUHNA&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Pueblo homeland centers on the [[Colorado Plateau]], but extends from central [[New Mexico]] on the east to southern [[Nevada]] on the west. Areas of southern Nevada, [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]] form a loose northern boundary, while the southern edge is defined by the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and [[Little Colorado River|Little Colorado rivers]] in [[Arizona]] and the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] and [[Rio Grande]] in New Mexico. However, structures and other evidence of Ancient Pueblo culture has been found extending east onto the American [[Great Plains]], in areas near the [[Cimarron River (Arkansas River)|Cimarron]] and [[Pecos river]]s and in the [[Galisteo Basin]].

[[Terrain]] and resources within this massive region vary greatly. The [[plateau]] regions are generally high, with elevations ranging from 4500 to {{convert|8500|ft|m}}. Extensive horizontal [[mesa]]s are capped by sedimentary formations and support woodlands of [[juniper]]s, [[Pinyon pine|pinon]], [[ponderosa pines]], and yellow pines, each favoring different elevations. Wind and water erosion have created steep walled canyons, and sculpted windows and bridges out of the [[sandstone]] landscape. In areas where erosionally resistant strata (sedimentary rock layers) such as sandstone or [[limestone]] overlie more easily eroded strata such as shale, rock overhangs formed. These overhangs were favored sites for shelters and building sites. All areas of the Ancient Pueblo homeland suffered from periods of drought and wind and water erosion. Summer rains could be undependable and often arrived in destructive thunderstorms. While the amount of winter snowfall varied greatly, the Ancient Pueblo depended on the snow for most of their water. Snow melt allowed the germination of seeds, both wild and cultivated, in the spring. Where sandstone layers overlay shale, snow melt could accumulate and create seeps and springs, which the Ancient Pueblo used as water sources. Snow also fed the smaller, more predictable tributaries, such as the Chinle, Animas, Jemez and Taos rivers. The larger rivers were less important to the ancient culture, as smaller streams were more easily diverted or controlled for irrigation.

The Ancient Pueblo culture is perhaps best-known for the stone and [[adobe]] dwellings built along cliff walls, particularly during the [[Pecos Classification#Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II]] and [[Pecos Classification#Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] eras.  Adobe structures are constructed with bricks created from sand, clay, and water, with some fibrous or organic material, shaped using frames and dried in the sun.  The best-preserved examples of the stone and adobe dwellings are in [[National Parks]] (USA), such as Chaco Canyon or [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Aztec Ruins National Monument]], [[Bandelier National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], and [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument]]. These villages, called ''[[pueblos]]'' by Spanish settlers, were often only accessible by rope or through rock climbing.  These astonishing building achievements had more modest beginnings. The first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pit-house, a common feature in the Basketmaker periods.

Ancestral Puebloans are also known for their pottery. In general, pottery ware used for cooking or storage in the region was unpainted gray, either smooth or textured. In the northern or &quot;Anasazi&quot; portion of the Ancestral Pueblo world, from about 500 to 1300 CE, the most common decorated pottery had black painted designs on white or light gray backgrounds.  Decoration is characterized by fine hatching, and contrasting colors are produced by the use of mineral-based paint on a chalky background.  Some tall cylinders are considered ceremonial vessels, while narrow-necked jars may have been used for liquids.  Ware in the southern portion of the region, particularly after 1150 CE, is characterized by heavier black-line decoration and the use of carbon-based colorants.&lt;ref&gt;Cordell, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In northern New Mexico, the local &quot;[[black on white]]&quot; tradition, the [[Rio Grande white wares]], continued well after 1300 CE.  

Changes in pottery composition, structure and decoration are signals of social change in the archaeological record.  This is particularly true as the peoples of the American Southwest began to leave their traditional homes and migrate south.  According to archaeologists Patricia Crown and Steadman Upham, the appearance of the bright colors on Salada Polychromes in the 14th century may reflect religious or political alliances on a regional level.  Late 14th and 15th century pottery from central Arizona, widely traded in the region, has colors and designs which may derive from earlier ware by both Anasazi and Mogollon peoples. (Cordell, p.&amp;nbsp;142-143) 

The Ancestral Puebloans also created many [[petroglyphs]] and [[pictographs]].

== Architecture - Pueblo complexes and Great Houses ==

[[File:Bandelier multi-story dwelling.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A Remains of multistory dwelling built into volcanic tuff wall. Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico|Multistory dwellings at Bandelier. Rock wall foundations and beam holes and &quot;cavates&quot; carved into volcanic [[tuff]] remain from upper floors.]]

The Ancestral Puebloan People crafted a unique architecture with planned community spaces. The ancient population centers such as Chaco Canyon (outside Crownpoint, NM), Mesa Verde (outside Cortez, CO), and Bandelier (outside Los Alamos, NM) for which the Ancestral Puebloans are renowned, consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local material, or were carved into the sides of canyon walls. Each were influenced by themselves and design details from other cultures as far away as modern-day Mexico. In their day, these ancient towns and cities were usually multi-storied and multi-purposed buildings surrounding open plazas and viewsheds and were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Puebloan People. These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadways.

Constructed well before 1492 CE, these Ancestral Puebloan towns and villages in the Southwestern U.S. were located in various defensive positions, for example, on high steep mesas such as at Mesa Verde or present-day Acoma &quot;Sky City&quot; Pueblo, in New Mexico. Earlier than 900 CE progressing past the 13th century, the population complexes were a major center of culture for the Ancient Pueblo Peoples. In Chaco Canyon, Chacoan developers quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling 15 major complexes which remained the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strutin_1994_6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Strutin|1994|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fagan_2005_35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed, with the Sun Dagger petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fagan_1998_177-182&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|1998|pp=177–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sofaer_1997&quot;/&gt; Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a 50-year drought in 1130.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fagan_2005_198&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Houses ===

[[File:CasaRinconada.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A partly overcast sky and subdued sunlight over a roughly six-foot tall wall of dusky tan sandstone bricks which vary somewhat in size. The wall runs diagonally from the immediate foreground at left towards the right, running perhaps several dozen feet to the near middle distance. A few feet to the right, in the middle foreground, a low ring of similar blocks delimits a circular pit sunk into the ground. The remains of several other ruinous low walls, perhaps one to three high at most, are arrayed in parallel; they align left to right from the high diagonal wall. Perhaps a mile distant to the center and right, a canyon wall slopes gradually level to meet the valley floor on which the walls sit.|Casa Rinconada]]

Immense complexes known as &quot;Great Houses&quot; embodied worship at Chaco. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sofaer_1997&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sofaer|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Anasazi works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. Houses generally faced the south, and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo's rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas.

The entrance reveals a view of another similar wall, itself bearing a doorway showing yet another wall with another door. Four such nested sets of doorways are seen, with a fifth wall visible through the final fourth doorway.|Doorways, Pueblo Bonito]]

Ceremonial structures known as ''[[kiva]]s'' were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small ''kiva'' was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized Great Kiva, each up to {{convert|63|ft}} in diameter. T-shaped doorways and stone [[lintel]]s marked all Chacoan kivas. Though simple and compound walls were often used, Great Houses were primarily constructed of [[core-and-veneer]] walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat [[sandstone]] blocks bound in [[clay]] mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with [[rubble]], forming the wall's core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding [[mud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fagan_2005_119-121&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2005|pp=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauled—on foot—from mountain ranges up to {{convert|70|mi}} away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sofaer_1999&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sofaer|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kantner&quot;&gt;Kantner, John (2004). &quot;Ancient Puebloan Southwest&quot;, pp. 161-66&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremonial Infrastructure - Great North Road: the thirty foot wide highway ==

One of the most fascinating and intriguing aspects of Ancestral Puebloan infrastructure is at Chaco Canyon and is the Chaco Road, a system of roads radiating out from many great house sites such as Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl and Una Vida, and leading towards small outlier sites and natural features within and beyond the canyon limits.

Through satellite images and ground investigations, archaeologists have detected at least 8 main roads that together run for more than 180 miles (ca 300&amp;nbsp;km), and are more than 30 feet (10 m) wide. These were excavated into a smooth leveled surface in the bedrock or created through the removal of vegetation and soil. The Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) residents of Chaco Canyon cut large ramps and stairways into the cliff rock to connect the roadways on the ridgetops of the canyon to the sites on the valley bottoms.

The largest roads, constructed at the same time as many of the great house sites (between 1000 and 1125 CE), are: the Great North Road, the South Road, the Coyote Canyon Road, the Chacra Face Road, Ahshislepah Road, Mexican Springs Road, the West Road and the shorter Pintado-Chaco Road. Simple structures like berms and walls are found sometimes aligned along the courses of the roads. Also, some tracts of the roads lead to natural features such as springs, lakes, mountain tops and pinnacles.

===The Great North Road===
The longest and most famous of these roads is the Great North Road. The Great North Road originates from different routes close to Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. These roads converge at Pueblo Alto and from there lead north beyond the Canyon limits. There are no communities along the road's course, apart from small, isolated structures.

Archaeological interpretations of the Chaco road system are divided between an economic purpose and a symbolic, ideological role linked to ancestral Puebloan beliefs.

The system was first discovered at the end of the 19th century, and first excavated and studied in the 1970s. Archaeologists suggested that the road's main purpose was to transport local and exotic goods inside and outside the canyon. Someone also suggested that these large roads were used to quickly move an army from the canyon to the outlier communities, a purpose similar to the road systems known for the Roman empire. This last scenario has long been discarded because of the lack of any evidence of a permanent army.

The economic purpose of the Chaco road system is shown by the presence of luxury items at Pueblo Bonito and elsewhere in the canyon. Items such as macaws, turquoise, marine shells, and imported vessels prove the long-distance commercial relations Chaco had with other regions. A further suggestion is that the widespread use of timber in Chacoan constructions—a resource not locally available—needed a large and easy transportation system. Through analysis of various [[strontium]] isotopes, archaeologists have realized that much of the timber that composes Chacoan construction came from a number of distant mountain ranges, indicative also of the Chaco Road's economic significance.

=== Ancient Religion and Road Building ===
Chaco Road Religious Significance:
Other archaeologists think instead that the main purpose of the road system was a religious one, providing pathways for periodic pilgrimages and facilitating regional gatherings for seasonal ceremonies. Furthermore, considering that some of these roads seem to go nowhere, experts suggest that they can be linked—especially the Great North Road—to astronomical observations, solstice marking, and agricultural cycles.

This religious explanation is supported by modern Pueblo beliefs about a North Road leading to their place of origin and along which the spirits of the dead travel. According to modern pueblo people, this road represents the connection to the shipapu, the place of emergence of the ancestors or a dimensional doorway. During their journey from the shipapu to the world of the living, the spirits stop along the road and eat the food left for them by the living.

What Archaeology tells us About the Chaco Road:
Astronomy certainly played an important role in Chaco culture, as it is visible in the north-south axis alignment of many ceremonial structures. The main buildings at Pueblo Bonito, for example, are arranged according to this direction and probably served as central places for ceremonial journeys across the landscape.

Sparse concentrations of ceramic fragments along the North Road have been related to some sort of ritual activities carried out along the roadway. Isolated structures located on the roadsides as well as on top of the canyon cliffs and ridge crests have been interpreted as shrines related to these activities.

Finally, features such as long linear grooves were cut into the bedrock along certain roads which do not seem to point to a specific direction. It has been proposed that these were part of pilgrimage paths followed during ritual ceremonies.

Archaeologists agree that the purpose of this road system may have changed through time and that the Chaco Road system probably functioned for both economic and ideological reasons. Its significance for archaeology lies in the possibility to understand the rich and sophisticated cultural expression of ancestral Puebloan societies.

== Cliff Palace Communities and design ==
[[Image:Cyark Mesa Verde Spruce.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of entire Spruce Tree House from above, cut from a [[3D scanner|Laser scan]]]]

Through out the southwest Ancient Puebloan region and at Mesa Verde, the best known site for these large number of well preserved ''cliff dwellings'', housing, defensive and storage complexes were built in shallow [[caves]] and under rock overhangs along [[canyon]] walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard [[sandstone]], held together and plastered with [[adobe]] mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities, but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.

While much of the construction in these sites conforms to common Pueblo architectural forms, including [[Kivas]], towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built right up against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could and no areas were considered off-limits to construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;kantner&quot;/&gt;

Not all of the people in the region lived in cliff dwellings; many colonized the canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;kantner&quot;/&gt;  Decorative motifs for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both cliff dwellings and non-, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, such as Stephen Lekson (1999), as evidence of the continuing reach of the [[Chaco Canyon]] elite system, which had seemingly collapsed around a century before.&lt;ref&gt;Lekson, Stephen (1999). &quot;The Chaco Meridian: centers of Political Power in the Ancient Southwest&quot;. Walnut Creek, Altamira Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers see these motifs as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, [http://www.unm.edu/~dap/meridian/meridian.html &quot;The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis&quot;] paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural development==
===Origins===
The period from 700-1130 CE saw a rapid increase in population due to consistent and regular rainfall patterns. Studies of skeletal remains show that this growth was due to increased fertility rather than decreased mortality. However, this tenfold increase in population over the course of a few generations could not be achieved by increased birthrate alone; likely it also involved migrations of peoples from surrounding areas. Innovations such as pottery, food storage, and agriculture enabled this rapid growth. Over several decades, the Ancient Pueblo culture spread across the landscape. Ancient Pueblo culture has been divided into three main areas or branches, based on geographical location: [[Chaco Canyon]] (northwest New Mexico), [[Kayenta]] (northeast Arizona), and Northern San Juan (or [[Mesa Verde]]) (southwest Colorado).

Modern Pueblo oral traditions hold that the Pueblo originated to the north of their current settlements, from [[sipapu|Shibapu]], where they emerged from the underworld. For unknown ages they were led by war chiefs guided by the Spirits across North America. They settled first in the Ancient Pueblo areas for a few hundred years, then migrated to their current location.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Migration from the homeland===
[[Image:Dark Canyon Ruin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ancestral Puebloan ruins in [[Dark Canyon Wilderness]], Utah]]
It is not entirely clear why the Ancestral Puebloans migrated from their established homes in the 12th and 13th centuries. Factors examined and discussed include global or regional climate change (''cf.'' [[Little Ice Age]]), prolonged periods of drought, cyclical periods of topsoil erosion, environmental degradation, de-forestation, hostility from new arrivals, religious or cultural change, and even influence from Mesoamerican cultures. Many of these possibilities are supported by archaeological evidence.   

Current opinion holds that the Ancestral Puebloans responded to pressure from [[Numic]]-speaking peoples moving onto the Colorado Plateau, as well as climate change that resulted in [[agriculture|agricultural]] failures. The archaeological record indicates that it was not unusual for ancient Pueblo peoples to adapt to climatic change by changing residences and locations.&lt;ref&gt;The first to surmise this was John W. Powell, ''Canyons of the Colorado'', 1895, Flood &amp; Vincent.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Pueblo I sites may have housed up to 600 individuals in a few separate but closely spaced settlement clusters. However, they were generally occupied for a mere 30 years or less. Archaeologist [[Timothy A. Kohler]] excavated large Pueblo I sites near [[Dolores, Colorado]], and discovered that they were established during periods of above-average rainfall. This would allow crops to be grown without benefit of irrigation. At the same time, nearby areas experiencing significantly drier patterns were abandoned.

The ancient Pueblos attained a cultural &quot;Golden Age&quot; between about 900 and 1130. During this time, generally classed as Pueblo II, the climate was relatively warm and rainfall mostly adequate. Communities grew larger and were inhabited for longer periods of time. Highly specific local traditions in architecture and pottery emerged, and trade over long distances appears to have been common. [[Domesticated turkey]]s appear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} 

After approximately 1150, North America experienced significant climatic change in the form of a 300-year drought called the [[Great Drought]].  This also led to the collapse of the [[Tiwanaku]] civilization around [[Lake Titicaca]] in present-day Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/50746;jsessionid=aaa5LVF0  &quot;Mountains of Evidence&quot;], in ''[[American Scientist]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The contemporary [[Mississippian culture]] also collapsed during this period.  Confirming evidence is found in excavations of the western regions of the [[Mississippi Valley]] between 1150 and 1350, which show long-lasting patterns of warmer, wetter winters and cooler, drier summers. In this later period, the Pueblo II became more self-contained, decreasing trade and interaction with more distant communities. Southwest farmers developed irrigation techniques appropriate to seasonal rainfall, including soil and water control features such as check dams and terraces. The population of the region continued to be mobile, abandoning settlements and fields under adverse conditions.  Along with the change in precipitation patterns, there was a drop in water table levels due to a different cycle unrelated to rainfall. This forced the abandonment of settlements in the more arid or over-farmed locations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Evidence suggests a profound change in religion in this period. Chacoan and other structures constructed originally along astronomical alignments, and thought to have served important ceremonial purposes to the culture, were systematically dismantled. Doorways were sealed with rock and mortar. [[Kiva]] walls show marks from great fires set within them, which probably required removal of the massive roof - a task which would require significant effort. Habitations were abandoned, tribes split and divided and resettled far elsewhere. This evidence suggests that the religious structures were deliberately abandoned slowly over time.  Puebloan tradition holds that the ancestors had achieved great spiritual power and control over natural forces, and used their power in ways that caused nature to change, and caused changes that were never meant to occur. Possibly, the dismantling of their religious structures was an effort to symbolically undo the changes they felt they caused due to their abuse of their spiritual power, and thus make amends with nature.

Most modern Pueblo peoples (whether Keresans, [[Hopi]], or Tanoans) assert the ancient Pueblo did not &quot;vanish&quot;, as is commonly portrayed in media presentations or popular books, but migrated to areas in the southwest with more favorable rainfall and dependable streams. They merged into the various Pueblo peoples whose descendants still live in Arizona and New Mexico. This perspective is not new.  It was presented by early 20th century [[anthropologists]], including [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], [[J. Walter Fewkes]] and [[Alfred V. Kidder]]. Many modern Pueblo tribes trace their lineage from settlements. For example, the [[San Ildefonso Pueblo|San Ildefonso Pueblo people]] believe that their ancestors lived in both the Mesa Verde and the Bandelier areas. Evidence also suggests that a profound change took place in the Anasazi area and areas inhabited by their cultural neighbors, the [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]].  The contemporary historian [[James W. Loewen]] agrees with the oral traditions in his book, ''Lies Across America: What Our Historic Markers and Monuments Get Wrong'' (1999), but there is not a consensus within the professional academic community.

===Warfare and cannibalism===
Stress on the environment may have been reflected in the social structure, leading to conflict and warfare. Near [[Kayenta, Arizona]], Jonathan Haas of the Field Museum in Chicago has been studying a group of Ancient Pueblo villages that relocated from the canyons to the high mesa tops during the late 13th century. The only reason Haas can see for a move so far from water and arable land is defense against enemies. He asserts that isolated communities relied on raiding for food and supplies, and that internal conflict and warfare became common in the 13th century. This conflict may have been aggravated by the influx of less settled peoples, Numic-speakers such as the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]s, [[Shoshone]]s and [[Paiute people]], who may have originated in what is today [[California]]. Others suggest that more developed villages, such as that at [[Chaco Canyon]] overstressed their environment, resulting in widespread deforestation and eventually the fall of their civilization through warfare over depleted resources. 

A 1997 excavation at [[Cowboy Wash]] near [[Dolores, Colorado]], found remains of at least twenty-four human skeletons that showed evidence of violence and dismemberment, with strong indications of [[cannibalism]]. This modest community appears to have been abandoned during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;LeBlanc p.174&lt;/ref&gt; Other excavations within the Ancient Pueblo culture area produce varying numbers of unburied, and in some cases dismembered, bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim White (anthropologist)|Tim White]], ''Prehistoric cannibalism at Mancos 5MTUMR-2346'', Princeton, 1992, ISBN 0-691-09467-5&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence of warfare, conflict, and cannibalism is hotly debated by some scholars and interest groups. Suggested alternatives include: a community under the pressure of starvation or extreme social stress, dismemberment and cannibalism as religious ritual or in response to religious conflict, the influx of outsiders seeking to drive out a settled agricultural community via calculated atrocity, or an invasion of a settled region by nomadic raiders who practiced cannibalism; such peoples have existed in other times and places, e.g. the [[Androphagi]] of Europe.

== Anasazi as a cultural label ==
The term &quot;Anasazi&quot; was established in archaeological terminology through the Pecos Classification system in 1927. Archaeologist Linda Cordell discussed the word's etymology and use:
{{bquote|The name &quot;Anasazi&quot; has come to mean &quot;ancient people,&quot; although the word itself is [[Navajo language|Navajo]],  meaning &quot;enemy ancestors.&quot; [The Navajo word is ''anaasází'' (&lt;''anaa-'' &quot;enemy&quot;, ''sází'' &quot;ancestor&quot;).] The term was first applied to ruins of the Mesa Verde by [[Richard Wetherill]], a rancher and trader who, in 1888–1889, was the first Anglo-American to explore the sites in that area. Wetherill knew and worked with Navajos and understood what the word meant. The name was further sanctioned in archaeology when it was adopted by Alfred V. Kidder, the acknowledged dean of Southwestern Archaeology. Kidder felt that it was less cumbersome than a more technical term he might have used. Subsequently some archaeologists who would try to change the term have worried that because the Pueblos speak different languages, there are different words for &quot;ancestor,&quot; and using one might be offensive to people speaking other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Cordell, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some modern Pueblo peoples object to the use of the term ''Anasazi'', although there is still controversy among them on a native alternative. Some modern descendants of this culture often choose to use the term &quot;pueblo peoples&quot;. The modern Hopi use the word &quot;''Hisatsinom''&quot; in preference to Anasazi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidport.com/RefLib/SocialStudies/NativeAmericans/Pueblo.htm Pueblo culture], scroll down&lt;/ref&gt;

David Roberts, in his book &quot;In Search of the Old Ones: Exploring the Anasazi World of the Southwest&quot;, explained his reason for using the term &quot;Anasazi&quot; over a term using &quot;Puebloan&quot;, noting that the latter term &quot;derives from the [[Spanish language|language]] of an oppressor who treated the indigenes of the Southwest far more brutally than the Navajo ever did.&quot;

== Cultural distinctions ==
[[Image:Boy in doorway MVNP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Boy in doorway, Balcony House, [[Mesa Verde National Park]]]]
Archaeological cultural units such as &quot;Anasazi&quot;, [[Hohokam]], [[Patayan]] or Mogollon are used by [[archaeologists]] to define material culture similarities and differences that may identify prehistoric socio-cultural units, equivalent to modern societies or peoples. The names and divisions are classification devices based on theoretical perspectives, analytical methods and data available at the time of analysis and publication. They are subject to change, not only on the basis of new information and discoveries, but also as attitudes and perspectives change within the scientific community. It should not be assumed that an archaeological division or culture unit corresponds to a particular language group or to a socio-political entity such as a tribe. 

When making use of modern cultural divisions in the American Southwest, it is important to comprehend that current terms and conventions have significant limitations:
* Archaeological research focuses on items left behind during people’s activities: fragments of pottery vessels, garbage, human remains, stone tools or evidence left from the construction of dwellings.  However, many other aspects of the culture of prehistoric peoples are not tangible. Their beliefs and behavior are difficult to decipher from physical materials, and their languages remain unknown as they had no known [[writing system]].
* Cultural divisions are tools of the modern scientist, and so should not be considered similar to divisions or relationships the ancient residents may have recognized.  Modern cultures in this region, many of whom claim some of these ancient people as ancestors, contain a striking range of diversity in lifestyles, social organization, language and religious beliefs. This suggests the ancient people were also more diverse than their material remains may suggest.
* The modern term &quot;style&quot; has a bearing on how material items such as pottery or [[architecture]] can be interpreted. Within a people, different means to accomplish the same goal can be adopted by subsets of the larger group. For example, in modern Western cultures, there are alternative styles of [[clothing]] that characterized older and younger generations. Some cultural differences may be based on linear traditions, on teaching from one generation or “school” to another. Other varieties in style may have distinguished between arbitrary groups within a culture, perhaps defining [[Social status|status]], gender, [[clan]] or [[guild]] affiliation, religious belief or cultural alliances. Variations may also simply reflect the different resources available in a given time or area.

Defining cultural groups, such as the Ancient Pueblo peoples, tends to create an image of territories separated by clear-cut boundaries, like border boundaries separating modern states. These simply did not exist. Prehistoric people traded, worshipped, collaborated and fought most often with other nearby groups. Cultural differences should therefore be understood as “clinal”, &quot;increasing gradually as the distance separating groups also increases&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plog, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Departures from the expected pattern may occur because of unidentified social or political situations or because of geographic barriers. In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers and, most obviously, the [[Grand Canyon]] can be significant barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups. Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Ancient Pueblos and their greater differences from the Hohokam and Patayan is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.

'''Aalborg Municipality''' is a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') in [[Region Nordjylland]] on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in northern [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=CVDE&gt;Bridgwater, W. &amp; Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The municipality straddles the [[Limfjord]], the waterway which connects the [[North Sea]] and the [[Kattegat]] east-to-west, and which separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north-to-south. It has a land area of 1,143.99&amp;nbsp;km², population 197,426 (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;FOLK1: Population 1 January&quot;/&gt; and belongs to [[Region Nordjylland]] (&quot;North Jutland Region&quot;).

It is also the name of the municipality's main city [[Aalborg]] and the site of its municipal council, as well as the name of a [[seaport]].  

The municipality and the town have chosen to retain the traditional spelling of the name as ''Aalborg'', although the new spelling ''Ålborg'' is used in other contexts, such as Ålborg [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] (''Ålborg Bugt''), the body of water which lies to the east of the Jutland peninsula.

==Municipal reform of 2007==
As of 1 January 2007 Aalborg municipality joined with the municipalities of [[Hals Municipality|Hals]], [[Nibe]], and [[Sejlflod]] to form a new Aalborg municipality. The former Aalborg municipality, including the island of [[Egholm]], covered an area of {{convert|560|km2|abbr=on}}, with a total population of 192,353 (2005).  Its last mayor was Henning G. Jensen, a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]]. The former municipality was bordered by Sejlflod and Hals to the east, [[Dronninglund]] and [[Brønderslev]] to the north, [[Aabybro]] and Nibe to the west, and [[Støvring]] and [[Skørping]] to the south. It belonged to [[North Jutland County]].

==Geography==
===Surroundings===
The waters in the [[Limfjord]] splitting the municipality are called ''[[Langerak]]'' to the east and ''[[Gjøl Bredning]]'' to the west.  The island of [[Egholm]] is located in ''Gjøl Bredning'', and is connected by [[ferry]] to the city of Aalborg at its southern shore. 

The area is typical for the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake (salt water), with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is [[Store Vildmose]] (&quot;Greater Wild bog&quot;), a swamp where a mirage is sometimes seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar [[Lille Vildmose]] (&quot;Lesser Wild bog&quot;).  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest [[Bog|moor]] in Denmark.

===Urban areas in Aalborg Municipality===
[[Aalborg]] City has a total population at 123,432. The [[metropolitan area]] is a [[conurbation]] of the Aalborg [[urban area]] in [[Himmerland]] (102,312) and the [[Nørresundby]] urban area in [[Vendsyssel]] (21,120).

'''Aarhus''' or '''Århus''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɒːhuːˀs|-|Århus.ogg}}) is the second-largest city in [[Denmark]]. The principal [[port]] of [[Denmark]], Aarhus is on the east side of the peninsula of [[Jutland]] in the geographical center of Denmark. Aarhus is the seat of the council of [[Aarhus municipality]] with 311.222  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk&lt;/ref&gt;. inhabitants and 249,709 (1 January 2011)&lt;ref name=&quot;BEF44&quot;/&gt; in the inner urban area.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_Denmark_by_population&lt;/ref&gt; The city claims the unofficial title &quot;Capital of Jutland&quot;.&lt;ref name=CVDE&gt;Bridgwater, W. &amp; Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus is the main and biggest city in the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]] ({{lang-da|Byregion Østjylland}}), a development concept launched by 17 municipalities in East [[Jutland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vis&quot;&gt;[http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/D57AF934-C471-41E6-A8B0-389AF80A94A6/0/Visionsoplaeg20082008.pdf &quot;Vision Østjylland&quot;], Miljøministeriet, 20. august 2008 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more than 1.2 million people living in the area it represents approximately 23% of the population of Denmark and is the second largest metropolitan area after the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.blst.dk/udgiv/Publikationer/2008/978-87-92256-58-4/html/kap05.htm#5.1 &quot;Danish Befolkningsforhold i Østjylland], Miljøministeriet, august 2008&lt;/ref&gt; however, this area is not a continuously built-up area of today, but includes many rural regions.

==Name==
[[File:AarhusDomkirke.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Aarhus Cathedral]]; rebuilt to its current size in 1500, with the longest [[nave]] in Denmark]]
The city was mentioned for the first time by [[Adam of Bremen]] who stated that &quot;Reginbrand, bishop of the church of Aarhus (Harusa)&quot; participated in a church meeting in the city of [[Ingelheim]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae'' 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic chronicles, it was known as ''Áróss''. It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' (&quot;river&quot;, Modern Danish ''å'') and ''ōss'' (&quot;mouth&quot;, obsolete in Modern Danish; in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for &quot;river delta&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of the stream ''Aarhus Å'' (English: [[Aarhus River]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The Aarhus River&quot;&gt;VisitAarhus (2011). [http://www.visitaarhus.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/om-aarhus/the_history_of_the_city/aarhusaa/aarhusaa.htm The Aarhus River]&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;VisitAarhus (2011). [http://www.visitaarhus.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/om-aarhus/the_history_of_the_city/history_of_the_city.htm History of the city]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Å'' being the Danish word for a small river.&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary (2011). [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A5#Noun å: Noun]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through regular sound development, Medieval Danish ''Arus'' became ''Aars'' or ''Oes'', a form which persisted in the dialects of the surrounding parishes until the 20th century. In 1406, ''Aarhus'' became prevalent in the written sources, and gradually became the norm in the 17th century. ''Aarhus'' is probably a remodelling after the numerous Low German place names in ''-husen'', possibly as a result of the influence of German merchants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Aarhus/Århus spelling===
After the [[Å#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948]] ''Aarhus'' changed name to ''Århus''.

In 2010, a majority of the city council voted for a name change from ''Århus'' back to ''Aarhus'', and the renaming came into effect on January 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;jp.dk (2010). [http://jp.dk/aarhus/politik/article2226754.ece Århus skifter navn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Politiken.dk (2010) [http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE1094748/aarhus-skifter-navn/ Århus skifter navn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Børsen (2010) [http://borsen.dk/nyheder/politik/artikel/1/194315/aarhus_skifter_navn.html Århus skifter navn]&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Nicolai Wammen]] argued that the ''Aa'' spelling would strengthen the city's international profile, help private enterprise and make it easier to access Aarhus on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/48499-arhus-mayor-prefers-aarhus.html|title=Århus mayor prefers Aarhus|date=2010-03-15|newspaper=Copenhagen Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Aarhus'' spelling has, however, always had some use in non-Scandinavian languages. There is considerable opposition to the ''Aa'' spelling and according to a May 2011 poll 59.8 % of the city's inhabitants preferred the ''Å'' spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jp.dk/aarhus/article2421688.ece|title=Dobbelt-a i modvind i Aarhus|date=2011-05-05|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten}} {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many citations of the name on signs and other physical media still read ''Århus'', official informational websites have effectively altered occurrences of ''Århus'' to ''Aarhus''. Furthermore, certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city. An example is the [[Aarhus River]] for which the Danish name has been altered from ''Århus Å'' to ''Aarhus Å''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Aarhus River&quot;/&gt; However, in Danish it is always correct to write geographical names with the letter Å, while local councils since 1984 have been allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative option. When a local authority decides so, most newspapers and state institutions will re-adopt the pre-1948 Aa spelling and the Å spelling will in practice become second-place. However, the official authorities are the [[Danish Placename Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stednavneudvalget.ku.dk/ Danish Placename Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee]], publisher of the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|Danish Orthographic Dictionary]], which will keep ''Århus'' as the main name and have ''Aarhus'' as a new, second option, in brackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsn.dk/nyt/nyheder/2011/aarhus-eller-aarhus|title=Århus eller Aarhus?|year=2011|source=Danish Language Committee}} {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hørning-kirke1.JPG|thumb|left|Interlacing knotwork designs and stylized dragon [[Roof construction#Construction of a ridged roof|ridge plates]] on a reconstruction of an early church at [[Moesgaard Museum]]]]
The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 951, and archaeological findings date back some 1,300 years to [[Viking]] times. The city itself is presumably older than 770 AD, making Aarhus the oldest big city in Scandinavia. The favorable central position of the city within Denmark afforded it trade from [[Germany]], the [[Baltics|Baltic countries]], the greater peninsula of [[Jutland]] and the communities on the many smaller islands in its vicinity, which meant that trade always had a great significance to the town – a significance which is still true today.
[[File:Århus segl 1421 1608 jth.jpg|thumb|right|The Aarhus city seal from 1421 and 1608.]]
The city did not expand outwards until the late 19th century, and [[Aalborg]] remained the largest city on the peninsula until the 1920s. The relatively fast, albeit late, growth of the city can be ascribed to the general tendencies of a population moving from rural to urban areas during the [[industrial revolution]]. Industrialisation meant that proximity to trade routes became more important, giving the harbour city some advantages over other nearby cities as new industries came into existence.

===Viking Age and before===
[[File:Aros viking town.jpg|thumb|150px|fortified Viking Town [[Aros]] (Aarhus) 950 AD]]
[[File:Aroa viking town 1.jpg|thumb|150px|fortified Viking Town [[Aros]]]]
The oldest [[Archaeology|archaeological]] findings in Aarhus are glass pearls, which date to the end of the 7th century. Half buried [[longhouse]]s, used both as homes and workshops for the Vikings have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Skov, &quot;Aros 700–1000&quot;, in: ''Vikingernes Aros'' Århus 2005, 15–39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the houses and the adjoining archaeological layers, combs, jewelry and basic multi-purpose tools have been found that indicate the settlement is from approximately year 900. Digs in the spring of 2005 revealed a so-called city-ditch from the year 850 which might have marked the trade centre upon which the city is built.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The finding of six [[runestone]]s in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around year 1000 as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them.&lt;ref&gt;Gundhild Øeby Nissen, &quot;Runesten&quot;, in: ''Vikingernes Aros'' Århus 2005, 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The center of Aarhus was once a [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of [[Frode]], King of Jutland, around 900.&lt;ref name=VIKINGAROS&gt;Damm, Annette. ''Viking Aros'' (2005) ISBN 87-87334-63-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th–18th centuries===
During the wars of the 17th century, it is probable that the city suffered in a significant way. Fortifications still exist south of the city as a reminder of the [[Germany|German]] imperial campaigns between 1627 and 1629. In 1644, [[Sweden]] taxed the city harshly and between 1657 and 1659, it was occupied by Swedish troops on several occasions. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In spite of these and other misfortunes, such as plague and city-wide fires, Aarhus was still quite a significant city in [[Denmark]] due to its favourable geographical position which was of significant importance for trading. Trade came mainly from the inland of [[Jutland]] but also from [[Norway]], [[Lübeck]], [[Amsterdam]], England, [[France]] and [[Spain]]. In the middle of the 18th century the trade fleet consisted of approximately 100 ships.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===19th century===
In the 19th century, the city gained more independence from the dominance of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Hamburg]]. While it had been the third largest city in Jutland during the early 19th century, its population surpassed [[Randers]] in 1840 and in 1850, [[Ålborg]], thus becoming the largest city in Jutland and the second largest in Denmark.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The city's material prosperity continued to increase as the harbour expanded and the railway network grew. Culturally, it marketed itself as the &quot;Capital of Jutland&quot; and expanded many of its cultural institutions like the national library, universities, the [[Aarhus Theatre]] and hospitals.

==Geography==
&lt;!-- please find photo of the Aarhus Main Railwaystation, and insert it here --&gt;
The city lies roughly at the geographical centre of Denmark on the peninsula of [[Jutland]]. Forests reach from the south into the city to within a kilometre (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) of the city centre, because the city has grown around the forest, and some forest areas are completely surrounded by the city, such as Riis Skov. The city is built mostly around the harbour, which is predominantly industrial, although a large recreational marina is situated south of it as an extension.
[[File:South Aarhus.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Aerial view of Aarhus from the north.]]

While some of the highest points in Denmark are close to the city, the general landscape is typically hilly, interspersed with forests and meadows; the city itself is very hilly north of the centre (by Danish standards, that is; see [[Highest hill, Denmark|Highest hill]], Denmark). The coastline consists mainly of sandy beaches, but stony areas are not uncommon. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The immediate coastal regions are not heavily populated due to a national policy of keeping residences inland rather than crowding the coast. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The city lies at the junction of [[railway]] lines from all parts of the country. To the south west (about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}, by rail) lies a picturesque region that contains the [[Gudenaa|Gudenå]]. Several larger lakes extend West from the [[Skanderborg]] railway junction and rise to heights exceeding {{convert|152|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=off}} at [[Himmelbjerget]]. The railway traverses this district of moorland and woodland to [[Silkeborg]].

===Administrative divisions===
Aarhus is divided into several districts and suburbs with its own postal code (Postdistrikter).

Districts (boroughs) inside the 2nd city beltway:
*[[Aarhus C]]
*[[Aarhus N]]
*[[Aarhus V]]
*[[Aarhus S]]
*[[Åbyhøj]]
*[[Viby J|Viby]]
*[[Brabrand]]
{{Suburbs of Aarhus}}

==Demographics==
More than 300,000 people live within the city limits of Aarhus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.aarhuskommune.dk/m0/struktur05/Befolkning/indexlevel1/indexAldersinddelinger.html Aarhus Kommunes Statistiske Årbog, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; while an additional 500,000 live in the surrounding local area of the [[Jutland|East Jutland]] region.
Aarhus is also a major part of the larger [[East Jutland metropolitan area]] with 1,200,000 inhabitants, which makes East Jutland the second most-populated area in Denmark, after the [[Copenhagen]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/TilSalg/Boghandel/Befolkning.aspx Danmarks Statistik] 2006a {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ojylbu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trafikdage.dk/doks/endeligtpaper/tdpaper107.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fremtidens Byudvikling i Østjylland|year=2007|author=Peter Bro, Ph.D.-studerende, M.Sc., Aalborg Universitet, Henrik Harder, Lektor, Ph.D. HD.O MAA, Aalborg Universitet}} {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the population of Aarhus, 65,000 are under 18 years of age. Aarhus has been growing at a steady rate of about 1% per year since 1950, when the city had about 150,000 inhabitants. [[Aarhus University]] estimates an increase of around 20,000 more students in the next six years, with attendant concerns over a lack of housing. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In response, the city council has already initiated a large range of building projects to house some 100,000 new citizens before 2030 so the city population will rise to almost 400,000 inhabitants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The population of Aarhus is both younger and better-educated than the national average.&lt;ref name=Ojylbu /&gt; This is often attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions and facilities in the area.

Nearly 12% of the population are immigrants, which is high for Denmark, but modest when compared to some other European cities. The largest immigrant groups (January 1, 2008) are Lebanese (4,644), Turks (4,089), Somalis (3,476), Iraqis (3,140), Vietnamese (2,382), and Iranians (2,199). {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} These groups live mainly in the western parts of Aarhus, where the [[Gellerup]] area is infamous for its high concentration of immigrants (88%, 2006). The vast majority of the immigrants in Gellerup are [[Arabs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Somali people|Somalis]]. Other large immigrant groups in Aarhus include Germans (1,573), Poles (1,555), Norwegians (1,050), Afghans (958), and Britons (763).

==Economy==
[[File:Emma Mærsk2.jpg|thumb|360px|right|[[Emma Mærsk]], at the time the world's largest container ship, in Aarhus Harbor, 5 September 2006. Aarhus' central location within Denmark facilitates transport throughout the country and beyond]]&lt;!-- Please find good picture of the harbour here, and insert --&gt;
The harbour is one of the largest industrial harbours in [[Northern Europe]] and the largest in Denmark {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. The facilities are very modern and handle approximately 12 million tonnes of cargo (2006) and are therefore among the 100 biggest containerports in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhushavn.dk/pages/regnskab/XII.htm XII.Godsomsætning], Århus Havn, 2000 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much agricultural produce is exported, while [[coal]] and [[iron]] are among the chief imports. The harbour itself is maintained by [[Århus Stevedore Kompagni A/S]] originally based in Aarhus but currently operating several harbours around the world.

The region is a major producer of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] with many large farms in the outlying districts. Cattle, pork and grain are the main products with a sizable related refinement industry present. Computer and technology heavy industries are mainly focused in the urban areas with an abundance of small and medium sized IT and service companies dotting the city centre. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The [[Ceres Brewery]], part of [[Royal Unibrew]], was originally founded in Aarhus. Royal Unibrew announced the closure of Ceres in 2008.

==Culture==
[[File:DGB2.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Town Open Air Museum; one of two museums in the area, and four in Denmark, with open air displays of period architecture. See [[The Old Town, Aarhus]]]]
Aarhus is a centre for education on the peninsula of [[Jutland]]. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as discothèques, cinemas, museums, amusement parks, and various other entertainment venues . Each year, the town hosts several festivals and concerts, including [[Aarhus International Jazz Festival]] and [[Aarhus Festuge]] the biggest festival in Scandinavia. The [[Vestereng]] park facility is also a site for large popular-music concerts.

One major tourist attraction in Aarhus is [[The Old Town, Aarhus|The Old Town]] ({{lang-da|Den Gamle By}}), which is not actually an old part of the city itself, but a collection of historic Danish buildings gathered from all around the country. The city also hosts the [[Tivoli Friheden]] amusement park as well as the [[Medieval deer park|deer park]] situated in the large nearby public forest.

Architecturally impressive sights include the 13th century [[cathedral]] in the centre of the city; [[Århus Domkirke]] is the tallest cathedral in Denmark, as well as the second tallest in [[Northern Europe]], being only {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}} shorter than its counterpart in [[Trondheim]]. The [[Aarhus City Hall]] is a uniquely designed building drawn by renowned architect [[Arne Jacobsen]], located in the city centre. The city hall is included in the national educational canon for culture as an example of important architectural work.

There are many museums scattered around the city with [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS]] being the newest and largest featuring daily exhibits of contemporary art. Other museums include [[Aarhus Kunstbygning]] also featuring mostly contemporary art, [[Frihedsmuseet]] focusing on the occupation and resistance movement during [[World War II]] and [[Kvindemuseet i Danmark|Kvindemuseet]] mainly showcasing feminist history and culture.

Being a comparatively large Danish city, Aarhus has received a fair share of immigrants from various other cultures and is as such also home to one of the few [[ghetto]]s in Denmark, [[Gellerup]]. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute to many cultural flavours uncommon for the North, such as the [[Arabic]] themed [[Bazar West]], a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.

The city has an active and visible gay and lesbian community which the city officially attempts to promote and nurture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhus.dk/aa/portal/temaer/s_homo Homo i Århus] at ''Aarhus.dk'' {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aarhus Festuge]] festival usually includes several exhibits, concerts or events specifically designed for these communities. There are several clubs, discos and cafes aimed at gays and lesbians: Danish D-lite (sports), G bar(disco) or Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club) are a few examples.

It is common for tourist brochures and local politicians to refer to the town with the tongue-in-cheek slogan &quot;The world's smallest big city&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sologstrand.com/holiday-denmark/djursland-mols.htm Holiday Djursland and Mols]&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the fact that the city has everything a city needs despite not being a metropolis like London. Another popular, and perhaps better known, phrase to describe the city is &quot;City of Smiles&quot; – a slogan first coined by the city council in the 1930s as an advertising slogan, and which subsequently is used widely in popular culture today.

The town is home to [[Aarhus University]], [[Aarhus School of Business]], [[Aarhus Technical College]], [[The Danish School of Journalism]], the [[Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus]], [[VIA University College]] [[Aarhus School of Architecture]], [[KaosPilots]], and the [[Engineering College of Aarhus]] and several other higher education centres. It is possible to receive higher education in many areas, from [[engineering]] and [[dentistry]] to [[language]] and [[theology]].

[[Aarhus University]] has approximately 30,000 students at the university with approximately 5,000 new students per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.dk/da/uddan/okau2005.htm BESTAND AF STUDERENDE, OKTOBER 2005], [[Aarhus Universitet]], November 21, 2005 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The city council consists of 31 members elected for 4-year terms. Anybody eligible to vote and residing in [[Aarhus municipality]] can run for a seat on the city council. After elections have determined the members of the city council, the council elects a mayor, 2 deputy mayors and 5 councilmen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhuskommune.dk/portal/politik/byraad Byråd], [[Aarhus Municipality]], July 15, 2003 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[Mayor]] of Aarhus is [[Nicolai Wammen]] of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] elected by the city council after the 2009 municipal elections.

The city is divided into 6 minor administrative bodies which together constitute the [[magistrate]] led by the mayor and the 5 elected councilmen as political and administrative directors. The 6 magistrate departments of the city are the &quot;Mayor's Magistrate&quot;, &quot;Social and Employment Magistrate&quot;, &quot;Technology and Environment Magistrate&quot;, &quot;Health and Social Magistrate&quot;, &quot;Culture and Service Magistrate&quot; and &quot;Children and Youth Magistrate&quot; and handle all the day-to-day operations of the city.

Aarhus is the seat of [[Aarhus Municipality]]. Until the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which replaced the Danish counties with five regions, it was also the seat of [[Aarhus County]], which has now been disbanded in favor of the new [[Region Midtjylland]], its seat located in [[Viborg County|Viborg]].

Aarhus has twinning agreements with [[Gothenburg]], [[Turku]], [[Bergen]], [[Harbin]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Julianehåb]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhuskommune.dk/portal/english?_page=international.emne/twinned_towns.htm Århus Kommune: Twinned towns]&lt;/ref&gt; and has a connection with [[Swansea]].

==Transport==
[[File:Bycykler i stativ i Århus.jpg|thumb|right|Århus Citybikes.]]
[[Aarhus Airport]], a local airport of Aarhus, is located {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} north-east of Aarhus, in [[Tirstrup]]. The number of available destinations leaving from Aarhus Airport is rapidly increasing because of the rising international interest in the City, but residents also use the bigger [[Billund Airport]], situated {{convert|95|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} south-west of Aarhus. There have been plans for constructing a new, bigger airport for a long time, but so far, the plans have not been realized.

Aarhus is served by commuter rail that connects the city itself with neighbouring towns. The main station in Aarhus is [[Århus Central Station]], which is located in the city centre. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Alle or Banegårdspladsen (lit. English: &quot;Central Station Square&quot;) or both. County and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal which is located 900 meters north-west of Banegårdspladsen, in front of the [[Radisson SAS]] Scandinavia hotel located at Margrethepladsen 1, 8000 Århus C).

The Danish ferry company [[Mols-Linien]] connects Aarhus with [[Copenhagen]] (located on the isle of [[Zealand]]). The fastest ferries in the world (100&amp;nbsp;km/h) operate up to 10 times daily from the port of Aarhus to the port cities of [[Sjællands Odde]] and [[Kalundborg]] on [[Zealand]]. The ferries take both vehicles and the Busline 888, which is the fastest link between the two Danish capitals.

Aarhus also has a free bike sharing system, Århus Bycykler. The bicycles are available from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and can be obtained by placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, just like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the bike is returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhusbycykel.dk/index_eng.html &quot;Århus Bycyckel&quot;]. Retrieved 6 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In Denmark, an &quot;Aarhus story&quot; — similar to a [[Molbo story]] — is a kind of derogatory [[ethnic joke]]. Such stories about the citizens of Aarhus began in the early 20th century and the term continues to be used colloquially. For example, one popular Aarhus story goes as follows. &quot;Have you heard about the Aarhus citizen who was leafing through a phonebook and remarked: 'Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen... How many phones does this guy have?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;H.A. Yearhouse, &quot;De første 59 Aarhus-historier&quot;, Chr. Erichsens Forlag 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''amateur''' ([[French language|French]] ''amateur'' &quot;lover of&quot;, from Old French and ultimately from Latin amatorem nom. amator, &quot;lover&quot;) is generally considered a person attached to a particular pursuit, study, or science, without pay and often without formal training.
Amateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often do not have formal training, some amateur work may be sub-par. For example, [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]] in sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]] or [[Football games|football]] are regarded as having a lower level of ability than professional athletes. On the other hand, an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.

The lack of financial benefit can also be seen as a sign of [[commitment]] to an activity; and until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs. Receiving payment to participate in an event disqualified an athlete from that event, as in the case of [[Jim Thorpe]]. In the Olympics, this rule remains in place for [[boxing]].

Many amateurs make valuable contributions in the field of [[computer programming]] through the [[open source]] movement{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. [[Amateur dramatics]] is the performance of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] or [[musical theater]], often to high standards but lacking the budgets of professional [[West End theatre|West End]] or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances. [[Astronomy]], history, linguistics, and the natural sciences are among the myriad fields that have benefited from the activities of amateurs.

[[File:Carrel 2405656016 f0c7750012 o.jpg|thumb|Carrel in 1912]]
'''Alexis Carrel''' (June 28, 1873 &amp;ndash; November 5, 1944) was a [[French people|French]] surgeon, biologist and [[eugenicist]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1912. He is also known for being accused of collaboration with the [[Nazis]] and the implementation of the [[eugenics]] policies of [[Vichy France]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fh.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/365.extract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://uh.edu/engines/epi1863.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrés Horacio Reggiani p. 107&quot;&gt;(see Andrés Horacio Reggiani, ''Alexis Carrel, the Unknown: Eugenics and Population Research under Vichy'', as well as Caillois, p. 107)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon]] , [[Rhône (department)|Rhône]], Carrel received his medical degree from [[Université de Lyon]], and practiced in France and in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]]. He developed new techniques in [[Blood vessel|vascular]] sutures and was a pioneer in [[transplantology]] and [[thoracic surgery]]. Alexis Carrel was also a member of [[learned societies]] in the U.S., Spain, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]], [[Princeton University]], California, New York, [[Brown University]] and [[Columbia University]]. He collaborated with American physician [[Charles Claude Guthrie]] in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the [[head transplant|head]], and Carrel was awarded the 1912 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for these efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1912/index.html Nobelprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his close proximity with [[Jacques Doriot]]'s fascist [[Parti Populaire Français]] (PPF) during the 1930s and his role in implementing eugenics policies during Vichy France, he was accused after the Liberation of collaborationism, but died before the trial.

== Contributions to science ==
=== Vascular suture ===
Carrel was a young surgeon in 1894 when the French president [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was assassinated with a knife. His large abdominal veins had been severed, and surgeons who treated the president felt that such veins were too large to be successfully reconnected. This left a deep impression on Carrel, and he set about developing new techniques for suturing blood vessels. The technique of &quot;triangulation&quot;, which was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroideress, is still used today. Julius Comroe wrote: &quot;Between 1901 and 1910, Alexis Carrel, using experimental animals, performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today.&quot; He had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins, and performing surgical grafts, and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912.&lt;ref name=simmons&gt;{{Cite document | year=2002 | title = Doctors and discoveries: lives that created today's medicine | author1=John G. Simmons | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | isbn=9780618152766 | pages=199–204 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=PD2-gpsoh8kC&amp;pg=PA199 | date=2002 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wound antisepsis ===

During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), Carrel and the English chemist [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]] developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds based on chlorine (Dakin's solution) which, preceding the development of [[antibiotics]], was a major medical advance in the care of traumatic wounds. For this, Carrel was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]].

=== Organ transplants ===
Carrel co-authored a book with famed pilot [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], ''The Culture of Organs'', and worked with Lindbergh in the mid-1930s to create the &quot;perfusion pump,&quot; which allowed living organs to exist outside of the body during surgery. The advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of [[open-heart surgery]] and [[organ transplants]], and to have laid the groundwork for the [[artificial heart]], which became a reality decades later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/innovators/bio_carrel2.html Red Gold . Innovators &amp; Pioneers . Alexis Carrel | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of Lindbergh claimed that Carrel overstated Lindbergh's role to gain media attention,&lt;ref&gt;(Wallace, ''American Axis'' p. 101)&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources say Lindbergh played an important role in developing the device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbbnet.umn.edu/doric/lindbergh.html The Doric Column - Lindbergh &amp; Carrel, organ perfusion, tissue culture, transplants, gene therapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/heart The &quot;Lone Eagle's&quot; Contribution to Cardiology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lindbergh and Carrel appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] on June 13, 1938.

=== Cellular senescence ===
Carrel was also interested in the phenomenon of [[senescence]], or aging. He claimed incorrectly that all cells continued to grow indefinitely, and this became a dominant view in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossel2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=UYeUk9m9yeQC&amp;pg=PA24 | title = Cells, Aging, and Human Disease | first = Michael B. | last = Fossel | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 9780195140354 | pages = 504 | date = 2004-06-02 }}; page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrel started an experiment on January 17, 1912 where he placed tissue cultured from an [[embryo]]nic chicken heart in a stoppered [[Pyrex]] flask of his own design.&lt;ref name='JEM-CARREL'&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Permanent Life of Tissues Outside of the Organism|journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine|date=1912-05-01|first=Alexis|last=Carrel|coauthors=|volume=15|issue=5|pages=516–528|id= |url=http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/reprint/15/5/516.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-28|doi=10.1084/jem.15.5.516|pmid=19867545|pmc=2124948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained the living culture for over 20 years with regular supplies of nutrient. This was longer than a chicken's normal lifespan. The experiment, which was conducted at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]], attracted considerable popular and scientific attention.

Carrel's experiment was never successfully replicated, and in the 1960s [[Leonard Hayflick]] and [[Paul Moorhead]] proposed that [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]] can only undergo a limited number of divisions before dying. This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]], and is now a pillar of biology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossel2004&quot;/&gt;

It is not certain how Carrel obtained his anomalous results. [[Leonard Hayflick]] suggests that the daily feeding of nutrient was continually introducing new living cells to the alleged immortal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mortality and Immortality at the Cellular Level.

Witkowski has argued that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Dr. Carrel's immortal cells | first = JA | last = Witkowski | year = 1980 | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 129&amp;ndash;142 | journal = Medical History | pmid = 6990125 | pmc = 1082700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while &quot;immortal&quot; strains of visibly mutated cells have been obtained by other experimenters, a more likely explanation is deliberate introduction of new cells into the culture, possibly without Carrel's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Witkowsky explanation is actually based on the account of a visiting medical researcher, Ralph Buchbaum, who reports being told by a technician in Carrel's lab &quot;Dr. Carrel would be so upset if we lost the strain, we just add a few embryo cells now and then&quot;. After the first six months, Carrel's colleague Albert Ebeling had actually taken charge of the cultures and published several papers about their development, until they were eventually discarded in 1946. Witkowsky, in &quot;Dr. Carrel's immortal cells&quot;, op. cit., quotes Buchbaum's account. At the end Buchbaum writes that &quot;I told this story, of my visit to Carrel's laboratory, to various people. Dr. Bloom (''Buchbaum's director of research in Chicago'')refused to believe it. Others chuckled gleefully. Dr. Carrel was to blame only in that he did not keep on top of what was really going on in the laboratory (mostly, he wrote the papers). Dr. Parker and Dr. Ebeling probably suspected something, hence the &quot;retirement&quot;. In the interest of truth and science, the incident should have been thoroughly investigated. If it had been, some heads might have rolled, sacrificed to devotion to a wrong hypothesis - immortality of cell strains.&quot;. Witkowsky also reports a Dr. Margaret Murray telling him that &quot;one of Carrel's technicians of that time was passionately anti-fascist and detested Carrel's political and social ideas&quot; and expressing her belief that &quot;that this technician would willingly have discredited Carrel scientifically if possible.&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honors ===
In 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html The Nobel Stamps of 1972&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[lunar crater]] [[Carrel (crater)|Carrel]] was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.

In February 2002, as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's birth, the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/prize.htm Charles Lindbergh Symposium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; given to major contributors to &quot;development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth&quot;. [[Michael DeBakey]] and nine other scientists&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/laureates.htm Charles Lindbergh Symposium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; received the prize, a bronze statuette created for the event by the Italian artist C. Zoli and named &quot;Elisabeth&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondazionecarrel.org/sindex.html Foundation Alexis Carrel for thoracic and cardiovascular researches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; after Elisabeth Morrow, sister of Lindbergh's wife Anne Morrow, who died from heart disease.  It was in fact Lindbergh's disappointment that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her that led to Lindbergh's first contact with Carrel.

== ''Man, The Unknown'' (1935) ==
{{Main|Man, The Unknown}}
In 1935, Carrel published a book titled ''L'Homme, cet inconnu'' (''Man, The Unknown''), which became a best-seller. The book discussed &quot;the nature of society in light of discoveries in biology, physics, and medicine&quot;.&lt;ref name=simmons/&gt; It contained his own social prescriptions, advocating, in part, that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals, and by implementing a regime of enforced [[eugenics]]. Carrel claimed the existence of a &quot;hereditary biological aristocracy&quot; and argued that
&quot;deviant&quot; human types should be suppressed using techniques similar to those
later employed by the Nazis.

&quot;A euthanasia establishment, equipped with a suitable gas, would allow the humanitarian and economic disposal of those who have killed, committed armed robbery, kidnapped children, robbed the poor or seriously betrayed public confidence,&quot; Carrel wrote in ''L'Homme, cet Inconnu''. &quot;Would the same system not be appropriate for lunatics who have committed criminal acts?&quot; he suggested.

In the 1936 preface to the German edition of his book, Alexis Carrel added a praise to the eugenics policies of the Third Reich, writing that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Andrés Horacio Reggiani. ''Alexis Carrel, the Unknown: Eugenics and Population Research under Vichy'' (''[[French historical studies]]'', 25:2 Spring 2002) [http://fhs.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/25/2/331], p. 339. Also quoted in French by [[Didier Daeninckx]] in ''Quand le négationnisme s’invite à l’université.'', on [[Amnistia.net]] website, [http://www.amnistia.net/news/enquetes/negauniv/carrel/carrel.htm], URL consulted on January 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carrel also wrote in his book that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Thomas Szasz|Szasz, Thomas]]. ''The Theology of Medicine'' New York: Syracuse University Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems ==
In 1937, Carrel joined [[Jean Coutrot]]’s ''Centre d’Etudes des Problèmes Humains'' - Coutrot’s aim was to develop what he called an &quot;economic humanism&quot; through &quot;collective thinking.&quot; In 1941, through connections to the cabinet of [[Vichy France]] president [[Philippe Pétain]] (specifically, French industrial physicians [[André Gros]] and Jacques Ménétrier) he went on to advocate for the creation of the ''Fondation Française pour l’Etude des Problèmes Humains'' (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems) which was created by [[decree]] of the Vichy regime in 1941, and where he served as 'regent'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrés Horacio Reggiani p. 107&quot;/&gt; 

The Foundation was behind the origin of the December 16, 1942 Act inventing the &quot;prenuptial certificate&quot;, which had to precede any marriage and was supposed, after a biological examination, to insure the &quot;good health&quot; of the spouses, in particular in regard to sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and &quot;life hygiene&quot; (sic). Carrel's institute also conceived the &quot;scholar book&quot; (&quot;livret scolaire&quot;), which could be used to record students' grades in the French secondary schools, and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance.

The foundation was at the origin of the October 11, 1946 law, enacted by the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF), which institutionalized the field of [[occupational medicine]]. It worked on [[demographics]] (Robert Gessain, Paul Vincent, Jean Bourgeois-Pichat), on [[economics]], ([[François Perroux]]), on [[nutrition]] (Jean Sutter), on habitation (Jean Merlet) and on the first [[opinion poll]]s (Jean Stoetzel). &quot;The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health. It was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs—roughly one franc per inhabitant—a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation’s resources. By way of comparison, the whole [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) was given a budget of fifty million francs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fhs.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/25/2/331  (Reggiani)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Gwen Terrenoire, writing in ''Eugenics in France (1913-1941) : a review of research findings'', &quot;The foundation was a pluridisciplinary centre that employed around 300 researchers (mainly statisticians, psychologists, physicians) from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944. After the [[liberation of Paris]], Carrel was suspended by the Minister of Health; he died in November 1944, but the Foundation itself was &quot;purged&quot;, only to reappear in a short time as the [[Institut national d’études démographiques]] (INED) that is still active.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gwen Terrenoire, &quot;Eugenics in France (1913-1941): a review of research findings&quot;, Joint Programmatic Commission [[UNESCO]]-ONG Science and Ethics, 2003) [http://ong-comite-liaison.unesco.org/ongpho/acti/3/2/document/8/pdfen.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Carrel himself died on November 5, 1944, most members of his team did move to the INED, which was led by famous [[demographist]] [[Alfred Sauvy]], who coined the expression &quot;[[Third World]]&quot;. Others joined [[Robert Debré]]'s &quot;[[Institut national d'hygiène]]&quot; (National Hygiene Institute), which later became the [[INSERM]].

== Alexis Carrel and Lourdes ==

Alexis Carrel went from being a skeptic of the visions and miracles reported at [[Lourdes]] to being a believer after experiencing a healing he could not explain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaki&quot;&gt;Rev. [[Stanley Jaki]] [http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?id=2866 Two Lourdes Miracles and a Nobel Laureate: What Really Happened?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexis Carrel refused to discount a supernatural explanation and steadfastly reiterated his beliefs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaki&quot;/&gt; even writing a book describing his experience.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Carrel, ''The Voyage to Lourdes'' (New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a detriment to his career and reputation among his fellow doctors, and feeling he had no future in academic medicine in France, he emigrated to Canada with the intention of farming and raising cattle. After a brief period, he accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=simmons/&gt;

'''All Souls' Day''' commemorates the faithful [[afterlife|departed]]. In [[Western Christianity]], this day is observed principally in the [[Catholic Church]], although some churches of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]] and the [[Old Catholic Church]]es also celebrate it. The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]] observe several All Souls' Days during the year. The Roman Catholic celebration is associated with the doctrine that the souls of the faithful who at death have not been cleansed from the temporal punishment due to [[venial sin]]s and from attachment to [[mortal sin]]s cannot immediately attain the [[beatific vision]] in [[heaven (Christianity)|heaven]], and that they may be helped to do so by [[prayer]] and by the sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (see [[Purgatory]]).{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} In other words, when they died, they had not yet attained full sanctification and moral perfection, a requirement for entrance into Heaven. This sanctification is carried out posthumously in [[Purgatory]].

The official name of the celebration in the  [[Roman Rite]] [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is &quot;'''The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed'''&quot;.{{sfn|Mershman|1907}}
 
Another popular name in English is '''Feast of All Souls'''. In some other languages the celebration, not necessarily on the same date, is known as '''[[Day of the Dead]]''' (''Día de los Muertos'' or ''de los Difuntos'' in Spanish-speaking countries; [[Thursday of the Dead|''Yom el Maouta'']] in [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]] and [[Syria]]).

The Western celebration of All Souls' Day is on 2 November and follows [[All Saints' Day]], which commemorates the departed who have attained the beatific vision. If 2 November falls on a Sunday, the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Office]] is that of the Sunday. However, Morning and Evening Prayer ([[Lauds]] and [[Vespers]]) for the Dead, in which the people participate, may be said. In pre-1969 calendars, which some still follow, and in the Anglican Communion, All Souls Day is instead transferred, whenever 2 November falls on a Sunday, to the next day, 3 November, as in 2008.

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] dedicates several days throughout the year to the dead, mostly on Saturdays, because of Jesus' resting in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] on Saturday.

==The Western celebration==
[[File:All Souls procession, Tucson.jpg|thumb|All Souls' Day procession, [[Tucson, Arizona]], 2008]]
Historically, the Western tradition identifies the general custom of praying for the dead dating as far back as 2 Maccabees 12:42-46. The custom of setting apart a special day for intercession for certain of the faithful on November 2 was first established by [[St. Odilo of Cluny]] (d. 1048) at his [[abbey of Cluny]] in 998.&lt;ref&gt;The decree ordaining the celebration is printed in the [[Bollandist]] [[Acta Sanctorum]] (Saec. VI, pt. i. p. 585).&lt;/ref&gt; From Cluny the custom spread to the other houses of the Cluniac order, which became the largest and most extensive network of monasteries in Europe. The celebration was soon adopted in several [[diocese]]s in [[France]], and spread throughout the Western Church. It was accepted in Rome only in the fourteenth century. While 2 November remained the liturgical celebration, in time the entire month of November became associated in the Western Catholic tradition with prayer for the departed; lists of names of those to be remembered being placed in the proximity of the altar on which the sacrifice of the mass is offered.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}

The legend connected with its foundation is given by [[Peter Damiani]] in his ''Life of St Odilo'': a [[pilgrim]] returning from the [[Holy Land]] was cast by a [[storm]] on a desolate island. A [[hermit]] living there told him that amid the rocks was a chasm communicating with [[purgatory]], from which perpetually rose the groans of tortured souls. The hermit also claimed he had heard the [[demon]]s complaining of the efficacy of the prayers of the faithful, and especially the [[monk]]s of Cluny, in rescuing their victims. Upon returning home, the pilgrim hastened to inform the [[abbot of Cluny]], who then set 2 November as a day of intercession on the part of his community for all the souls in Purgatory.

==Eastern-Rite Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox churches==&lt;!-- [[Saturday of the dead]] redirects here --&gt;
Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] Christians, there are several All Souls' Days during the year. Most of these fall on Saturday, since [[Jesus]] lay in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on [[Holy Saturday]]. These are referred to as '''Soul Saturdays'''. They occur on the following occasions:
*The Saturday of [[Paschal cycle#Pre-Lent|Meatfare Week]] (the second Saturday before [[Great Lent]])—the day before the Sunday of the Last Judgement
*The second Saturday of Great Lent
*The third Saturday of Great Lent
*The fourth Saturday of Great Lent
*[[Radonitsa]] (Monday or Tuesday after [[Thomas Sunday]])
*The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]
*Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]]—26 October)

(In the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] there is also a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday closest to the Conception of [[St. John the Baptist]]—[[September 23 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|23 September]])

Saturdays throughout the year are devoted to general prayer for the departed, unless some greater [[Great Feasts|feast]] or [[saint]]'s commemoration occurs.

==Protestantism and Roman Catholic Church==
At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the celebration of All Souls' Day was fused with [[All Saints' Day]] in the [[Anglican Church]], though it was renewed individually in certain churches in connection with the [[Catholic Revival]] of the 19th century. The observance was restored with the publication of the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', and it features in ''[[Common Worship]]'' as a [[Lesser Festival]] called &quot;Commemoration of the Faithful Departed (All Souls' Day)&quot;.
[[File:Znicze01.JPG|thumb|300px|Polish grave lights]]
Among continental [[Protestantism|Protestants]] its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained. Even [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Luther's]] influence was not sufficient to abolish its celebration in [[Saxony]] during his lifetime; and, though its ecclesiastical sanction soon lapsed even in the [[Lutheran]] Church, its memory survives strongly in popular custom. Just as it is the custom of [[French people]], of all ranks and creeds, to decorate the graves of their dead on the ''jour des morts'', so [[German people|German]] {{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} and [[Polish people]] stream to the graveyards once a year with offerings of [[flower]]s and special grave lights (see the picture), and among [[Czech people]] the custom of visiting and tidying graves of relatives on the day is quite common even among [[atheism|atheists]]. In North America, however, most Protestant acknowledgment of the holiday is generally secular, celebrated in the form of [[Halloween]] festivities.

==Folklore==
The origins of  All Souls' Day in [[European folklore]] and [[folk belief]] are related to   customs of [[ancestor veneration]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} practised worldwide, such as the Chinese [[Ghost Festival]] or the Mexican [[Day of the Dead]]. The Roman custom was that of the [[Lemuria]].

In [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of [[milk]] on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.

In Bolivia, many people believe that the dead eat the food that is left out for them.
In Brazil people attend a mass or visit the cemetery taking flowers to decorate their relatives' grave, but no food is involved.

{{French literature (small)}}
'''Anatole France''' (16 April 1844 &amp;ndash; 12 October 1924), born '''François-Anatole Thibault''',&lt;ref name=wikifrance/&gt; was a French poet, journalist, and novelist. He was born in [[Paris]], and died in [[Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire]]. He was a successful novelist, with several best-sellers. Ironic and skeptical, he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters. He was a member of the ''[[Académie française]]'', and won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

== Early life ==
The son of a bookseller, France spent most of his life around books. His father's bookstore, called the ''Librairie France,'' specialized in books and papers on the [[French Revolution]] and was frequented by many notable writers and scholars of the day.&lt;ref name=wikifrance&gt;[[w:fr:Anatole France]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anatole France studied at the ''[[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]]'', a private Catholic school, and after graduation he helped his father by working in his bookstore. After several years he secured the position of cataloguer at Bacheline-Deflorenne and at Lemerre. In 1876 he was appointed librarian for the French Senate.

== Literary career ==
Anatole France began his career as a poet and a journalist. In 1869, ''Le Parnasse Contemporain'' published one of his poems, ''La Part de Madeleine''. In 1875, he sat on the committee which was in charge of the third ''Parnasse Contemporain'' compilation. He moved Paul Verlaine and Mallarmé aside of this ''Parnasse''. As a journalist, from 1867, he wrote a lot of articles and notices. He became famous with the novel ''Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard'' (1881). Its protagonist, skeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, embodied France's own personality. The novel was praised for its elegant prose and won him a prize from the French Academy. In ''La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque'' (1893) Anatole France ridiculed belief in the occult; and in ''Les Opinions de Jerome Coignard'' (1893), France captured the atmosphere of the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.

He was elected to the ''Académie française'' in 1896.

France took an important part in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. He signed [[Emile Zola]]'s manifesto supporting Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer who had been falsely convicted of [[espionage]]. France wrote about the affair in his 1901 novel ''Monsieur Bergeret''.

France's later works include ''[[Penguin Island (novel)|L'Île des Pingouins]]'' (1908) which satirizes human nature by depicting the transformation of penguins into humans - after the animals have been baptized in error by the nearsighted Abbot Mael. ''La Revolte des Anges'' (1914) is often considered France's most profound novel. It tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Arcade falls in love, joins the revolutionary movement of angels, and towards the end realizes that the overthrow of God is meaningless unless &quot;in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy [[Demiurge|Ialdabaoth]].&quot;

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. He died in 1924 and is buried in the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery]] near Paris.

In 1922,  France's entire works were put on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (Prohibited Books Index) of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/indexlibrorum.html |title= Modern History Sourcebook: Index librorum prohibitorum, 1557–1966 (Index of Prohibited Books) |first= Paul |last= Halsall |date= May l, 1998 |publisher= [[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]] ([[Fordham University]]) }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Index was abolished in 1966.

* &quot;The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich and the poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.&quot; (''Le Lys Rouge'')
* &quot;If the path be beautiful, let us not question where it leads.&quot;
* &quot;The history books which contain no lies are extremely tedious.&quot;
* &quot;I prefer the folly of enthusiasm to the indifference of wisdom.&quot;
* &quot;A person is never happy except at the price of some ignorance.&quot;
* &quot;To accomplish great things, we must not only act but also dream, not only plan but also believe.&quot;
* &quot;Irony is the gaiety of reflection and the joy of wisdom.&quot;
* &quot;Wandering re-establishes the original harmony which once existed between man and the universe.&quot;
* &quot;For every monarchy overthrown the sky becomes less brilliant, because it loses a star. A republic is ugliness set free.&quot;
* &quot;She fought him off vigorously, scratched, cried that she will die before she submits, but the chevalier paid no attention to her words and took her. Afterwards, she smiled coyly and told him: &quot;Do not think, dear chevalier, that you won me against my will. Better thank our good preacher who reminded me that we are mortal, and a pleasure missed today is missed forever. Now we can proceed, for I missed too many pleasures while being too prudent for my own good.&quot; (Fable by Anatole France.)
* &quot;Nine tenths of education is encouragement.&quot;
* &quot;All religions breed crime.&quot; (''Thaïs'')
* &quot;The people who have no weaknesses are terrible: there is no way of taking advantage of them.&quot; (''The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard'')
* &quot;It is human nature to think wisely and act in an absurd fashion.&quot;
* &quot;The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.&quot;
* &quot;Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened.&quot;
* &quot;Stupidity is far more dangerous than evil, for evil takes a break from time to time, stupidity does not.&quot;
* &quot;All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another.&quot;
* &quot;We have never heard the devil's side of the story, God wrote all the book.&quot;
* &quot;One must learn to think well before learning to think; afterward it proves too difficult.&quot;
* &quot;An education isn't how much you have committed to memory, or even how much you know. It's being able to differentiate between what you do know and what you don't.&quot;

{{French literature (small)}}
'''André Paul Guillaume Gide''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe pɔl ɡijom ʒid}}) (22 November 1869 – 19 February 1951) was a [[France|French]] [[author]] and winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in literature in 1947. Gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] movement, to the advent of [[Anti-imperialism|anticolonialism]] between the two [[World Wars]].

Known for his [[fiction]] as well as his [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation between the two sides of his personality, split apart by a strait-laced education and a narrow social moralism. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and gravitates around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his 1936 voyage to the [[USSR]].

==Early life==
Gide was born in [[Paris]] on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class Protestant family. His father was a [[University of Paris|Paris University]] professor of law and died in 1880. His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]].

Gide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andre Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'André Walter''), in 1891.

In 1893 and 1894, Gide traveled in [[Northern Africa]], and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.&lt;ref&gt;If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir by Andre Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books 1935 translated by Dorothy Bussy: &quot;but when Ali - that was my little guide's name - led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country&quot;. . .&quot;As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back&quot;. . .&quot;I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation&quot;. . .&quot;I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground.&quot;[p.251]&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in [[Algiers]]. There, Wilde had the impression that he had introduced Gide to homosexuality, but, in fact, Gide had already discovered this on his own.&lt;ref&gt;Out of the past, Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the present (Miller 1995:87)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir by Andre Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books 1935 translated by Dorothy Bussy: &quot;I should say that if Wilde had begun to discover the secrets of his life to me, he knew nothing as yet of mine; I had taken care to give him no hint of them, either by deed or word.&quot; . . .&quot;No doubt, since my adventure at Sousse, there was not much left for the Adversary to do to complete his victory over me; but Wilde did not know this, nor that I was vanquished beforehand or, if you will&quot;. . .&quot;that I had already triumphed in my imagination and my thoughts over all my scruples.&quot;[p.286])&lt;/ref&gt;

==The middle years==
In 1895, after his mother's death, he married his [[cousin]] Madeleine Rondeaux, but the marriage remained unconsummated. In 1896, he became mayor of [[La Roque-Baignard]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] in Normandy.

In 1901, Gide rented the property [[Maderia]] in [[Saint Brelade|St. Brelade's Bay]] and lived there while residing in [[Jersey]]. This period, 1901–1907, is commonly seen as a period of apathy and unsettlement in his life.

In 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'' (''The New French Review'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html Nobel Prize Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, [[Marc Allégret]], only 15 years old, became his lover. Marc was the son of Elie Allégret, best man at Gide's wedding. Of Allégret's five children, André Gide adopted Marc. The two fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence, &quot;the best part of myself,&quot; as he was later to comment. In 1918, he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and who would translate many of his works into English.

In the [[1920s]], Gide became an inspiration for writers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.

In 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe,  a woman who was much younger than him. He had known Elisabeth for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend, the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Théo van Rysselberghe]]. This would cause the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between Allégret and Gide and damaged the relation with Van Rysselberghe. This was possibly his only sexual liaison with a woman and it was brief in the extreme, but his daughter Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth &quot;La Dame Blanche&quot; (&quot;The White Lady&quot;). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each of them on the rue Vavin). She worshipped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938. Later he used the background of his unconsummated marriage in his novel ''Et Nunc Manet in Te.''

In 1924, he published an autobiography, ''Unless the seed dies'' (French: ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'').

After 1925, he began to demand more humane conditions for criminals.

==Africa==
From July 1926 to May 1927, he travelled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] [[colony]] with his lover [[Marc Allégret]]. He went successively to [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), [[Oubangui-Chari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly to [[Chad]] and then to [[Cameroun]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''Return from Chad'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform. In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''régime des Grandes Concessions''), i.e. a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular [[rubber]]. He related for instance how natives were forced to leave their village during several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their exploitation to [[slavery]]. The book had important influence on [[anti-colonialism]] movements in France and helped re-evaluate the [[Impact and evaluation of colonialism and colonization|impact of colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC=31184/idR=219/idTC=3/idG=2 Voyage au Congo suivi du Retour du Tchad], in ''[[Lire]]'', July–August 1995 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
During the 1930s, he briefly became a [[communism|communist]], or more precisely, a [[fellow traveler]] (he never formally joined the Communist Party).  As a distinguished writer sympathizing with the cause of communism, he was invited to tour the [[Soviet Union]] as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers.  The tour disillusioned him and he subsequently became quite critical of Soviet Communism. This criticism of Communism caused him to lose [[socialism|socialist]] friends, especially when he made a clean break with it in ''Retour de L'U.R.S.S.'' in 1936. He was also a contributor to ''[[The God That Failed]]''.

==The 1940s==
Gide left France for Africa in 1942 and lived in [[Tunis]] until the end of [[World War II]]. In 1947, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He devoted much of his last years to publishing his Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{seealso|Computational formula for the variance}}

'''Algorithms for calculating variance''' play a major role in [[statistics|statistical]] computing. A key problem in the design of good [[algorithm]]s for this problem is that formulas for the [[variance]] may involve sums of squares, which can lead to [[numerical instability]] as well as to [[arithmetic overflow]] when dealing with large values.

==Naïve algorithm==
The [[formula]] for calculating the variance of an entire [[statistical population|population]] of size ''n'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2/n}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The formula for calculating an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] estimate of the population variance from a finite [[statistical sample|sample]] of ''n'' observations is:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2/n}{n-1}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore a naive algorithm to calculate the estimated variance is given by the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def naive_variance(data):
    n = 0
    Sum = 0
    Sum_sqr = 0
    
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        Sum = Sum + x
        Sum_sqr = Sum_sqr + x*x
     
    mean = Sum/n
    variance = (Sum_sqr - Sum*mean)/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population: simply divide by ''n'' instead of ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 on the last line.

Because &lt;code&gt;sum_sqr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sum * mean&lt;/code&gt; can be very similar numbers, the [[precision (arithmetic)|precision]] of the result can be much less than the inherent precision of the [[floating-point]] arithmetic used to perform the computation.  This is particularly bad if the standard deviation is small relative to the mean.

==Two-pass algorithm==
An alternate approach, using a different formula for the variance, first computes the sample mean,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x = \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n x_j/n&lt;/math&gt;,
and then computes the sum of the squares of the differences from the mean,
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2}{n-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;,
as given by the following pseudocode:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def two_pass_variance(data):
    n    = 0
    sum1 = 0
    sum2 = 0
    
    for x in data:
        n    = n + 1
        sum1 = sum1 + x
    
    mean = sum1/n

    for x in data:
        sum2 = sum2 + (x - mean)*(x - mean)
    
    variance = sum2/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm is often more numerically reliable than the naïve [[#Naïve algorithm|algorithm]] for large sets of data, although it can be worse if much of the data is very close to but not precisely equal to the mean and some are quite far away from it.

The results of both of these simple algorithms (I and II) can depend inordinately on the ordering of the data and can give poor results for very large data sets due to repeated roundoff error in the accumulation of the sums. Techniques such as [[compensated summation]] can be used to combat this error to a degree.

===Compensated variant===
The compensated-summation version of the algorithm above reads{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}:&lt;!--Where did this algorithm come from?  It is not the normal form for a Kahan summation.--&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def compensated_variance(data):
    n = 0
    sum1 = 0
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        sum1 = sum1 + x
    mean = sum1/n
     
    sum2 = 0
    sum3 = 0
    for x in data:
        sum2 = sum2 + (x - mean)**2
        sum3 = sum3 + (x - mean)
    variance = (sum2 - sum3**2/n)/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

==On-line algorithm==
It is often useful to be able to compute the variance in a single pass, inspecting each value &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; only once; for example, when the data are being collected without enough storage to keep all the values, or when costs of memory access dominate those of computation.  For such an [[online algorithm]], a [[recurrence relation]] is required between quantities from which the required statistics can be calculated in a numerically stable fashion.

The following formulas can be used to update the [[mean]] and (estimated) variance of the sequence, for an additional element &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{new}}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the sample mean of the first ''n'' samples (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; their sample variance, and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; their population variance.

:&lt;math&gt;\bar x_n = \frac{(n-1) \, \bar x_{n-1} + x_n}{n} = \bar x_{n-1} + \frac{x_n - \bar x_{n-1}}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s^2_n = \frac{(n-2) \, s^2_{n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n) (x_n - \bar x_{n-1})}{n-1}, \quad n&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_n = \frac{(n-1) \, \sigma^2_{n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n) \, (x_n - \bar x_{n-1})}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that a more suitable quantity for updating is the sum of squares of differences from the (current) mean, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x_n)^2&lt;/math&gt;, here denoted &lt;math&gt;M_{2,n}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{2,n}\! = M_{2,n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n)(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2_n = \frac{M_{2,n}}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_n = \frac{M_{2,n}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

A numerically stable algorithm is given below.  It also computes the mean.
This algorithm is due to Knuth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald E. Knuth]] (1998). ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', volume 2: ''Seminumerical Algorithms'', 3rd edn., p. 232. Boston: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;
who cites Welford.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Welford (1962).[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1266577 &quot;Note on a method for calculating corrected sums of squares and products&quot;]. ''[[Technometrics]]'' 4(3):419–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def online_variance(data):
    n = 0
    mean = 0
    M2 = 0
     
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        delta = x - mean
        mean = mean + delta/n
        M2 = M2 + delta*(x - mean)  # This expression uses the new value of mean
 
    variance_n = M2/n
    variance = M2/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to massive cancellation, but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop.  For a particularly robust two-pass algorithm for computing the variance, first compute and subtract an estimate of the mean, and then use this algorithm on the residuals.

The [[Algorithms for calculating variance#Parallel_algorithm|parallel algorithm]] below illustrates how to merge multiple sets of statistics calculated on-line.

==Weighted incremental algorithm==
When the observations are weighted, West (1979)&lt;ref&gt;D. H. D. West (1979). ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', 22, 9, 532-535: ''Updating Mean and Variance Estimates: An Improved Method''&lt;/ref&gt; suggests this incremental algorithm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def weighted_incremental_variance(dataWeightPairs):
    mean = 0
    S = 0
    sumweight = 0
    for x, weight in dataWeightPairs: # Alternately &quot;for x in zip(data, weight):&quot;
        temp = weight + sumweight
        Q = x - mean
        R = Q * weight / temp
        S = S + sumweight * Q * R
        mean = mean + R
        sumweight = temp
    Variance = S / (sumweight-1)  # if sample is the population, omit -1
    return Variance
&lt;/source&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta\! = \bar x_B - \bar x_A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x_X = \bar x_A + \delta\cdot\frac{n_B}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2,X} = M_{2,A} + M_{2,B} + \delta^2\cdot\frac{n_A n_B}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;.
This may be useful when, for example, multiple processing units may be assigned to discrete parts of the input.

Chan's method for estimating the mean is numerically unstable when &lt;math&gt;n_A \approx n_B&lt;/math&gt; and both are large, because the numerical error in &lt;math&gt;\bar x_B - \bar x_A&lt;/math&gt; is not scaled down in the way that it is in the &lt;math&gt;n_B = 1&lt;/math&gt; case. In such cases, prefer &lt;math&gt;\bar x_X = \frac{n_A \bar x_A + n_B \bar x_B}{n_A + n_B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
Assume that all floating point operations use the standard [[IEEE 754#Double-precision 64 bit|IEEE 754 double-precision]] arithmetic. Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30.  Both Algorithm I and Algorithm II compute these values correctly.  Next consider the sample (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;13, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;16), which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample.  Algorithm II computes this variance estimate correctly, but Algorithm I returns 29.333333333333332 instead of 30.  While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of Algorithm I, it is easy to find data that reveal a major flaw in the naive algorithm: Take the sample to be (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;13, 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;16).  Again the estimated population variance of 30 is computed correctly by Algorithm II, but the naive algorithm now computes it as −170.66666666666666.  This is a serious problem with Algorithm I and is due to [[catastrophic cancellation]] in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm.

==Higher-order statistics==

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extends Chan's formulae to calculating the third and fourth [[central moment]]s, needed for example when estimating [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]]:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{3,X} = M_{3,A} + M_{3,B} + \delta^3\frac{n_A n_B (n_A - n_B)}{n_X^2} + 3\delta\frac{n_AM_{2,B} - n_BM_{2,A}}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M_{4,X} = M_{4,A} + M_{4,B} &amp; + \delta^4\frac{n_A n_B \left(n_A^2 - n_A n_B + n_B^2\right)}{n_X^3} \\
                    &amp; + 6\delta^2\frac{n_A^2 M_{2,B} + n_B^2 M_{2,A}}{n_X^2} + 4\delta\frac{n_AM_{3,B} - n_BM_{3,A}}{n_X} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;M_k&lt;/math&gt; are again the sums of powers of differences from the mean &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(x - \overline{x})^k&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:skewness: &lt;math&gt;g_1 = \frac{\sqrt{n} M_3}{M_2^{3/2}},&lt;/math&gt;
:kurtosis: &lt;math&gt;g_2 = \frac{n M_4}{M_2^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the incremental case (i.e., &lt;math&gt;B = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;), this simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta\! = x - m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m' = m + \frac{\delta}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2' = M_2 + \delta^2 \frac{ n-1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_3' = M_3 + \delta^3 \frac{ (n - 1) (n - 2)}{n^2} - \frac{3\delta M_2}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_4' = M_4 + \frac{\delta^4 (n - 1) (n^2 - 3n + 3)}{n^3} + \frac{6\delta^2 M_2}{n^2} - \frac{4\delta M_3}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

By preserving the value &lt;math&gt;\delta / n&lt;/math&gt;, only one division operation is needed and the higher-order statistics can thus be calculated for little incremental cost.

An example of the online algorithm for kurtosis implemented as described is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def online_kurtosis(data):
    n = 0
    mean = 0
    M2 = 0
    M3 = 0
    M4 = 0

    for x in data:
        n1 = n
        n = n + 1
        delta = x - mean
        delta_n = delta / n
        delta_n2 = delta_n * delta_n
        term1 = delta * delta_n * n1
        mean = mean + delta_n
        M4 = M4 + term1 * delta_n2 * (n*n - 3*n + 3) + 6 * delta_n2 * M2 - 4 * delta_n * M3
        M3 = M3 + term1 * delta_n * (n - 2) - 3 * delta_n * M2
        M2 = M2 + term1

    kurtosis = (n*M4) / (M2*M2) - 3
    return kurtosis
&lt;/source&gt;

offer two alternate methods to compute the skewness and kurtosis, each of which can save substantial computer memory requirements and CPU time in certain applications. The first approach is to compute the statistical moments by separating the data into bins and then computing the moments from the geometry of the resulting histogram, which effectively becomes a one-pass algorithm for higher moments. One benefit is that the statistical moment calculations can be carried out to arbitrary accuracy such that the computations can be tuned to the precision of, e.g., the data storage format or the original measurement hardware.  A relative histogram of a random variable can be constructed in
the conventional way: the range of potential values is
divided into bins and the number of occurrences within each bin are
counted and plotted such that the area of each rectangle equals
the portion of the sample values within that bin:

: &lt;math&gt; H(x_k)=\frac{h(x_k)}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; represent the frequency and
the relative frequency at bin &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A= \sum_{k=1}^{K} h(x_k)
\,\Delta x_k&lt;/math&gt; is the total area of the histogram. After this
normalization, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; raw moments and central moments of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
can be calculated from the relative histogram:

: &lt;math&gt;
 m_n^{(h)} = \sum_{k=1}^{K}  x_k^n \, H(x_k) \Delta x_k
            = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{k=1}^{K}  x_k^n \, h(x_k) \Delta x_k
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 \theta_n^{(h)}= \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\Big)^n \, H(x_k)\Delta x_k
               = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\Big)^n \, h(x_k) \Delta x_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where the superscript &lt;math&gt;^{(h)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates the moments are
calculated from the histogram. For constant bin width &lt;math&gt;\Delta
x_k=\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; these two expressions can be simplified using &lt;math&gt;I= A/\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 m_n^{(h)}= \frac{1}{I} {\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_k^n \, h(x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 \theta_n^{(h)}= \frac{1}{I}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\Big)^n \, h(x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second approach from Choi and Sweetman
&lt;ref name=&quot;Choi2010&quot; /&gt;
is an analytical methodology to combine statistical moments from individual segments of a time-history such that the resulting overall moments are those of the complete time-history. This methodology could be used for parallel computation of statistical moments with subsequent combination of those moments, or for combination of statistical moments computed at sequential times.

If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; sets of statistical moments are known:
&lt;math&gt;(\gamma_{0,q},\mu_{q},\sigma^2_{q},\alpha_{3,q},\alpha_{4,q})
\quad &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;q=1,2,...,Q &lt;/math&gt;, then each &lt;math&gt;\gamma_n&lt;/math&gt; can
be expressed in terms of the equivalent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; raw moments:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \gamma_{n,q}= m_{n,q} \gamma_{0,q} \qquad \quad \textrm{for} \quad n=1,2,3,4  \quad \text{ and } \quad q = 1,2, \dots ,Q
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{0,q}&lt;/math&gt; is generally taken to be the duration of the &lt;math&gt;q^{th}&lt;/math&gt; time-history, or the number of points if &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

The benefit of expressing the statistical moments in
terms of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is that the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; sets can be combined by
addition, and there is no upper limit on the value of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;
 \gamma_{n,c}= \sum_{q=1}^{Q}\gamma_{n,q} \quad \quad \textrm{for} \quad n=0,1,2,3,4
&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;_c&lt;/math&gt; represents the concatenated
time-history or combined &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. These combined values of
&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can then be inversely transformed into raw moments
representing the complete concatenated time-history

: &lt;math&gt;
 m_{n,c}=\frac{\gamma_{n,c}}{\gamma_{0,c}} \quad \textrm{for} \quad n=1,2,3,4
&lt;/math&gt;

Known relationships between the raw moments (&lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt;) and the central moments  (&lt;math&gt; \theta_n = E[(x-\mu)^n])&lt;/math&gt;)
are then used to compute the central moments of the concatenated time-history.  Finally, the statistical moments of the concatenated history are computed from the central moments:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \mu_c=m_{1,c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \sigma^2_c=\theta_{2,c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \alpha_{3,c}=\frac{\theta_{3,c}}{\sigma_c^3}
 \ \ \ \ \ \alpha_{4,c}=\frac{\theta_{4,c}}{\sigma_c^4}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Covariance==
Very similar algorithms can be used to compute the covariance.  The naive algorithm is:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i)/n}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

For the algorithm above, one could use the following algorithm:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def naive_covariance(data1, data2):
	n = len(data1)
	sum12 = 0
	sum1 = sum(data1)
	sum2 = sum(data2)

	for i in range(n):
		sum12 += data1[i]*data2[i]

	covariance = (sum12 - sum1*sum2 / n) / n
	return covariance
&lt;/source&gt;

A more numerically stable two-pass algorithm first computes the sample means, and then the covariance:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar y = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n y_i/n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The two-pass algorithm may be written as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def two_pass_covariance(data1, data2):
	n = len(data1)

	mean1 = sum(data1) / n
	mean2 = sum(data2) / n	

	covariance = 0

	for i in range(n):
		a = data1[i] - mean1		
		b = data2[i] - mean2
		covariance += a*b / n

	return covariance
&lt;/source&gt;

A slightly more accurate compensated version performs the full naive algorithm on the residuals.  The final sums &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum y_i&lt;/math&gt; ''should'' be zero, but the second pass compensates for any small error.

A stable one-pass algorithm exists, similar to the one above, that computes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle C_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x_n)(y_i - \bar y_n)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x_n = \bar x_{n-1} + \frac{x_n - \bar x_{n-1}}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar y_n = \bar y_{n-1} + \frac{y_n - \bar y_{n-1}}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_n = C_{n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n)(y_n - \bar y_{n-1}) = C_{n-1} + (y_n - \bar y_n)(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
The apparent asymmetry in that last equation is due to the fact that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (x_n - \bar x_n) = \frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;, so both update terms are equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})(y_n - \bar y_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;.  Even greater accuracy can be achieved by first computing the means, then using the stable one-pass algorithm on the residuals.

Likewise, there is a formula for combining the covariances of two sets that can be used to parallelize the computation:
:&lt;math&gt;C_X = C_A + C_B + (\bar x_A - \bar x_B)(\bar y_A - \bar y_B)\cdot\frac{n_A n_B}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''almond''' ('''''Prunus dulcis''''', [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Botany|syn.]] ''Prunus amygdalus'' Batsch., ''Amygdalus communis'' L., ''Amygdalus dulcis'' Mill.), is a species of tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. Almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', it is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated shell ([[endocarp]]) surrounding the seed.

The fruit of the almond is not a [[nut (fruit)|true nut]], but a [[drupe]], consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed (&quot;nut&quot;) inside.  Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the [[seed]]. Almonds are commonly sold '''shelled''' (i.e., after the shells are removed), or '''unshelled''' (i.e., with the shells still attached). '''[[Blanching (cooking)|Blanched]]''' almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the [[seedcoat]], which is then removed to reveal the white [[embryo]].

== Description ==
===Tree===
The almond is a small [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing to between 4 and 10 meters in height, with a trunk of up to 30 centimetres in diameter. The young [[twig]]s are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 3–5&amp;nbsp;inches long,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H.; Bailey, E.Z.; the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium. 1976. ''Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada''. Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; with a serrated margin and a {{convert|2.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The [[flower]]s are white or pale pink, 3–5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs before the leaves in early spring.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;{{cite book |last=Rushforth |first=Keith |title=Collins wildlife trust guide trees: a photographic guide to the trees of Britain and Europe |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |year=1999 |isbn=0-00-220013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Mark D. |coauthors=Anthony Julian Huxley |title=The New Royal Horticultural Society dictionary of gardening |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-333-47494-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almond trees become productive and begin bearing fruit after five years.  The fruit is mature in the autumn, 7–8 months after flowering.&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;

===Nut===
In botanical terms, the almond fruit is not a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], but a [[drupe]] 3.5–6&amp;nbsp;cm long. The outer covering or [[exocarp]], fleshy in other members of ''Prunus'' such as the [[plum]] and [[cherry]], is instead a thick leathery grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated hard woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the [[endocarp]]. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally there are two.

== Origin and history ==
The almond is a native to the [[Mediterranean climate]] region of the [[Middle East]], eastward as far as the [[Indus]].&lt;ref name=Rieger&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vUXKIkjDtAQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA38 Introduction to Fruit Crops], p. 38, Mark Rieger, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably [[California]], United States.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;
[[Image:Almondtrees.jpg|thumb|left|A grove of almond trees in southern California]]

The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the [[Levant]]; almonds must first have been taken into cultivation in this region. The fruit of the wild forms contains the [[glycoside]] [[amygdalin]], &quot;which becomes transformed into deadly prussic acid ([[hydrogen cyanide]]) after crushing, chewing, or any other injury to the seed.&quot;&lt;ref name=zohary&gt;{{cite book |last=Zohary |first=Daniel |coauthors=Maria Hopf |title=Domestication of plants in the old world: the origin and spread of cultivated plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=186 |isbn=0-19-850356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, domesticated almonds are not toxic; [[Jared Diamond]] argues that a common genetic mutation causes an absence of glycoside amygdalin, and this mutant was grown by early farmers, &quot;at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies]] |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=118 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zohary and Hopf believe that almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees due to &quot;the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of [[grafting]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=zohary/&gt; Domesticated almonds appear in the [[Early Bronze Age]] (3000–2000 BC) of the Near East, or possibly a little earlier. A well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant.&lt;ref name=zohary/&gt;  Of the [[Europe]]an countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://193.62.154.38/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Prunus&amp;SPECIES_XREF=dulcis&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= |title=''Flora Europaea'' Search Results |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Prunus+dulcis |title=''Prunus dulcis'' |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Plants for a Future]]}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and names ===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
The word &quot;almond&quot; comes from Old French ''almande'' or ''alemande'', [[Late Latin]] ''amandola'', derived through a form ''amingdolouhha'' from the Greek ''αμυγδαλη'' (cf [[amygdala]]), an almond. The ''al-'' in English, for the ''a-'' used in other languages may be due  a confusion with the [[Arabic]] article ''al'', the word having first dropped the ''a-'' as in the [[Italian language|Italian]] form ''mandorla''; the British pronunciation ''ah-mond'' and the modern Catalan ''ametlla'' and modern French ''amande'' show a form of the word closer to the original.

The adjective ''amygdaloid'' (literally &quot;like an almond&quot;) is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a [[rectangle]] and an [[ellipse]]. See, for example, the [[neuroanatomy|brain structure]] ''[[amygdala]]'', which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term.

== Production ==
[[File:AlmondShakerbeforeafter.jpg|thumb|right|An almond shaker before and during a harvest of a tree]]
Global production of almonds is around 1.7 million tonnes, with a low of 1 million tonnes in 1995 and a peak of 1.85 million tonnes in 2002 according to [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) figures; world production of almonds was 1.76 million tonnes in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/Hort_Circular/2004/12-10-04/12-04%20Almonds.pdf United States Department of Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FAO, major producers are the USA (715,623 t, 41%), Spain (220,000 t, 13%), Syria (119,648 t, 7%), Italy (112,796 t, 6%), Iran (108,677 t, 6%) and Morocco (83,000 t, 5%). Algeria, Tunisia, and Greece each account for 3%, Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and China each account for 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Turkey]], most of the production comes from the [[Datça Peninsula]]. In Spain, numerous commercial cultivars of sweet almond are produced, most notably the Jordan almond (imported from [[Málaga]]) and the [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] almond.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In Greece, most of the production comes from the [[Thessalia]], in region of [[Magnesia]] at the area of [[Almyros]]. The most cultivating types of almonds in Greece are ferragnes and texas (mission). 

In the United States, production is concentrated in [[California]], with almonds being California's third leading agricultural product and its top agricultural export in 2008. California produces 80% of the world’s almonds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/Tree%20Nuts/2009_Almonds.pdf USDA Foreign Agricultural Service 2009/2010 Almond Forecast Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of the U.S. commercial supply. California exported almonds valued at $1.08 billion in 2003, about 70% of total California almond crop.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

=== Pollination ===
The [[pollination]] of California's almonds is the largest annual [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, with close to one million hives (nearly half of all [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] in the USA) being trucked in February to the almond groves. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory [[beekeeper]]s from at least 49 states for the event.  This business has been heavily impacted by [[colony collapse disorder]], causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of [[insect pollination]].  To alleviate almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) have developed a new line of [[self-pollinating]] almond trees.&lt;ref name=ARS&gt;Alfredo Flores. &quot;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100406.htm ARS Scientists Develop Self-pollinating Almond Trees]&quot;. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service]], April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the [[Tuono]] almond tree, have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California Nonpareil almond tree.  The Nonpareil tree produces large, smooth almonds and offer 60–65% edible kernel per nut.  The Tuono, on the other hand, has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut.  However, there are advantages to having a thick shell.  The Tuono’s shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the [[navel orangeworm]].  ARS researchers have managed to cross breed the pest-resistant Tuono tree with California’s attractive Nonpareil tree, resulting in [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ized varieties of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high quality of nut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The bitter almond is slightly broader and shorter than the sweet almond, and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme [[emulsin]] which, in the presence of water, acts on a [[soluble]] [[glucoside]], [[amygdalin]], yielding [[glucose]], [[cyanide]] and the [[essential oil]] of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure [[benzaldehyde]]. Bitter almonds may yield from 4–9&amp;nbsp;mg of [[hydrogen cyanide]] per almond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karkocha I |title=[Semiquantitative method of hydrogen cyanide and sweet almonds] |language=Polish |journal=Roczniki Państwowego Zakładu Higieny |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=703–5 |year=1973 |month=January |pmid=4775628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shragg TA, Albertson TE, Fisher CJ |title=Cyanide poisoning after bitter almond ingestion |journal=West.

== Culinary uses ==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
[[File:Smoked almonds.JPG|thumb|left|Smoked and salted almonds]]
While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as almond butter, almond milk and almond oil. These variations can be used in both sweet and savory dishes.

Along with other nuts, sweet almonds can be sprinkled over desserts, particularly ice cream based dishes. Sweet almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including [[jesuite]]s), cookies (including [[macaron|French macarons]], [[macaroon]]s), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), [[noghl]] and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its less salty taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (&quot;green almonds&quot;) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Available only from mid April to mid June (northern hemisphere), pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.

*In [[China]], almonds are used in a popular dessert where they are mixed with milk and then served hot.

*In [[Greece]], ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (αμυγδαλωτά).  Because of their white colour, most are traditionally considered &quot;wedding sweets&quot; and are served at wedding banquets (also in [[Turkey]]). In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.

*In [[Iran]], green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called '''Chaqalu bâdom'''.

*In [[Italy]], the bitter almonds from apricots are the base for [[Amaretti di Saronno|amaretti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amaretto Macaroon|title=Fine Italian Pastries &amp; Biscotti|url=http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vicenzi Amaretto s'Italia (Macaroona)|url=http://www.amazon.com/Vicenzi-Amaretto-sItalia-Macaroona-Packages/dp/B000H7K5PQ|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10-20%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in [[torrone]]. In [[Puglia]] and [[Sicily]], &quot;pasta di mandorle&quot; (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistacchio]] or chocolate.

*In [[Morocco]], almonds in the form of [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in several [[List_of_Moroccan_dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Whole fried almonds are also used in sweet [[tajine]]s.  A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes.

*In  [[Indian cuisine|India]], almonds are the base ingredients of [[pasanda]]-style [[curry|curries]]. [[Badam halva]] is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as [[sohan barfi]]), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface.

*In [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistan]] , almonds are the base ingredients of many food items. Meat dishes containing almonds include [[pasanda]]-style or Mughalai[[curry|curries]]. [[Badam halva]] is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as [[sohan barfi]]), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or 'Sherbet-e-Badaam' in [[Urdu]], is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.

Almonds can be processed into a [[milk substitute]] called [[almond milk]]; the nut's soft texture, mild flavour, and light colouring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice, for [[lactose intolerant]] people and [[vegans]]. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds all work well for different production techniques, some of which are very similar to that of [[soymilk]] and some of which actually use no heat, resulting in &quot;raw milk&quot; (see [[raw foodism]]).

The [[Marcona (almond)|Marcona]] variety of almond, which is shorter, rounder, sweeter, and more delicate in texture than other varieties, originated in Spain and is becoming popular in North America and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tienda.com/press/mercurynews.html Marcona almonds]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcona almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are also used by Spanish chefs to prepare a dessert called ''[[turrón]]''.

=== Almond syrup ===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
Historically, almond syrup was an [[emulsion]] of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with [[barley syrup]] ([[orgeat syrup]]) or in a syrup of [[orange flower water]] and [[sugar]].

''[[The Grocer's Encyclopedia]]'' (1911) notes that &quot;Ten parts of sweet almonds are generally employed to three parts of bitter almonds&quot;; however, due to the [[cyanide]] found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally consist of only sweet almonds.

== Oils ==
{{Ref improve section|date=November 2010}}
Almonds contain approximately 49% [[Fat|oils]], of which 62% is monounsaturated [[oleic acid]] (an [[omega-9 fatty acid]]), 24% is [[linoleic acid]] (a polyunsaturated [[omega-6]] [[essential fatty acid]]), and 6% is [[palmitic acid]] (a [[saturated fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ Search the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference] under &quot;Nuts, almonds&quot;. [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Oleum Amygdalae&quot;, the fixed oil, is prepared from either variety of almond and is a glyceryl oleate, with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]] but readily soluble in [[chloroform]] or [[diethyl ether|ether]]. Sweet almond oil is obtained from the dried [[seed|kernel]] of sweet almonds.

The oil is good for application to the skin as an [[emollient]], and has been traditionally used by [[massage therapist]]s to lubricate the skin during a massage session.  It is a mild, lightweight oil that can be used as a substitute for [[olive oil]].

Almond oil is also used as a wood conditioner of certain woodwind instruments, such as the oboe and clarinet.

The sweet almond contains about 26% [[carbohydrates]] (12% dietary fiber, 6.3% sugars, 0.7% starch and the rest miscellaneous carbohydrates), and may therefore be made into flour for cakes and cookies (biscuits) for low-carbohydrate diets. A standard serving of almond flour, 1&amp;nbsp;cup, contains 20&amp;nbsp;grams of carbohydrates, of which 10&amp;nbsp;g is [[dietary fiber]], for a net of 10&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrate per cup.  This makes almond flour very desirable for use in cake and bread recipes by people on carbohydrate-restricted diets.

Almonds are a rich source of [[vitamin E]], containing 24&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref&gt;White, G. [http://www.allaboutvision.com/nutrition/vitamin_e.htm Vitamin E and Minerals: Nutrition from Nuts.] AllAboutVision.com. Retrieved August 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also rich in [[dietary fiber]], [[B vitamin]]s, [[essential mineral]]s and [[monounsaturated fat]] (see nutrient table), one of the two &quot;good&quot; fats which potentially may lower [[LDL cholesterol]]. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds also contain [[phytosterol]]s, associated with cholesterol-lowering properties.

Potential health benefits, which have not been scientifically validated, include improved [[complexion]] and possibly a lower risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis PA, Iwahashi CK |title=Whole almonds and almond fractions reduce aberrant crypt foci in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis |journal=Cancer Lett. |volume=165 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11248415 |doi= 10.1016/S0304-3835(01)00425-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304383501004256 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research associates consumption of almonds with elevating blood levels of [[high density lipoprotein]]s and lowering [[low density lipoprotein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Almonds: Cholesterol lowering, heart-healthy snack |publisher=[[Porter Novelli]] |year=2002 |month=September |url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/D/20024677.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spiller GA, Jenkins DA, Bosello O, Gates JE, Cragen LN, Bruce B |title=Nuts and plasma lipids: an almond-based diet lowers LDL-C while preserving HDL-C |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=285–90 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9627917 |doi= |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9627917 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary trial showed that, in spite of the high fat content of almonds, using them in the daily diet might lower several factors associated with heart disease, including cholesterol and blood lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jenkins DJ, Kendall CW, Marchie A, ''et al.'' |title=Dose response of almonds on coronary heart disease risk factors: blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and pulmonary nitric oxide: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial |journal=Circulation |volume=106 |issue=11 |pages=1327–32 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12221048 |doi= 10.1161/01.CIR.0000028421.91733.20|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/11/1327 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almonds may cause [[food allergy|allergy]] or [[food intolerance|intolerance]]. Cross-reactivity is common with [[peach]] [[allergens]] ([[lipid transfer proteins]]) and tree [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] allergens. Symptoms range from local symptoms (e.g., [[oral allergy syndrome]], [[contact urticaria]]) to systemic symptoms including [[anaphylaxis]] (e.g., [[urticaria]], [[angioedema]], gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.food-info.net/uk/intol/almond.htm Almond allergy on Food info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory pasteurization in California==
Because of two cases of [[salmonellosis]] traced to almonds in 2001 and 2004, the Almond Board of California proposed rules in 2006 regarding [[pasteurization]] of almonds available to the public, and the [[USDA]] approved them. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for the California industry on September 1, 2007, and was implemented voluntarily over the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Controversially, California almonds labeled as &quot;raw&quot; are required to be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with [[propylene oxide]]. This does not apply to imported almonds,&lt;ref&gt;[[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (2006-11-08) &quot;Almonds Grown in California: Changes to Incoming Quality Control Requirements&quot; ({{Federal Register |71 |65373}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65374}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65375}} and {{Federal Register |71 |65376}})&lt;/ref&gt; or to almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is the treatment required for  raw almonds sold as exports to countries outside of North America.

This USDA-approved marketing order has been challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group.  According to the Cornucopia Institute, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. The federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds, but farmers are appealing this decision in August 2009, seeking to have the merits of their arguments heard in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{The Cornucopia Institute. [http://www.cornucopia.org/almonds/]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aaron's rod]] --&gt;
The almond is highly revered in some cultures. In northern Indian state, [[Jammu and Kashmir]], it is designated as the state tree of Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/engl/Prun_dul.html |title=Almond (''Prunus dulcis'') |accessdate=2008-07-18 |last=Katzer |first=Gernot |date=2005-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree grows in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubeileh A, Bruggeman A, Turkelboom F |title=Growing Olives and Other Tree Species in Marginal Arid Environments |publisher=[[ICARDA]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.icarda.org/publications/price_list/book3/Book3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible.

In the Old Testament, the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering, symbolizing God's sudden and rapid punishment of His people; in [[Jeremiah]] 1:11–12, for instance.  In the [[Bible]] the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with [[Book of Genesis]] 43:11, where it is described as &quot;among the best of fruits&quot;. In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17 [[Levi]] is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by [[Aaron's rod]], which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] which stood in the [[Holy Temple]], &quot;Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers&quot;  ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33–34; 37:19–20). Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]]; paintings often include almonds encircling the [[Child Jesus|baby Jesus]] and as a symbol of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. The word &quot;[[Luz]]&quot;, which appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:37, is sometimes translated as &quot;[[hazel]]&quot;, may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the [[NIV]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=g8YSB2K9d1oC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Aramaic+almond&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bUh0oxqLD2&amp;sig=5WxT7GZydOwBr0xzulBblDuZDcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=resultThe meaning of trees: botany, history, healing, lore]'' by Fred Hageneder, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, consumption of almonds is believed to be good for the brain, while the [[China|Chinese]] consider it a symbol of enduring sadness and female beauty{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Antigua and Barbuda}}
The '''politics of Antigua and Barbuda''' takes place in a framework of a [[Federation|federal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]], wherein the [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Sovereign of Antigua and Barbuda]] is the [[head of state]], appointing a [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]] to act as [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representative in the nation. A [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] is appointed by the Governor-General as the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]; the Prime Minister advises the Governor-General on the appointment of a Council of Ministers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.  [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (seventeen-member body appointed by the Governor General) and the House of Representatives (seventeen seats; members are elected by proportional representation to serve five-year terms).

Antigua and Barbuda has a long history of free elections, three of which have resulted in peaceful changes of government. Since the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1951|1951 general election]], the party system has been dominated by the personalist [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers [[Vere Bird|Vere]] and [[Lester Bird]]. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. The [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|most recent elections]] to the House of Representatives were held on 12 March 2009. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] government was re-elected with nine seats and supported by the sole member from Barbuda, affiliated to the [[Barbuda People's Movement]]. The Antigua Labour Party has seven seats in the House of Representatives.

Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
Jurisprudence is based on English [[common law]].

==Executive branch==
As head of state, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.

==Legislative branch==
Antigua and Barbuda elects on national level a [[legislature]]. '''[[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]''' has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]. The '''[[House of Representatives of Antigua and Barbuda|House of Representatives]]''' has 19 members, 17 members elected for a five year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], 1 ex-officio member and 1 Speaker. The '''[[Senate of Antigua and Barbuda|Senate]]''' has 17 appointed members. The prime minister is the leader of the majority party in the House and conducts affairs of state with the cabinet. The prime minister and the cabinet are responsible to the Parliament. Elections must be held at least every five years but may be called by the prime minister at any time.

There are special legislative provisions to account for [[Barbuda]]'s low population relative to that of [[Antigua]]. Barbuda is guaranteed one member of the House of Representatives and two members of the Senate. In addition, there is a [[Barbuda Council]] to govern the internal affairs of the island.

The '''Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force''' is the [[armed force]] of [[Antigua and Barbuda]].

The RABDF consists of four major units:
*1st [[Battalion]], [[Antigua and Barbuda Regiment]] - this is the infantry unit and fighting arm of the defence force.
*Service and Support Unit - established in 1997, this provides administrative, logistic and engineer support to the rest of the defence force.
*Coast Guard - this is the maritime element of the defence force, and is divided into four units:
**Commanding Officer's office
**Engineer Unit
**Administration Unit
**Flotilla - the flotilla is the operational part of the Coast Guard, and consists of four vessels.
*Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps

The RABDF has responsibility for several different roles: internal security, prevention of drug smuggling, the protection and support of fishing rights, prevention of marine pollution, search and rescue, ceremonial duties, assistance to government programs, provision of relief during natural disasters, assistance in the maintenance of essential services and support of the police in maintaining law and order.

The RABDF is the world's smallest military, consisting of 245 people. It is thus much better equipped for fulfilling its civil roles as opposed to providing a deterrence against would-be aggressors or in defending the nation during a war.

==Former Deployments==
* In 1982 14 men of the ''Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force'' were deployed to Grenada during the [[Operation Urgent Fury]].
* 1990 12 soldiers were sent to Trinidad after a failed coup attempt by radical Black Muslims against the constitutionally elected government headed by Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson.
* In the year 1995 members of the ''Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force'' were deployed in Haiti as a Part of [[Operation Uphold Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/antigua/conference/papers/phillips.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
'''Antisemitism''' (also spelled '''anti-semitism''' or '''anti-Semitism''') is &quot;hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.&quot;&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm &quot;Report on Global Anti-Semitism&quot;''], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], January 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In its extreme form, it &quot;attributes to the Jews an exceptional position among all other civilizations, defames them as an inferior group and denies their being part of the nation[s]&quot; in which they reside.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, Bruce F. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PFdSsmxFl7sC&amp;pg=PA1 ''From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism''], University of North Carolina Press, 2002. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who holds such views is called an &quot;antisemite&quot;.
Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from individual expressions of hatred and [[discrimination]] against individual Jews to organized [[pogroms|violent attacks]] by mobs, or even state police, or military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Extreme instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade|First Crusade]] of 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion from England]] in 1290, the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Jews in Portugal|expulsion from Portugal]] in 1497, various [[pogroms]], the [[Dreyfus Affair]], and [[the Holocaust]] by [[Nazi Germany]].

While the term's [[etymology]] might suggest that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic#Ancient Semitic peoples|Semitic peoples]], the term was coined in the late 19th century in Germany as a more scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' (&quot;Jew-hatred&quot;),&lt;ref name=Judenhass&gt;See, for example:
*Jerome A. Chanes. ''[[Antisemitism: A Reference Handbook]]'', [[ABC-CLIO]], 2004, p. 150.

*Rubenstein, Richard L.; Roth, John K. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IfoBx6skMCkC&amp;pg=PA30 ''Approaches to Auschwitz: the Holocaust and its legacy''], [[Westminster John Knox Press]], 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;30.

and that has been its normal use since then.&lt;ref name=JustJews&gt;See, for example:

==Forms==
The [[Roman Catholic]] historian [[Edward Flannery]] distinguished four varieties of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', Stimulus Books, first published 1965, this edition 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2010}}

*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]];
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as anti-Judaism;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.
In addition, from the 1990s, some writers claim to have identified a [[new antisemitism]], a form of antisemitism coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|far left]], the [[far right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to [[Zionism]] and a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]], and which may deploy traditional antisemitism motifs, including older motifs like the &quot;[[Blood Libel]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;New-AS-List&quot;&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
===Usage===
Despite the use of the prefix ''anti-'', the terms ''Semitic'' and ''anti-Semitic'' are not directly opposed to each other. ''Antisemitism'' refers specifically to prejudice against [[Jew]]s alone and in general,&lt;ref name=JustJews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisemitism Antisemitism – Definition and More from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there are other speakers of [[Semitic language]]s (e.g. [[Arab]]s, [[Ethiopians]], or [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) and that not all Jews speak a Semitic language.

The term ''anti-Semitic'' has been used on occasion to include bigotry against other Semitic-language peoples such as Arabs, but such usage is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Matas|Matas, David]]. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 ''Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism''], Dundurn Press, 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Both terms ''anti-Semitism'' and ''antisemitism'' are in common use. Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form ''antisemitism'' to avoid possible confusion involving whether the term refers specifically to Jews, or to [[Semitic]]-language speakers as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf Antisemitism.

===Etymology===
[[Image:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]
Although [[Wilhelm Marr]] is generally credited with coining the word &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; (see below), [[Alex Bein]] writes that the word was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar [[Moritz Steinschneider]] in the phrase &quot;anti-Semitic prejudices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Bein|Bein, Alex]]. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 ''The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem'']. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;594. ISBN 0-8386-3252-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize [[Ernest Renan]]'s ideas about how &quot;[[Semitic]] races&quot; were inferior to &quot;[[Aryan]] races.&quot; These [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and &quot;progress&quot; had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. In Treitschke's writings ''Semitic'' was synonymous with ''Jewish'', in contrast to its use by Renan and others.

In 1873 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet ''&quot;The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective.&quot;'' (''&quot;Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet.&quot;'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]]. [http://www.archive.org/details/DerSiegdesJudenthumsueberdasGermanenthum|Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet.] Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition. Archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used the word ''&quot;Semitismus&quot;'' interchangeably with the word &quot;Judentum&quot; to denote both &quot;Jewry&quot; (the Jews as a collective) and &quot;jewishness&quot; (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit). Although he did not use the word &quot;Antisemitismus&quot; in the pamphlet, the coining of the latter word followed naturally from the word &quot;Semitismus&quot;, and indicated either opposition to the Jews as a people, or else opposition to Jewishness or the Jewish spirit, which he saw as infiltrating German culture. In his next pamphlet, ''&quot;The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit&quot;'', published in 1880, Marr developed his ideas further and coined the related German word ''Antisemitismus'' – ''antisemitism'', derived from the word &quot;Semitismus&quot; that he had earlier used.

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''&quot;League of Antisemites&quot;'' (&quot;''Antisemiten-Liga''&quot;), the first German organization committed specifically to combatting the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''&quot;Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte,&quot;'' and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term &quot;''Antisemiten''&quot; in the January issue of ''&quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;''. The related word ''[[Philo-Semitism|semitism]]'' was coined around 1885.

===Definition===
[[Image:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|right|Antisemitic caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898)]]
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions. Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as &quot;a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions – social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence – which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews.&quot; Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, &quot;Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the antisemites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Avner, Falk. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Anti-semitism: a history and psychoanalysis of contemporary hatred''], [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of &quot;cosmic evil.&quot; Thus, &quot;it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic&quot; unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html &quot;The New Anti-Semitism&quot;], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on March 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The U.S. Department of State defines antisemitism in its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism as &quot;hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.&quot;&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm &quot;Report on Global Anti-Semitism&quot;''], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], January 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed definition: &quot;Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. In addition, such manifestations could also target the [[state of Israel]], conceived as a Jewish collectivity. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for 'why things go wrong'.&quot;

It then listed &quot;contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere.&quot; These included: &quot;Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews; accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]]; and accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. It also listed ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic:
*Denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor;
*Applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation;
*Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis;
*Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis;
*Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.

The definition added that [[criticism of Israel]] cannot be regarded as antisemitism so long as it is &quot;similar to that leveled against any other country.&quot;&lt;ref name=workingdef&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf &quot;Working definition of antisemitism&quot;]|33.8&amp;nbsp;KB}}, EUMC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;[[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]], {{PDFlink|[http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf &quot;Working Definition of Antisemitism&quot;]|33.8&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of usage as a term===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Antisemitic League). Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe in the latter 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. ISBN 0-8143-2055-4&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was &quot;Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9404E7D91E30E333A25752C1A9659C946196D6CF Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', March 11, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, organization, or political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early Zionist pioneer, [[Judah Leib Pinsker]], in a pamphlet written in 1882, said that antisemitism was an inherited predisposition:{{quote|Judeophobia is a psychic aberration. As a psychic aberration it is hereditary, and as a disease transmitted for two thousand years it is incurable.' ... 'In this way have Judaism and Anti-Semitism passed for centuries through history as inseparable companions.'... ...'Having analyzed Judeophobia as an hereditary form of demonopathy, peculiar to the human race, and having represented Anti-Semitism as proceeding from an inherited aberration of the human mind, we must draw the important conclusion that we must give' up contending against these hostile impulses as we must against every other inherited predisposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Auto-Emancipation|''Auto-Emancipation'' by Judah Leib Pinsker]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the aftermath of [[Kristallnacht]], [[Josef Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: &quot;The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', November 12, 1938. Cited in [[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction.'' Harper Collins, 2006, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Hitler]]'s fall from power, and particularly after the extent of the [[Nazi]] [[genocide]] of Jews became known, the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when &quot;Jew&quot; was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.'' Wayne State University Press, 1989, page 286. ISBN 0-8143-2186-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Bein. ''The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, Page 580. ISBN 0-8386-3252-1&lt;/ref&gt; Yehuda Bauer wrote in 1984: &quot;There are no antisemites in the world... Nobody says, 'I am antisemitic.'&quot; You cannot, after Hitler. The word has gone out of fashion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda Bauer]]: ''The Most Ancient Group Prejudice'' in Leo Eitinger (1984): ''The Anti-Semitism of Our Time''. Oslo. Nansen Committee. p.14. citing from: Jocelyn Hellig (2003): ''The Holocaust and Antisemitism: A Short History.'' Oneworld Publications. p.&amp;nbsp;73. ISBN 1-85168-313-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New antisemitism===
{{Main|New antisemitism}}
In recent years some scholars have advanced the concept of ''New antisemitism'', coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;New-AS-List&quot; /&gt; and argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack the Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and attribute this to antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{See|Antisemitism in Europe|New antisemitism}}
Antisemitism has increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. According to a 2004 study, Germany, France, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = &quot;mgjmsp&quot;&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-urban-f04.htm Anti-Semitism In Germany Today: Its Roots And Tendencies – Susanne Urban]&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the new European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spill over from the long running [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = &quot;mgjmsp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University, http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

In 2009, the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]], often referred to as [[Europe|Europe's]] last [[shtetl]], experienced a surge in antisemitic violence. [[Bloeme Evers-Emden]], an Amsterdam resident and [[Auschwitz]] survivor, was quoted in the newspaper [[Aftenposten]] in 2010: &quot;The antisemitism now is even worse than before the [[Holocaust]].

====United Kingdom====

In 2005 the UK Parliament set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. The inquiry stated that &quot;until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society.&quot; It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. It aimed to investigate the problem, identify the sources of contemporary antisemitism and make recommendations to improve the situation. It discussed the influence of the Israel-Palestine conflict and issues of anti-Israel sentiment versus antisemitism at length and noted &quot;most of those who gave evidence were at pains to explain that [[criticism of Israel]] is not to be regarded in itself as antisemitic ... The Israeli government itself may, at times, have mistakenly perceived criticism of its policies and actions to be motivated by antisemitism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism]|430&amp;nbsp;KB}}, All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism, September 2006, accessed 24 November 2010.

On January 1, 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a &quot;tsunami of antisemitism&quot; was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: &quot;A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground – not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because ... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making ... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

====France====
{{See|History of the Jews in France}}
France is home to [[Western Europe]]'s largest [[Muslim]] population ([[Islam in France|about 4 million]]) as well as the continent's largest Jewish community (about 600,000). Jewish leaders decry an intensifying antisemitism in France, mainly among Muslims of [[Arab]] or African heritage, but also growing among [[Caribbean]] islanders from former French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841445.html Jews for Le Pen] by Daniel Ben-Simon.

However, &quot;it is Muslims rather than Jews who can expect to suffer more from bigotry in France&quot;, stated Holocaust survivor and former French cabinet minister [[Simone Veil]]. &quot;Let's not exaggerate,&quot; she said. While noting that radical Islamists are behind some violent incidents against Jews in certain French neighbourhoods, &quot;[[Anti-Arabism|Anti-Arab]] sentiment is much stronger in France than anti-Semitism.&quot; France's Jewish community is much more integrated than its 5 to 6 million Muslims, she noted, claiming Muslim youth are moved by a militant and anti-Jewish hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irwin |last=Block |title=More hatred towards Muslims and Jews in France: Holocaust survivor |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=85ca8e66-a12c-40b0-9ce8-95823057df6c&amp;k=46226 |publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |date=2007-10-13 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] denounced the killing of [[Ilan Halimi]] on 13 February 2006 as an antisemitic crime.

Jewish philanthropist Baron [[Eric de Rothschild]] suggests that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated. In an interview with ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' he says that &quot;the one thing you can't say is that France is an anti-Semitic country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, Leila Hilary.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among Norwegian [[Muslim]]s. Teachers at schools with large shares of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often &quot;praise or admire [[Adolf Hitler]] for his killing of [[Jew]]s&quot;, that &quot;Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students&quot; and that &quot;Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]&quot;. Additionally that &quot;while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews&quot; and that it says in &quot;the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews&quot;. Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly &quot;to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Sweden}}
After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe. Though the Netherlands reports a higher rate of antisemitism in some years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: &quot;The Jews have too much influence in the world today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Five percent of the entire adult population, and 39% of the [[Muslims|Muslim]] population, harbor strong and consistent antisemitic views. Former Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]] described these results as &quot;surprising and terrifying&quot;. However, the Rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden claimed that &quot;It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the [[Palestinians]] to be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922248.html Anti-Semitism, in Sweden? Depends who you're asking], Haaretz, November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, the Swedish publication ''The Local'' published series of articles about the growing anti-Semitism in [[Malmö, Sweden]]. In an interview in January 2010, Fredrik Sieradzki of the Jewish Community of Malmö stated that &quot;Threats against Jews have increased steadily in Malmö in recent years and many young Jewish families are choosing to leave the city. Many feel that the community and local politicians have shown a lack of understanding for how the city's Jewish residents have been marginalized.&quot; He also added that &quot;right now many Jews in Malmö are really concerned about the situation here and don't believe they have a future here.&quot; The Local also reported that Jewish cemeteries and synagogues have repeatedly been defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, and a chapel at another Jewish burial site in Malmö was firebombed in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;thelocal%2525252525252Ese&quot;&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/24632/20100127/ Jews flee Malmö as anti-Semitism grows] by David Landes, The Local, January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Malmö police received reports of 79 anti-Semitic incidents, double the number of the previous year (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7278532/Jews-leave-Swedish-city-after-sharp-rise-in-anti-Semitic-hate-crimes.html Jews leave Swedish city after sharp rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes] Sunday Telegraph. 21 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmo Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. &quot;Malmo is a place to move away from,&quot; he said, citing anti-Semitism as the primary reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;forward.com&quot;&gt;http://www.forward.com/articles/129233/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told ''Die Presse'', an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being &quot;harassed and physically attacked&quot; by &quot;people from the Middle East,&quot; although he added that only a small number of Malmo's 40,000 Muslims &quot;exhibit hatred of Jews.&quot; Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmo to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment. Also in March, the Swedish newspaper ''Skånska Dagbladet'' reported that attacks on Jews in Malmo totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/03/22/1011279/report-anti-semitic-attacks-in-rise-in-scandanavia Report: Anti-Semitic attacks rising in Scandinavia], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), March 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, ''The Forward'' reported on the current state of Jews and the level of Anti-semitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often anti-Semitic—not just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that &quot;Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It's a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.&quot; Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for ''Svenska Dagbladet'', has sharply criticized politicians who  him claims offer &quot;weak excuses&quot; for Muslims accused of anti-Semitic crimes. &quot;Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault.&quot;&lt;ref name=moveaway&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/129233/ For Jews, Swedish City Is a ‘Place To Move Away From’] by Donald Snyder, The Forward, Published July 07, 2010, issue of July 16, 2010.).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmo in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmo schools as part of their Holocaust studies program , but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated that &quot;Malmo reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. &quot;I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;forward.com&quot;/&gt;

In December 2010, the [[Jews|Jewish]] [[human rights]] organization [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express &quot;extreme caution&quot; when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of [[Malmö]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441467&amp;ct=8971903&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
{{See|Arabs and antisemitism}}

Mudar Zahran, a Palestinian, writing for the [[Hudson Institute]] says that &quot;the Palestinians have been used as fuel for the new form of anti-Semitism; this has hurt the Palestinians and exposed them to unprecedented and purposely media-ignored abuse by Arab governments, including some of those who claim love for the Palestinians, yet in fact only bear hatred to Jews. This has resulted in Palestinian cries for justice, equality, freedom and even basic human rights being ignored while the world getting consumed with delegitimizing Israel from either ignorance or malice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson-ny.org/1979/anti-semitism-20 Anti-semitism 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2005 survey by the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]], high percentages of the populations of six Muslim-majority countries have negative views of Jews. In the questionnaire, 60 percent of [[Turkey|Turks]], 88 percent of [[Morocco|Moroccans]], 99 percent of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Muslims and 100 percent of [[Jordan]]ians said they held &quot;somewhat unfavorable&quot; or &quot;very unfavorable&quot; views of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ancient world===
Examples of antipathy to [[Jews]] and [[Judaism]] during [[ancient world|ancient times]] are abundant. Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels. J,L, ''Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period'' in JBL 98 (1979) pp.45–65&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], [[Shabbat]] observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE. [[Philo of Alexandria]] described an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin). &quot;Anti-Semitism.&quot; Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider. Brill, 2008. Brill Online. 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History_of_antisemitism#Late_Roman_Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James P. Carroll|James Carroll]] asserted, &quot;Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

From the 9th century CE, the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] classified Jews (and Christians) as ''[[dhimmi]]'', and allowed them to practice their religion more freely than they could do in [[Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]]. Under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule]], there was a [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]] that lasted until at least the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=María Rosa|last=Menocal|author-link=María Rosa Menocal|title=The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain|date=April 2003|publisher=Back Bay Books|isbn=0316168718}}&lt;/ref&gt; when several Muslim [[pogrom]]s against Jews took place in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; those that occurred in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 1011 and in [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada in 1066]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweitzer267-268&quot;&gt;Schweitzer, Perry (2002) pp. 267–268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harzig, Hoerder &amp; Shubert, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Several decrees ordering the destruction of [[synagogue]]s were also enacted in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]] from the 11th century. Despite the [[Qur'an]]'s prohibition, Jews were also forced to convert to Islam or face death in some parts of Yemen, [[Morocco]] and [[Baghdad]] several times between the 12th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], who had taken control of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]]' [[Maghreb|Maghribi]] and Andalusian territories by 1147,&lt;ref name=islamicworldeb&gt;Islamic world.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]]. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) flourishing communities on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]] [[German Crusade, 1096|were destroyed]]. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade]]s of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all [[English people|English]] Jews; in 1396, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html Why the Jews? – Black Death]&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval and Renaissance Europe, a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders, the Franciscans (especially Bernardino of Feltre) and Dominicans (especially Vincent Ferrer), who combed European promoting antisemitism through their often fiery, emotional appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Chapter Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by the July 6, 1348, [[papal bull]] and an additional bull in 1348, several months later, 900 Jews were burned alive in [[Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

===Seventeenth century===
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in hundreds of thousands. First, the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s [[Cossacks]] massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed.&quot; [http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/religion/judaism/timeline.html Judaism Timeline 1618–1770], ''[[CBS News]]''.

===Eighteenth century===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called &quot;protected&quot; Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the &quot;protected&quot; Jews had an alternative to &quot;either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin&quot; (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that &quot;Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution.&quot;

In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine II]] forced the Jews of the [[Pale of Settlement]] to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th century traveler: &quot;I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.&quot;&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (&quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries (and rivals) [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]]. Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in &quot;The Good Bargain (Der gute Handel)&quot; and &quot;The Jew Among Thorns (Der Jude im Dorn).&quot;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery captain in the French army, was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] at Devil's Island. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides regarding whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of polluting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: eighty percent of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[antiliberal]] political party called The [[Christian Social Party (Germany)]]. However, this party did not attract as many votes as the Nazi party, which flourished in part because of [[The Great Depression]], which hit Germany especially hard during the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold M.

===Twentieth century===

In the first half of the 20th century, in the USA, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrollment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The [[Leo Frank]] lynching by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 Chanes, p.&amp;nbsp;72].&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Richard S. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 ''Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution'' (Volume 1)], [[ABC-CLIO]], p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of blood libel in Europe. Allegations of Jews killing Christians were used as justification for killing of Jews by Christians.

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the interwar period. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Such views were also shared by some prominent politicians; [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that &quot;in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=0253338093 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit he wrote letters saying that there was &quot;more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized.&quot;

The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags. The U.S. [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) was very active in denying the Bund's ability to operate. With the start of U.S. involvement in [[World War II]] most of the Bund's members were placed in [[internment camp]]s, and some were deported at the end of the war.

Sometimes, during race riots, as in [[Detroit]] in 1943, Jewish businesses were targeted for looting and burning.&lt;ref&gt;Capeci Jr., Dominic J.

In Germany, according to the historian [[Hans Mommsen]], there were three types of antisemitism. In a 1997 interview, Mommsen was quoted as saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives — found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration — and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand, and ''völkisch'' antisemitism on the other. The conservative variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a &quot;cultural code.&quot; This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the
repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the ''Reich'' government. This is especially true with respect to Hitler's proclamation of the &quot;racial annihilation war&quot; against the Soviet Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Besides conservative antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunising the Catholic population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany (and elsewhere) is the so-called ''völkisch'' antisemitism or racism, and this is the
foremost advocate of using violence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Germany the [[National Socialist]] regime of [[Adolf Hitler]], who came to power on 30 January 1933, instituted repressive legislation denying the Jews basic civil rights and instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed [[Kristallnacht]], in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to Nazi occupied Europe, in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for personal conflicts in [[USSR|Soviet Russia]], starting from conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy theories spread by official propaganda. Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the [[Rootless cosmopolitan|&quot;rootless cosmopolitan&quot;]] (euphemism for &quot;Jew&quot;) in which numerous Yiddish-writing poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;jcws&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| coauthors=Raphael and Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=0814319483, 9780814319482}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]]. Similar antisemitic propaganda in Poland resulted in the flight of the Polish Jewish survivors from the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot; /&gt;

After the war, the [[Kielce pogrom]] and &quot;[[March 1968 events]]&quot; in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe. The common theme behind the [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946|anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland]] were [[blood libel]] rumours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=4Iiw0KB31rgC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;ots=Se_CvAI3X6&amp;dq=Cracow+Kupa+synagogue+ritual+murder&amp;num=100&amp;sig=0t5WKlHjavg6aVgoL1ertcsPn9U]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5Ceq6l0M0C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;ots=VvcY2-LqLQ&amp;dq=blood+libel+kielce&amp;num=100&amp;sig=JY3EykCZ-dp3x3HoBc1jM2vFzks]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of [[Simon of Trent]] was disbanded in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]], and the shrine erected to him was dismantled. He was removed from the calendar, and his future veneration was forbidden, though a handful of extremists still promote the narrative as a fact.

==Christianity and antisemitism==
{{Main|Religious antisemitism}}
{{Main|Christianity and antisemitism}}

Religious antisemitism is also known as anti-Judaism. As the name implies, it was the practice of [[Judaism]] itself that was the defining characteristic of the antisemitic attacks. Under this version of antisemitism, attacks would often stop if Jews stopped practicing or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion, and sometimes, liturgical exclusion of Jewish converts (the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century convicted of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', Stimulus Books, first published 1985, this edition 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament and antisemitism===
{{Main|Antisemitism in the New Testament}}

Frederick Schweitzer and Marvin Perry write that the authors of the gospel accounts sought to place responsibility for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] and his death on Jews, rather than the Roman emperor or [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer &amp; Perry (2002), pp. 27, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Christians for centuries viewed Jews as &quot;the Christ Killers&quot;.&lt;ref name=SchweitzerPerry2002p18&gt;Schweitzer &amp; Perry (2002), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] was seen as judgment from God to the Jews for that death,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1986), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and Jews were seen as &quot;a people condemned forever to suffer exile and degradation&quot;.&lt;ref name=SchweitzerPerry2002p18/&gt; According to historian [[Edward H. Flannery]], the [[Gospel of John]] in particular contains many verses that refer to Jews in a pejorative manner.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery (2004) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:14–16|31}}, [[Paul (apostle)|Paul]] states that the Churches in Judea had been persecuted by the Jews who killed Jesus and that such people displease God, oppose all men, and had prevented Paul from speaking to the gentile nations concerning the New Testament message. Described by [[Hyam Maccoby]] as &quot;the most explicit outburst against Jews in Paul's Epistles&quot;,&lt;ref name=Maccoby203&gt;[[Hyam Maccoby]], ''The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity'', [[Harper &amp; Row]], 1986, ISBN 0-06-015582-5, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; these verses have repeatedly been employed for antisemitic purposes. Maccoby views it as one of Paul's innovations responsible for creating Christian antisemitism, though he notes that some have argued these particular verses are later interpolations not written by Paul.&lt;ref name=Maccoby203/&gt; [[Craig Blomberg]] argues that viewing them as antisemitic is a mistake, but &quot;understandable in light of [Paul's] harsh words&quot;. In his view, Paul is not condemning all Jews forever, but merely those he believed had specifically persecuted the prophets, Jesus, or the 1st century church. Blomberg sees Paul's words here as no different in kind than the harsh words the prophets of the Old Testament have for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Blomberg]], ''From Pentecost to Patmos: An Introduction to Acts Through Revelation'', [[B&amp;H Publishing Group]], 2006, ISBN 9780805432480, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Codex Sinaiticus]] contains two extra books in the New Testament – the [[Shepherd of Hermas]] and the [[Epistle of Barnabas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The rival to the Bible |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7651105.stm|publisher=BBC News|author=Roger Bolton|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter emphasizes the claim that it was the Jews, not the Romans, who killed Jesus, and is full of antisemitism.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; The Epistle of Barnabas was removed from later versions of the Bible; Professor [[Bart Ehrman]] has stated &quot;the suffering of Jews in the subsequent centuries would, if possible, have been even worse had the Epistle of Barnabas remained&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

===Early Christianity===
A number of early and influential Church works — such as the dialogues of [[Justin Martyr]], the homilies of [[John Chrysostom]], and the testimonies of church father [[Cyprian]] — are strongly anti-Jewish.

During a discussion on the celebration of [[Easter]] during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 CE, Roman emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] said, &lt;blockquote&gt; ...it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. (...) Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way.&lt;ref name=Eusebius&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm &quot;Life of Constantine (Book III)&quot;], 337 CE. Retrieved March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prejudice against Jews in the [[Roman Empire]] was formalized in 438, when the ''Code of [[Theodosius II]]'' established Christianity as the only legal religion in the Roman Empire. The [[Justinian Code]] a century later stripped Jews of many of their rights, and Church councils throughout the 6th and 7th century, including the Council of Orleans, further enforced anti-Jewish provisions. These restrictions began as early as 305, when, in Elvira, (now [[Granada]]), a Spanish town in [[Andalucia]], the first known laws of any church council against Jews appeared. Christian women were forbidden to marry Jews unless the Jew first converted to Catholicism. Jews were forbidden to extend hospitality to Catholics. Jews could not keep Catholic Christian [[concubine]]s and were forbidden to bless the fields of Catholics. In 589, in Catholic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[Third Council of Toledo]] ordered that children born of marriage between Jews and Catholic be baptized by force. By the Twelfth Council of Toledo (681) a policy of forced conversion of all Jews was initiated (Liber Judicum, II.2 as given in Roth).&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;Roth, A. M. Roth, and Roth, Norman. ''Jews, Visigoths and Muslims in Medieval Spain'', Brill Academic, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands fled, and thousands of others converted to Roman Catholicism.

===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===
{{Main|Jews in the Middle Ages|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)}}
Antisemitism was widespread in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. In those times, a main cause of prejudice against Jews in Europe was the religious one. Although not part of [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people [[collective guilt|collectively responsible]] for the death of Jesus, a practice originated by [[Melito of Sardis]].

Among socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed the doors for many professions to the Jews, pushing them into occupations considered socially inferior such as accounting, rent-collecting and [[moneylending]], which was tolerated then as a &quot;[[consequentialism|necessary evil]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds. {{PDFlink|[http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf &quot;A Viewer's Guide to Contemporary Passion Plays&quot;]|74.4&amp;nbsp;KB}}.

[[Image:Judensau Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|left|18th century Frankfurt Judensau]]
German for &quot;Jews' sow&quot;, ''[[Judensau]]'' was the derogatory and dehumanizing imagery of Jews that appeared around the 13th century. Its popularity lasted for over 600 years and was revived by the Nazis. The Jews, typically portrayed in [[obscene]] contact with [[unclean animals]] such as [[pig]]s or [[owl]]s or representing a [[devil]], appeared on [[cathedral]] or [[church (building)|church]] ceilings, pillars, utensils, etchings, etc. Often, the images combined several antisemitic motifs and included derisive prose or poetry.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Dozens of Judensaus... intersect with the portrayal of the Jew as a [[deicide|Christ killer]]. Various illustrations of the murder of [[Simon of Trent]] blended images of Judensau, the [[devil]], the murder of little Simon himself, and the [[Crucifixion]]. In the 17th-century engraving from Frankfurt&lt;ref&gt;Cohen's book includes an earlier variation of the same image.&lt;/ref&gt; ... a well-dressed, very contemporary-looking Jew has mounted the sow backward and holds her tail, while a second Jew sucks at her milk and a third eats her feces. The horned devil, himself wearing a [[Yellow badge|Jewish badge]], looks on and the butchered Simon, splayed as if on a cross, appears on a panel above.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cohen (2007): ''Christ Killers: The Jews and the Passion from the Bible to the Big Screen.''

In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''&quot;[[Merchant of Venice]]&quot;,'' considered to be one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, the villain [[Shylock]] was a Jewish moneylender. By the end of the play he is mocked on the streets after his daughter elopes with a Christian. Shylock, then, compulsorily converts to Christianity as a part of a deal gone wrong. This has raised profound implications regarding Shakespeare and antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berens.org/tikkun.html On Beyond Shylock] by Bradley S. Berens&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, the story of Jephonias,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/pilgr/sources/TransVirginis.html#46 Transitus or Dormitio Virginis], the original 5th or 6th century text&lt;/ref&gt; the Jew who tried to overturn Mary's funeral bier, changed from his converting to Christianity into his simply having his hands cut off by an angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/99an2a.html Self-Description and the Antisemite: Denying Privileged Access]&lt;/ref&gt;

On many occasions, Jews were subjected to [[blood libel against Jews|blood libels]], false accusations of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].
Jews were subject to a wide range of legal restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden.

===19th and 20th century===
{{See also|Christianity and Judaism|Relations between Catholicism and Judaism}}
[[Image:proper hands.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Branford Clarke]] illustration of the KKK against both Jews and Catholics in [[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]] by Bishop [[Alma White]] 1928 Published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, NJ]]]]
Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, the Roman Catholic Church still incorporated strong antisemitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate anti-Judaism, the opposition to the Jewish religion on religious grounds, and racial antisemitism. [[Pope Pius VII]] (1800–1823) had the walls of the Jewish [[Ghetto]] in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were [[Napoleon and the Jews|released by Napoleon]], and Jews were restricted to the Ghetto through the end of the Papal States in 1870.

Additionally, official organizations such as the [[Jesuits]] banned candidates &quot;who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church&quot; until 1946. Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has further argued in his book ''[[The Popes Against the Jews]]'' that in the 19th century and early 20th century the [[Roman Catholic Church]] adhered to a distinction between &quot;good antisemitism&quot; and &quot;bad antisemitism&quot;.

The &quot;bad&quot; kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The &quot;good&quot; kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when accused of promoting hatred of Jews, would remind people that they condemned the &quot;bad&quot; kind of antisemitism. Kertzer's work is not, therefore, without critics; scholar of Jewish-Christian relations [[Rabbi David G. Dalin]], for example, criticized Kertzer in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' for using evidence selectively.

The [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Nostra Aetate]] document, and the efforts of [[Pope John Paul II]] have helped reconcile Jews and Catholicism in recent decades, however. According to Roman Catholic Holocaust scholar [[Michael Phayer]] the Church as a whole recognized its failings during the council when it corrected the traditional beliefs of the Jews having committed deicide and affirmed that they remained God's chosen people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Pius XII, The Holocaust and the Cold War''&quot;, Indiana University Press, p. 252, 2008, ISBN 978-0-253-34930-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis used [[Martin Luther]]'s book, ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'' (1543), to [[Luther_and_antisemitism#Use by the Nazis|claim]] a moral righteousness for their ideology.  Luther even went so far as to advocate the murder of those Jews who refused to convert to Christianity, writing that &quot;we are at fault in not slaying them&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''On the Jews and Their'' ''Lies'', cited in Robert.Michael. &quot;Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews,&quot; ''Encounter'' 46 (Autumn 1985) No.4.343–344&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Church Council of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the largest [[Lutheran]] denomination in the United States and a member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] publicly [[Luther and antisemitism#Recent Lutheran Church responses|rejected]] Luther's antisemitic writings. The document [[Dabru Emet]] was issued by many American Jewish scholars in 2000 as a statement about Jewish-Christian relations. This document says, &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Accusations of deicide===
{{Main|Jewish deicide}}

Though never a part of [[Christian]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people under an [[antisemitic canard]] to be [[collective guilt|collectively responsible]] for [[deicide]], the [[Jewish deicide|killing of Jesus]], whom they believed to be the son of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01111997_p-31_en.html Nostra Aetate: a milestone – Pier Francesco Fumagalli]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this interpretation, the Jews present at Jesus' death as well as the Jewish people collectively and for all time had committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing. The accusation has been the most powerful warrant for antisemitism by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Perry (2002) pp. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Passion play]]s are dramatic stagings representing the trial and death of [[Jesus]] and have historically been used in remembrance of Jesus' death during [[Lent]]. These plays historically blamed the Jews for [[deicide|the death of Jesus]] in a [[polemic]]al fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to [[crucifixion]] and a Jewish leader assuming eternal [[collective guilt]] for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' explains, &quot;for centuries prompted vicious attacks — or [[pogrom]]s — on Europe's Jewish communities&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M.

==Islam and antisemitism==
{{Main|Islam and antisemitism}}
{{See also|Arabs and antisemitism|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}
Various definitions of antisemitism in the context of Islam are given. The extent of antisemitism among Muslims varies depending on the chosen definition:

*Scholars like [[Claude Cahen]] and [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] define it to be the animosity specifically applied to Jews only and do not include discriminations practiced against Non-Muslims in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelomo Dov Goitein&quot;&gt;[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgment in One Volume, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cahen&quot;&gt;&quot;Dhimma&quot; by Claude Cahen in [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordDic&quot;&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion, ''Antisemitism''&lt;/ref&gt; For these scholars, antisemitism in Medieval Islam has been local and sporadic rather than general and endemic [Shelomo Dov Goitein],&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelomo Dov Goitein&quot;/&gt; not at all present [Claude Cahen],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cahen&quot;/&gt; or rarely present.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordDic&quot;/&gt;

*According to [[Bernard Lewis]], antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of &quot;cosmic evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. &quot;The New Anti-Semitism&quot;, The American Scholar, Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at Brandeis University on March 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For Lewis, from the late 19th century, movements appear among Muslims of which for the first time one can legitimately use the technical term antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1984), p.184&lt;/ref&gt; However, he describes demonizing beliefs, anti-Jewish discrimination and systematic humiliations, as an &quot;inherent&quot; part of the traditional Muslim world, even if violent persecutions were relatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1984), p.8, 32–33, 41–45, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jews in Islamic texts===
[[Leon Poliakov]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EncJud&quot;&gt;Poliakov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Laqueur]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur192&quot;/&gt; and [[Jane Gerber]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerber 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that later passages in the [[Qur'an]] contain very sharp attacks on Jews for their refusal to recognize [[Muhammad]] as a [[prophet]] of [[God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EncJud&quot;/&gt; There are also Qur'anic verses, particularly from the earliest Qur'anic [[surah]]s, showing respect for the Jews (e.g. see {{Quran-usc|2|47}}, {{Quran-usc|2|62}})&lt;ref name=&quot;Poliakov (1961), pg. 27&quot;&gt;Poliakov (1961), pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glazov, Jamie, &quot;Symposium: The Koran and Anti-Semitism&quot;, FrontPageMag.com, June 25, 2004. (retrieved May 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and preaching tolerance (e.g. see {{Quran-usc|2|256}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur192&quot;&gt;Laqueur 192&lt;/ref&gt; This positive view tended to disappear in the later Surahs. Taking it all together, the Qur'an differentiates between &quot;good and bad&quot; Jews, Poliakov states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poliakov (1961), pg. 27&quot;/&gt; Laqueur argues that the conflicting statements about Jews in the Muslim holy text has defined [[Arab]] and Muslim attitude towards Jews to this day, especially during periods of rising [[Islamic fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 191&lt;/ref&gt;

During Muhammad's life, Jews lived in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially in and around [[Medina]]. They reportedly{{Weasel-inline|date=March 2011}} refused [[Muhammad]]'s offer for them to convert and accept him as the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;F.E.Peters(2003), p.103&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[F.E. Peters]], they also began to secretly to conspire with Muhammad's enemies in [[Mecca]] to overthrow him (despite having been forced by their conquerors to sign a peace treaty.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sameul&quot;&gt;Samuel Rosenblatt, ''Essays on Antisemitism: The Jews of Islam'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.E.Peters(2003), p.194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), pp.43–44&lt;/ref&gt; After each major battle, Muhammad accused one of the Jewish tribes of treachery and attacked it. Two Jewish tribes were expelled and the last one, the [[Banu Qurayza]], was wiped out after it threw itself on Muhammad's mercy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur192&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (1998), pp.10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Rosenblatt states that these incidents were not part of policies directed exclusively against Jews, and that Muhammad was more severe with Arab pagans than with Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sameul&quot;/&gt;

The attitude towards Jews changed in the course of Muhammad's career{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, as expressed in more positive teachings in the earlier Qur'anic surahs, from the Mecca period, to increasingly hostile and negative ones, characterizing Jews as such, in Medina as the Jewish tribes there refused to submit completely to Muhammad's authority and claims{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. This distinction of periods is crucial to assess the weight of Qur'anic passages.

The words &quot;humility&quot; and &quot;humiliation&quot; occur frequently in the Qur'an and later Muslim literature in relation to Jews. According to Lewis, &quot;This, in Islamic view, is their just punishment for their past rebelliousness, and is manifested in their present impotence between the mighty powers of Christendom and Islam.&quot; The standard Quranic reference to Jews is verse {{Quran-usc|2|61}}: &quot;And remember ye said: &quot;O [[Moses]]! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, and [[onion]]s.&quot; He said: &quot;Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!&quot; They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis p128&quot;&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Two verses later we read: &quot;And remember, Children of [[Israel]], when We made a covenant with you and raised [[Mount Sinai]] before you saying, &quot;Hold tightly to what We have revealed to you and keep it in mind so that you may guard against evil.&quot; But then you turned away, and if it had not been for [[Allah]]'s grace and merecy, you surely would have been among the lost. And you know those among who sinned on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. We said to them, &quot;You will be transformed into despised apes.&quot; So we used them as a warning to their people and to the following generations, as well as a lesson for the Allah-fearing.&quot;(Qur'an {{Quran-usc|2|63}}) The accusation that Jews will ultimately be transformed into apes and pigs is traditionally understood literally and is derived from such Qur'anic and other early Muslim sources.

The Qur'an associates Jews above all with rejection of God's prophets including Jesus and Muhammad, thus explaining their resistance to him personally. (Cf. Surah 2:87–91; 5:59, 61, 70, and 82.) It states that they are, together with outright idolators, the worst and most inveterate enemies of Islam, and thus will not only suffer eternally in Hell but in this world will be the most degraded of the Peoples of the Book, below even Christians, everywhere. (Cf. Surah 5:82; 3:54–56.) It also asserts that Jews believe that they are the sole children of God (Surah 5:18), and that only they will achieve salvation (Surah 2:111). According to the Qur'an, Jews blasphemously claim that [[Ezra]] is the son of God, as [[Christians]] claim Jesus is, (Surah 9:30) and that God's hand is fettered (Surah 5:64 – i.e., that they can freely defy God). Some of those who are Jews,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahud&quot;&gt;Here the Qur'an uses an Arabic expression ''alladhina hadu'' (&quot;those who are Jewish&quot;), which appears in the Qur'an ten times. &quot;Yahud&quot;. ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;pervert words from their meanings&quot;, (Surah 4:44), and because they have committed wrongdoing, God has &quot;forbidden some good things that were previously permitted them&quot;, thus explaining Jewish commandments regarding food, Sabbath restrictions on work, and other rulings as a punishment from God (Surah 4:160). They listen for the sake of mendacity (Surah 5:41), twisting the truth, and practice forbidden usury, and therefore they will receive &quot;a painful doom&quot; (Surah 4:161).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahud&quot;/&gt; The Qur'an gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, &quot;...but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers&quot;(Surah 3:54). In the Muslim view, the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] was an illusion, and thus the supposed Jewish plots against him ended in complete failure.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In numerous verses (Surah 3:63, 71; 4:46, 160–161; 5:41–44, 63–64, 82; 6:92)&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; the Qur'an accuses Jews of deliberately [[tahrif|obscuring and perverting scripture]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gerber p78&quot;&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences with Christianity===
[[Bernard Lewis]] holds that Muslims were not antisemitic in the way Christians were for the most part because:
# The gospels are not part of the educational system in Muslim society and therefore Muslims are not brought up with the stories of [[Jewish deicide]]; on the contrary the notion of deicide is rejected by the Qur'an as a blasphemous absurdity.
# Muhammad and his early followers were not Jews and therefore they did not present themselves as the true Israel or feel threatened by survival of the old Israel.
# The Qur'an was not viewed by Muslims as a fulfillment of the [[Hebrew Bible]], but rather as a restorer of its original messages that had been distorted over time. Thus no clash of interpretations between Judaism and Islam could arise.
# Muhammad was not killed by the Jewish community and he was victorious in the clash with the Jewish community in Medina.
# Muhammad did not claim to have been Son of God or Messiah but only a prophet; a claim which Jews repudiated less.
# Muslims saw the conflict between Muhammad and the Jews as something of minor importance in Muhammad's career.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p.117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of Jews under Muslim rule===
Traditionally Jews living in Muslim lands, known (along with Christians) as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and to administer their internal affairs but subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gerber p10,20&quot;&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gerber p10,20&quot;/&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The most degrading one was the requirement of [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], not found in the Qur'an or hadith but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]]; its enforcement was highly erratic.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p.131; (1984), pp.8,62&lt;/ref&gt;

The notable examples of massacre of Jews include the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred most of the Jewish population of the city. &quot;More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Gottheil-1906&quot;&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule. There was also the killing or forcibly conversion of them by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 52; Stillman (1979), p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters ([[mellah]]s) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Most conversions were voluntary and happened for various reasons. However, there were some forced conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of North Africa and [[al-Andalus]] as well as in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.17,18,94,95; Stillman (1979), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-modern times===
The portrayal of the Jews in the early Islamic texts played a key role in shaping the attitudes towards them in the Muslim societies. According to [[Jane Gerber]], &quot;the Muslim is continually influenced by the theological threads of anti-Semitism embedded in the earliest chapters of Islamic history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In the light of the Jewish defeat at the hands of Muhammad, Muslims traditionally viewed Jews with contempt and as objects of ridicule. Jews were seen as hostile, cunning, and vindictive, but nevertheless weak and ineffectual. Cowardice was the quality most frequently attributed to Jews. Another stereotype associated with the Jews was their alleged propensity to trickery and deceit. While most anti-Jewish polemicists saw those qualities as inherently Jewish, [[Ibn Khaldun]] attributed them to the mistreatment of Jews at the hands of the dominant nations. For that reason, says ibn Khaldun, Jews &quot;are renowned, in every age and climate, for their wickedness and their slyness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslim writers have inserted racial overtones in their anti-Jewish polemics. [[Al-Jahiz]] speaks of the deterioration of the Jewish stock due to excessive inbreeding. [[Ibn Hazm]] also implies racial qualities in his attacks on the Jews. However, these were exceptions, and the racial theme left little or no trace in the medieval Muslim anti-Jewish writings.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Jewish sentiments usually flared up at times of the Muslim political or military weakness or when Muslims felt that some Jews had overstepped the boundary of humiliation prescribed to them by the Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 130; Gerber (1986), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Iberia]], ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on the latter allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when &quot;[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;Gottheil-1906&quot;/&gt; and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic law does not differentiate between Jews and Christians in their status as dhimmis. According to [[Bernard Lewis]], the normal practice of Muslim governments until modern times was consistent with this aspect of [[sharia]] law.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lewis p128&quot;/&gt; This view is countered by Jane Gerber, who maintains that of all dhimmis, Jews had the lowest status. Gerber maintains that this situation was especially pronounced in the latter centuries, when Christian communities enjoyed protection, unavailable to the Jews, under the provisions of [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. For example, in 18th century [[Damascus]], a Muslim noble held a festival, inviting to it all social classes in descending order, according to their social status: the Jews outranked only the peasants and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, when the equality of all subjects of the Ottoman Empire was proclaimed, [[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]], a high-ranking official observed: &quot;whereas in former times, in the Ottoman State, the communities were ranked, with the Muslims first, then the Greeks, then the Armenians, then the Jews, now all of them were put on the same level. Some Greeks objected to this, saying: 'The government has put us together with the Jews. We were content with the supremacy of Islam.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 136–137; Gerber (1986), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have questioned the correctness of the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; to Muslim culture in pre-modern times.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahen, Cl. &quot;[http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1823 ḎH̲imma.]&quot; Encyclopaedia of Islam.

===Nineteenth century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that in the 19th century the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt; and in 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1840, the [[History of the Jews in Syria|Jews of Damascus]] were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having [[blood libel|used their blood]] to bake [[Matzo|Passover bread]] or Matza. A Jewish barber was tortured until he &quot;confessed&quot;; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jews of Libya]] were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in [[Marrakech]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in [[Morocco]]. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in [[Tunis]], and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on [[Djerba|Jerba Island]]. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1891, the leading Muslims in [[Jerusalem]] asked the Ottoman authorities in [[Constantinople]] to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving from Russia. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in [[Tripolitania]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

[[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th century traveler: &quot;I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.&quot;&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

According to [[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]] in ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'', most scholars conclude that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the 19th century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamized&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]] (2002), p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===

{{See also|Jewish exodus from Arab lands}}

The massacres of Jews in Muslim countries continued into the 20th century. Martin Gilbert writes that 40 Jews were murdered in [[Taza]], Morocco in 1903. In 1905, old laws were revived in [[Yemen]] forbidding Jews from raising their voices in front of Muslims, building their houses higher than Muslims, or engaging in any traditional Muslim trade or occupation.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt; The Jewish quarter in Fez was almost destroyed by a Muslim mob in 1912.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt; There were [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s (see [[Farhud]]). Pro-Nazi Muslims slaughtered dozens of Jews in Baghdad in 1941.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to several factors, including the breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a larger role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment against Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.&lt;ref name=Gruen&gt;Gruen, George E. [http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm &quot;The Other Refugees: Jews of the Arab World&quot;], ''The Jerusalem Letter'', [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], June 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonism and violence increased still further as resentment against [[Zionism|Zionist]] efforts in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] spread. [[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]] propaganda in the Middle East frequently adopts the terminology and symbols of the Holocaust to [[Demonization|demonize]] Israel and its leaders. At the same time, Holocaust denial and Holocaust minimization efforts have found increasingly overt acceptance as sanctioned historical discourse in a number of Middle Eastern countries. Arabic- and Turkish-editions of Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' have found an audience in the region with limited critical response by local intellectuals and media. See [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]].

According to [[Robert Satloff]], Muslims and Arabs were involved both as rescuers and as perpetrators of the Holocaust during pro-Nazi rule of Vichy in French North Africa, and during Italian and German Nazi occupation of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/1073 Righteous Muslims. A briefing by Robert Satloff] by Rachel Silverman, ''Jewish Exponent'', December 14, 2006 ([[Middle East Forum]], December 11, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial antisemitism==
{{Main|Racial antisemitism}}
[[Racial antisemitism]] is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-&quot;Europeans&quot; as inferior. It more specifically claims that the &quot;Nordic&quot; Europeans are superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their &quot;alien&quot; extra-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion. Anthropologists discussed whether the Jews possessed any Arabic-[[Armenoid]], African-[[Nubian people|Nubian]] or Asian-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ancestries. Since [[World War II]] racial antisemitism has rarely appeared outside of [[Neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacist]] movements.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of eugenics, and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.

[[Azerbaijan]] is an economy that has completed its post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy (with the completion of the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline]]), from one where the state played the major role. Azeri GDP grew 41.7% in the first quarter of 2007, possibly the highest of any nation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbcnews.com/free/20070403193147.shtml |title=RosBusinessConsulting - News Online |publisher=Rbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such rates cannot be sustained, but despite reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest [[GDP]] growth in the world in 2005 only to [[Equatorial Guinea]]), and 2006 over 34.6% (world highest), in 2008 dropped to 10.8%, and dropped further to 9.3% in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/business/51114.html Today.az &quot;GDP growth makes 3.4% in Azerbaijan in 2009&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The real GDP growth rate for 2011 is expected at 3.7%&lt;ref name=&quot;indexmundi&quot;&gt;[http://www.indexmundi.com/azerbaijan/gdp_real_growth_rate.html Indexmundi Azerbaijan GDP - real growth rate]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Large [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves are a major contributor to the economy. The national currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat]], was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.

Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind [[macroeconomic]] stabilization. The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms. The government has largely completed [[privatization]] of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the economic activity in the country is regulated by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic]].

==Macro-economic trend==
The following is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Azerbaijan at market prices&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 estimated] by the International Monetary Fund&lt;/ref&gt; with figures in millions of Manats.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Year || Gross domestic product || US dollar exchange || Per capita income&lt;br /&gt; (as % of USA)
|-
| 1995 || 10,669,000 || 4,414.14 Manats || 1.13
|-
| 2000 || 23,590,500 || 4,473.82 Manats || 1.87
|-
| 2005 || 79,378,500 || 4,727.21 Manats || 3.74
|}

For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar was exchanged at 1,565.88 Manats only. Currently, the new Manat is in use, with an exchange rate of about 1 manat = $1.10. Mean graduate pay was $5.76 per manhour in 2010.

For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been [[petroleum]], which represented 10 percent of Azerbaijan’s GDP in 2005, and is projected to double to almost 20 percent of GDP in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=13024 Azerbaijan: Energy profile]'' (Enerpub, 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Now that Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven [[oil reserves]] in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Basin]], which Azerbaijan shares with [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Iran]], and [[Turkmenistan]], are comparable in size to the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], although exploration is still in the early stages.

==External trade==
[[Image:2006Azerbaijani exports.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Azerbaijani exports in 2006]]
Azerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with various oil companies. An export pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from [[Baku]] through [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to [[Ceyhan]], [[Turkey]] (the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline]]) became operational in 2006. The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in revenues for the country over the next 30 years. The recent high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijan's economy as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom. Eastern Caspian producers in cara was here Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their production. In March 2001, Azerbaijan concluded a [[gas]] agreement with Turkey, providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.

In 2002 the Azerbaijani [[merchant marine]] had 54 ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Azerbaijan Transportation | publisher = NationsEncyclopedia.com| url = http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Azerbaijan-TRANSPORTATION.html| accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:SV100067.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Downtown Baku.]]
[[Image:Azeri Square.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The National Bank.]]
Through the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been more developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less diversified, as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector. With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in early 1990s until nowadays.

Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by [[BP]]. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d. People visit petroleum spas (or &quot;oil spas&quot;) to bathe in the local crude in [[Naftalan, Azerbaijan|Naftalan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/28/news/journal.php Azerbaijani answer to oil glut: Bathe in it - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A leading [[caviar]] producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's [[fishing industry]] today is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of [[sturgeon]] and [[beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]] in the [[Caspian Sea]].

Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a [[command economy|command]] to a [[market economy]], but its energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building up with Turkey, Iran, UAE, and the countries of EU. Azerbaijan is also a member of the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO). Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices and the location of new pipelines in the region.
In 2010, Azerbaijan entered into top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU countries with € 9.46 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://today.az/news/business/82397.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==
Azerbaijan faces serious environmental challenges. Soil throughout the region was contaminated by [[DDT]] and toxic [[defoliant]]s used in cotton production during the Soviet era. Caspian petroleum and petrochemicals industries also have contributed to present air and water pollution problems. Several environmental organizations exist in Azerbaijan, yet few funds have been allocated to begin the necessary cleanup and prevention programs. Over-fishing by poachers is threatening the survival of Caspian [[sturgeon]] stocks, the source of most of the world's supply of caviar. The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES) has listed as threatened all sturgeon species, including all commercial Caspian varieties. In 2007 the Blacksmith Institute listed [[Sumgayit]] as one of the ten most polluted cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Bryan (2007) [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1661031_1661028_1661024,00.html &quot;The World's Most Polluted Places&quot;] ''Time Magazine'', accessed 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (14 September 2007) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6995621.stm &quot;Ten 'most polluted places' named&quot;] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting 2007 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey, the capital of Azerbaijan, [[Baku]], was the world's lowest-ranking city for health and sanitation;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1268710 &quot;Go Figure: Mercer issues 2007 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey&quot;] Mercer Human Resource Consulting&lt;/ref&gt; however, by 2010 Baku had pulled itself up 4 index points and its place was taken by [[Port-au-Prince]] in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercer.com/summary.htm?idContent=138133 &quot;Pesquisa Mercer 2010: classificação mundial de Qualidade de Vida nas cidades&quot;] Mercer Human Resource Consulting, in Portuguese, accessed 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversification==
[[Image:Baku pipelines.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]] (green) is one of several pipelines running from Baku.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}]]
In 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 per cent of the Azerbaijani economy. Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.

==Business environment==
In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as the top reformer by the [[World Bank]]'s [[Doing Business report]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Features/Feature-2008-21.aspx |title=Top 10 reformers from Doing Business 2009 |accessdate=2008-09-28 |author=World Bank Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Azerbaijan led the world as the top reformer in 2007/08, with improvements on seven out of 10 indicators of regulatory reform. Azerbaijan started operating a one-stop shop in January 2008 that halved the time, cost, and number of procedures to start a business. Business registrations increased by 40% in the first 6 months. Azerbaijan also eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of $1,100, more than doubling the number of borrowers covered at the credit registry. Also, taxpayers can now file and pay their taxes online. Azerbaijan’s extensive reforms moved it far up the ranks, from 97 to 33 in the overall ease of doing business.}}

'''[[Azerbaijan]]''' is situated in the [[Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]].  Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the [[Caspian Sea]], whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the [[Greater Caucasus]] mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center. About the size of [[Portugal]] or the state of [[Maine]], Azerbaijan has a total land
