===APL2===
Starting in the early 1980s, IBM APL development, under the leadership of Dr [[Jim Brown (Computer Scientist)|Jim Brown]], implemented a new version of the APL language which contained as its primary enhancement the concept of ''nested arrays'', where an array can contain other arrays, as well as new language features which facilitated the integration of nested arrays into program workflow. Ken Iverson, no longer in control of the development of the APL language, left IBM and joined [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], where one of his major contributions was directing the evolution of Sharp APL to be more in accordance with his vision.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As other vendors were busy developing APL interpreters for new hardware, notably [[Unix]]-based [[microcomputer]]s, APL2 was almost always the standard chosen for new APL interpreter developments. Even today, most APL vendors cite APL2 compatibility, which only approaches 100%, as a selling point for their products.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''APL2'' for IBM mainframe computers is still available today, and was first available for [[Conversational Monitor System|CMS]] and [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Microcomputers===
The first microcomputer implementation of APL was on the [[Intel 8008|8008]]-based [[MCM/70]], the first general purpose personal computer, in 1973.

IBM's own [[IBM 5100]] microcomputer (1975) offered APL as one of two built-in ROM-based interpreted languages for the computer, complete with a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language.

In 1976 DNA Systems introduced an APL interpreter for their TSO Operating System which ran timesharing on the IBM 1130, Digital Scientific Meta-4, General Automation GA 18/30 and Computer Hardware CHI 21/30.

The [[VideoBrain Family Computer]], released in 1977, only had one programming language available for it and that was a dialect of APL called APL/S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=videobrain+family+computer+apl/s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_tmStYA0UG&amp;sig=mxb5bqgWuA_NBVww1ywhpA1iNWY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rleIS8_hPN2mtgez8vi0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=videobrain%20family%20computer%20apl%2Fs&amp;f=false &quot;VideoBrain Family Computer&quot;], ''[[Popular Science]]'', November 1978, advertisement.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Small APL for the Intel 8080 called EMPL was released in 1977, and Softronics APL, with most of the functions of full APL, for 8080-based CP/M systems was released in 1979.

In 1977, the Canadian firm Telecompute Integrated Systems, Inc. released a business-oriented APL interpreter known as TIS APL, for Z80-based systems. It featured the full set of file functions for APL, plus a full screen input and switching of right and left arguments for most dyadic operators by introducing ~. prefix to all single character dyadic functions such as - or /.

Vanguard APL was available for [[Z80]] [[CP/M]]-based processors in the late 1970s. [[The Computer Company|TCC]] released APL.68000 in the early 1980s for Motorola [[68000]]-based processors, this system being the basis for MicroAPL Limited's [[APLX]] product. I. P. Sharp Associates released a version of their APL interpreter for the IBM PC and [[PC/370]]&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Donald S., [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382167.383025 &quot;PC/370 virtual machine&quot;], ''ACM SIGSMALL/PC Notes'', Volume 11, Issue 3  (August 1985), pp.23 - 28, 1985.
&lt;/ref&gt; - for the IBM PC, an [[emulator]] was written which facilitated reusing much of the IBM 370 mainframe code.  Arguably, the best known APL interpreter for the IBM Personal Computer was [[Scientific Time Sharing Corporation|STSC]]'s APL*Plus/PC.

The [[Commodore PET|Commodore SuperPET]], introduced in 1981, included an APL interpreter developed by the [[University of Waterloo]].

In the early 1980s, the Analogic Corporation developed ''The APL Machine'', which was an [[Vector processor|array processing]] computer designed to be programmed only in APL.  There were actually three processing units, the user's workstation, an [[IBM PC]], where programs were entered and edited, a [[Motorola 6800]] processor which ran the APL interpreter, and the Analogic array processor which executed the primitives.  At the time of its introduction The APL Machine was likely the fastest APL system available.  Although a technological success, The APL Machine was a marketing failure.  The initial version supported a single process at a time.  At the time the project was discontinued, the design had been completed to allow multiple users.  As an aside, an unusual aspect of The APL Machine was that the library of workspaces was organized such that a single function or variable which was shared by many workspaces existed only once in the library.  Several of the members of The APL Machine project had previously spent a number of years with Burroughs implementing ''APL\700''.

At one stage, [[Microsoft Corporation]] planned to release a version of APL, but these plans never materialized.

An early 1978 publication of [[Rodnay Zaks]] from [[Sybex]] was ''A microprogrammed APL implementation'' ISBN 0895880059 which is the complete, total source listing for the microcode for a Digital Scientific Corporation Meta 4 microprogrammable processor implementing APL.  This may have been the substance of his PhD thesis.

==Overview==

Over a very wide set of problem domains (math, science, engineering, computer design, robotics, data visualization, actuarial science, traditional DP, etc.) APL is an extremely powerful, expressive and concise programming language, typically set in an interactive environment.  It was originally created, among other things, as a way to describe computers, by expressing [[mathematical notation]] in a rigorous way that could be interpreted by a computer.  It is easy to learn but some APL programs can take some time to understand, especially for a newcomer.  Few other programming languages offer the comprehensive array functionality of APL.

Unlike traditionally structured programming languages, code in APL is typically structured as chains of [[unary operation|monadic]] or [[binary operation|dyadic]] [[function (programming)|functions]] and [[Higher-order_function|operator]]s acting on [[array data type|arrays]].  As APL has many nonstandard ''primitives'' (functions and operators, indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols), it does not have function or [[operator precedence]].  Early APL implementations did not have [[control flow|control structures]] (do or while loops, if-then-else), but by using array operations, usage of [[structured programming]] constructs was just not necessary.  For example, the iota function (which yields a one-dimensional array, or vector, from 1 to N) can replace for-loop [[iteration]].  More recent implementations of APL generally include comprehensive control structures, so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated.

The APL environment is called a '''workspace'''. In a workspace the user can define programs and data, i.e. the data values exist also outside the programs, and the user can manipulate the data without the necessity to define a program.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;N \leftarrow  4\ 5\ 6\ 7&lt;/math&gt;

assigns the [[coordinate vector|vector]] values  4 5 6 7 to N;

:&lt;math&gt;N+4\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

adds 4 to all values (giving 8  9 10 11) and prints them (a return value not assigned at the end of a statement to a variable using the assignment arrow &lt;math&gt;\leftarrow &lt;/math&gt; is displayed by the APL interpreter);

:&lt;math&gt;+/N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

prints the sum of N, i.e. 22.

The user can save the workspace with all values, programs and execution status.

APL is well-known for its use of a set of non-[[ASCII]] symbols which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation.  Having single character names for [[Single Instruction Multiple Data|SIMD]] vector functions is one way that APL enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing [[Conway's Game of Life]] in one line of code ([http://catpad.net/michael/apl example]).  In nearly all versions of APL, it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression, that is, in one line of code.

Because of its condensed nature and non-standard characters, APL has sometimes been termed a &quot;[[write-only language]]&quot;, and reading an APL program can at first feel like decoding [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].  Because of the unusual [[character set]], many programmers use special [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] with APL keytops for authoring  APL code.  Although there are various ways to write APL code using only ASCII characters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/apl_archives/apl/translit.schemes Dickey, Lee, A list of APL Transliteration Schemes], 1993&lt;/ref&gt; in practice, it is almost never done. (This may be thought to support Iverson's thesis about [[Linguistic relativity|notation as a tool of thought]].)&lt;ref&gt;Iverson K.E.,&quot;[http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf Notation as a tool of thought]&quot;, ''Communications of the ACM'', 23: 444-465 (August 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; Most if not all modern implementations use standard keyboard layouts, with special mappings or [[input method editor]]s to access non-ASCII characters.  Historically, the APL font has been distinctive, with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols.  Most vendors continue to display the APL character set in a custom font.

Advocates of APL claim that the examples of so-called write-only code are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes, which can occur in any language.  Advocates of APL also claim that they are far more productive with APL than with more conventional computer languages, and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology.  APL lets an individual solve harder problems faster.  Also, being compact and terse, APL lends itself well to larger scale software development as complexity arising from a large number of lines of code can be dramatically reduced.  Many APL advocates and practitioners view programming in standard programming languages, such as  [[COBOL]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], as comparatively tedious.  APL is often found where time-to-market is important, such as with trading systems.

Iverson later designed the [[J programming language]] which uses [[ASCII]] with [[digraph (computing)|digraphs]] instead of special symbols.

==Execution==
===Interpreters===
Today, most APL language activity takes place under the Microsoft Windows operating system, with some activity under [[Linux]], [[Unix]], and [[Mac OS]].  Comparatively little APL activity takes place today on mainframe computers.

APLNext (formerly APL2000) offers an advanced APL interpreter which operates under Linux, Unix, and Windows.  It supports Windows automation, supports calls to operating system and user defined DLLs, has an advanced APL File System, and represents the current level of APL language development.  APL2000's product is an advanced continuation of [[Scientific Time Sharing Corporation|STSC]]'s successful APL*Plus/PC and APL*Plus/386 product line.

''Dyalog APL'' is an advanced APL interpreter which operates under Linux, Unix, and Windows.  Dyalog has innovative extensions to the APL language which include new [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] features, numerous language enhancements, plus a consistent [[namespace]] model used for both its Microsoft Automation interface, as well as native namespaces.  For the Windows platform, Dyalog APL offers tight integration with Microsoft .Net, plus limited integration with the Microsoft Visual Studio development platform.

IBM offers a version of IBM APL2 for IBM AIX, Linux, Sun Solaris and Windows systems.  This product is a continuation of APL2 offered for IBM mainframes.  IBM APL2 was arguably the most influential APL system, which provided a solid implementation standard for the next set of extensions to the language, focusing on nested arrays.

NARS2000 is an open source APL interpreter written by Bob Smith, a well-known APL developer and implementor from [[STSC]] in the 1970s and 1980s.  NARS2000 contains advanced features and new datatypes, runs natively under Windows (32- and 64-bit versions), and runs under [[Linux]] and Apple [[Mac OS]] with [[Wine (software)|Wine]].

MicroAPL Limited offers [[APLX]], a full-featured 64 bit interpreter for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and Apple [[Mac OS]] systems. The core language is closely modelled on IBM's APL2 with various enhancements. ''APLX'' includes close integration with .NET, Java, Ruby and R.

[[Soliton Incorporated]] offers the SAX interpreter (Sharp APL for Unix) for Unix and Linux systems, which is a further development of I. P. Sharp Associates' Sharp APL product.  Unlike most other APL interpreters, [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] had some influence in the way nested arrays were implemented in Sharp APL and SAX.  Nearly all other APL implementations followed the course set by IBM with APL2, thus some important details in Sharp APL differ from other implementations.

===Compilers===
APL programs are normally [[interpreted language|interpreted]] and less often [[compiled language|compiled]].  In reality, most APL compilers [[translated]] source APL to a lower level language such as [[C (Programming Language)|C]], leaving the machine-specific details to the lower level compiler.  Compilation of APL programs was a frequently discussed topic in conferences.  Although some of the newer enhancements to the APL language such as nested arrays have rendered the language increasingly difficult to compile, the idea of APL compilation is still under development today.

In the past, APL compilation was regarded as a means to achieve execution speed comparable to other mainstream languages, especially on mainframe computers.
Several APL compilers achieved some levels of success, though comparatively little of the development effort spent on APL over the years went to perfecting compilation into machine code.

As is the case when moving APL programs from one vendor's APL interpreter to another, APL programs invariably will require changes to their content.  Depending on the compiler, variable declarations might be needed, certain language features would need to be removed or avoided, or the APL programs would need to be cleaned up in some way.  Some features of the language, such as the execute function (an expression evaluator) and the various [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]] and [[introspection (computer science)|introspection]] functions from APL, such as the ability to return a function's text or to materialize a new function from text, are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation.

A commercial compiler was brought to market by [[Scientific Time Sharing Corporation|STSC]] in the mid 1980s as an add-on to IBM's VSAPL Program Product.  Unlike more modern APL compilers, this product produced machine code which would execute only in the interpreter environment, it was not possible to eliminate the interpreter component.  The compiler could compile many scalar and vector operations to machine code, but it would rely on the APL interpreter's services to perform some more advanced functions, rather than attempt to compile them.  However, dramatic speedups did occur, especially for heavily iterative APL code.

Around the same time, the book ''[[An APL Compiler]]'' by [[Timothy Budd]] appeared in print.  This book detailed the construction of an APL translator, written in [[C (programming language)|C]], which performed certain optimizations such as [[loop fusion]] specific to the needs of an array language.  The source language was APL-like in that a few rules of the APL language were changed or relaxed to permit more efficient compilation.  The translator would emit C code which could then be compiled and run well outside of the APL workspace.

Today, execution speed is less critical and many popular languages are implemented using [[virtual machines]] - instructions that are interpreted at runtime. The Burroughs/Unisys '''APLB''' interpreter (1982) was the first to use dynamic incremental compilation to produce code for an APL-specific virtual machine.  It recompiled on-the-fly as identifiers changed their functional meanings.  In addition to removing [[parsing]] and some error checking from the main execution path, such compilation also streamlines the repeated entry and exit of user-defined functional operands. This avoids the stack setup and take-down for function calls made by APL's built-in operators such as Reduce and Each.

'''APEX''', a research APL compiler, is available from [[Snake Island Research Inc]].  APEX compiles flat APL (a subset of ISO N8485) into [[SAC programming language|SAC]], a functional array language with parallel semantics, and currently runs under [[Linux]].  APEX-generated code uses [[loop fusion]] and [[array contraction]], special-case algorithms not generally available to interpreters (e.g., upgrade of [[permutation vector]]), to achieve a level of performance comparable to that of [[Fortran]].

The APLNext '''VisualAPL''' system is a departure from a conventional APL system in that VisualAPL is a true .Net language which is fully inter-operable with other [[Microsoft .NET Framework|.Microsoft .Net]] languages such as [[VB.Net]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].  VisualAPL is inherently object oriented and Unicode-based. While VisualAPL incorporates most of the features of standard APL implementations, the VisualAPL language extends standard APL to be .Net-compliant.  VisualAPL is hosted in the standard Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and as such, invokes compilation in a manner identical to that of other .Net languages. By producing .Net common language runtime (CLR) code, it utilizes the Microsoft just-in-time compiler (JIT) to support 32-bit or 64-bit hardware. Substantial performance speed-ups over standard APL have been reported,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} especially when (optional) strong typing of function arguments is used.

An APL to [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] translator is available from [[Causeway Graphical Systems]].  This product was designed to allow the APL code, translated to equivalent C#, to run completely outside of the APL environment.  The Causeway compiler requires a run-time library of array functions.  Some speedup, sometimes dramatic, is visible, but happens on account of the optimisations inherent in Microsoft's [[Microsoft .NET|.Net]] framework.

A source of links to existing compilers is at [http://www.apl2c.de/home/Links/links.html APL2C].

===Matrix optimizations===
APL was unique in the speed with which it could perform complicated matrix operations.  For example, a very large matrix multiplication would take only a few seconds on a machine which was much less powerful than those today{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.  There were both technical and economic reasons for this advantage:
*  Commercial interpreters delivered highly-tuned linear algebra library routines.
*  Very low interpretive overhead was incurred per-array—not per-element.
*  APL response time compared favorably to the runtimes of early optimizing compilers.
*  IBM provided [[microcode]] assist for APL on a number of IBM/370 mainframes.

Phil Abrams' much-cited paper &quot;An APL Machine&quot; illustrated how APL could make effective use of [[lazy evaluation]] where calculations would not actually be performed until the results were needed and then only those calculations strictly required.  An obvious (and easy to implement) lazy evaluation is the ''J-vector'' : when a monadic ''iota'' is encountered in the code, it is kept as a representation instead of being expanded in memory; in future operations, a ''J-vector'''s contents are the loop's induction register, not reads from memory.

Although such techniques were not widely used by commercial interpreters, they exemplify the language's best survival mechanism: not specifying the order of scalar operations or the exact contents of memory.  As standardized, in 1983 by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[working group]] X3J10, APL remains highly [[data parallelism|data-parallel]].  This gives language implementers immense freedom to schedule operations as efficiently as possible.  As computer innovations such as [[cache memory]], and [[SIMD]] execution became commercially available, APL programs ported with almost no extra effort spent re-optimizing low-level details.

==Terminology==
APL makes a clear distinction between ''functions'' and ''operators''. Functions take arrays (variables or constants or expressions) as arguments, and return arrays as results. Operators (similar to [[higher-order function]]s) take functions or arrays as arguments, and derive related functions. For example the &quot;sum&quot; function is derived by applying the &quot;reduction&quot; operator to the &quot;addition&quot; function. Applying the same reduction operator to the &quot;maximum&quot; function (which returns the larger of two numbers) derives a function which returns the largest of a group (vector) of numbers. In the J language, Iverson substituted the terms 'verb' &amp; ('adverb' or 'conjunction') for 'function' and 'operator'.

APL also identifies those features built into the language, and represented by a symbol, or a fixed combination of symbols, as ''primitives''. Most primitives are either functions or operators. Coding APL is largely a process of writing non-primitive functions and (in some versions of APL) operators. However a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators, most noticeably assignment.

==Syntax==
{{Main|APL syntax and symbols}}
===Examples===
This displays &quot;Hello, world&quot;:

 'Hello, world'

This following immediate-mode expression generates a typical set of Pick 6 [[lottery]] numbers: six [[pseudo-random]] [[integer]]s ranging from 1 to 40, ''guaranteed non-repeating'', and displays them sorted in ascending order:

 x[⍋x←6?40]

This combines the following APL functions:

* The first to be executed (APL executes from right to left) is the dyadic function &quot;?&quot; (named &quot;Deal&quot; when dyadic) that returns a [[Array data structure|vector]] consisting of a select number (left argument: 6 in this case) of random integers ranging from 1 to a specified maximum (right argument: 40 in this case), which, if said maximum ≥ vector length, is guaranteed to be non-repeating.
* This vector is then assigned to the variable x, because it is needed later.
* This vector is then sorted in ascending order by the monadic &quot;⍋&quot; function, which has as its right argument everything to the right of it up to the next unbalanced close-bracket or close-parenthesis. The result of ⍋ is the indices which will put its argument into ascending order.
* Then the output of ⍋ is applied to the variable x which we saved earlier, and it puts the items of x into ascending sequence.

Since there is no function to the left of the first x to tell APL what to do with the result, it simply outputs it to the display (on a single line, separated by spaces) without needing any explicit instruction to do that.

(Note that &quot;?&quot; also has a monadic equivalent called &quot;Roll&quot; which simply returns a single random integer between 1 and its sole operand [to the right of it], inclusive. Thus, a [[Role-Playing Game]] program might use the expression &quot;?20&quot; to roll a twenty-sided die.)

The following expression [[sorting|sorts]] a word list stored in matrix X according to word length:

 X[⍋X+.≠' ';]

The following function &quot;life&quot;, written in Dyalog APL, takes a boolean matrix and calculates the new generation according to [[Conway's Game of Life]]. It demonstrates the power of APL to implement a complex algorithm in very little code, but it is also very hard to follow unless one has an advanced knowledge of APL.

[[Image:LifeInApl.gif]]

In the following example, also Dyalog, the first line assigns some HTML code to a variable &quot;txt&quot; and then uses an APL expression to remove all the HTML tags, returning the text only as shown in the last line.

[[Image:StripHtmlFromText.gif]]

The following expression finds all [[prime number]]s from 1 to R. In both time and space, the calculation complexity is O(R²) (in [[Big O notation]]).

 (~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓⍳R

Executed from right to left, this means:

*ιR creates a vector containing [[integer]]s from 1 to R (if R = 6 at the beginning of the program, ιR is 1 2 3 4 5 6)
*Drop first element of this vector (↓ function), i.e. 1. So 1↓ιR is 2 3 4 5 6
*Set R to the new vector (←, assignment primitive), i.e. 2 3 4 5 6
*Generate [[outer product]] of R multiplied by R, i.e. a matrix which is the ''[[multiplication table]]'' of R by R (°.× function), i.e.

*Build a vector the same length as R with 1 in each place where the corresponding number in R is in the outer product matrix (∈, set inclusion function), i.e. 0 0 1 0 1
*Logically negate the values in the vector (change zeros to ones and ones to zeros) (∼, negation function), i.e. 1 1 0 1 0
*Select the items in R for which the corresponding element is 1 (/ function), i.e. 2 3 5
(Note, this assumes the APL origin is 1, i.e., indices start with 1. APL can be set to use 0 as the origin, which is convenient for some calculations.)

==Character set==
{{Main|APL (codepage)}}
APL has always been criticized for its choice of a unique, non-standard character set. The observation that some who learn it usually become ardent adherents shows that there is some weight behind [[Kenneth E. Iverson|Iverson]]'s idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices which could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the [[IBM]] [[Selectric]] print mechanism along with a special APL type element. Over time, with the universal use of high-quality graphic display, printing devices and [[Unicode]] support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated; however, the problem of entering APL characters requires the use of [[input method editor]]s or special keyboard mappings, which may frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages.

==Usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
APL has long had a small and fervent user base.  It was and still is popular in financial and insurance applications, in simulations, and in mathematical applications.  APL has been used in a wide variety of contexts and for many and varied purposes. A newsletter titled &quot;Quote-Quad&quot; dedicated to APL has been published since the 1970s by the SIGAPL section of the Association for Computing Machinery (Quote-Quad is the name of the APL character used for text input and output).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigapl.org/qq.htm Quote-Quad newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of full-screen systems and until as late as the mid-1980s, systems were written such that the user entered instructions in his own business specific vocabulary. APL [[time-sharing|timesharing]] vendors delivered applications in this form. On the [[I. P. Sharp Associates|I. P. Sharp]] timesharing system, a workspace called 39 MAGIC offered access to financial and airline data plus sophisticated (for the time) graphing and reporting. Another example is the GRAPHPAK workspace supplied with IBM's APL2.

Because of its matrix operations, APL was for some time quite popular for computer graphics programming, where graphic transformations could be encoded as matrix multiplications.  One of the first commercial computer graphics houses, [[Digital Effects (studio)|Digital Effects]], based in New York City, produced an APL graphics product known as &quot;Visions,&quot; which was used to create television commercials and, reportedly, animation for the 1982 film ''[[Tron (film)|Tron]]''. &lt;ref&gt;Digital Effects' use of APL was informally described at a number of SIGAPL conferences in the late 1980s; examples discussed included the early UK [[Channel 4]] TV logo/ident.  What is not clear is the extent to which APL was directly involved in the making of ''Tron'', and at this point in time the reference is more of an urban legend or historic curio than much else.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in APL has steadily declined since the mid 1980s.  This was partially due to the lack of a smooth migration path from higher performing mainframe implementations to low-cost personal computer alternatives, as APL implementations for computers before the Intel [[80386]] released in the late 1980s were only suitable for small applications.   The growth of end-user computing tools such as [[Microsoft Excel]] and [[Microsoft Access]] also eroded into potential APL usage.  These are appropriate platforms for what may have been mainframe APL applications in the 1970s and 1980s.  Some APL users migrated to the [[J programming language]], which offers more advanced features.  Lastly, the decline was also due in part to the growth of [[MATLAB]], [[GNU Octave]], and [[Scilab]].  These scientific computing array-oriented platforms provide an interactive computing experience similar to APL, but more resemble conventional programming languages such as Fortran, and use standard ASCII.

Notwithstanding this decline, APL finds continued use in certain fields, such as accounting research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/phd/fields/accounting/index.html |title=Stanford Accounting PhD requirements |publisher=Gsb.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardization==
APL has been standardized by the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[working group]] X3J10 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Joint Technical Committee 1 Subcommittee 22 Working Group 3. The Core APL language is specified in ISO 8485:1989, and the Extended APL language is specified in ISO/IEC 13751:2001.

==Glossary==
Some words used in APL literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of APL}}

APL has been used since the mid 1960s on mainframe computers and has itself evolved in step with computers and the computing market. APL is not widely used, but minimalistic and high-level by design, at several points in its history it could have captured a more significant market share, but never did. APL first appeared on large mainframe computers and, like C and Pascal, did find its way to CP/M and MS-DOS based microcomputers. Unlike C and Pascal, APL did not flourish in the microcomputer arena until hardware of sufficient computing power became commonly available. Perhaps accounting for its lack of mainstream appeal, APL's characteristics have always led to much criticism of the language. As always, such complaints may arise from misconceptions, have origins in distant APL history and no longer be relevant today, or they may have some degree of validity. This article is concerned only with the latter two categories.

'''ALGOL''' (short for '''ALGO'''rithmic '''L'''anguage)&lt;ref&gt;The name of the family is sometimes given in mixed case ([http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm ''Algol 60'']), and sometimes in all uppercase ([http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/language/other/a68rr/rrtoc.htm ''ALGOL 68'']). For simplicity this article uses ''ALGOL''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a family of [[imperative programming|imperative]] computer [[programming language]]s originally developed in the mid 1950s which greatly influenced many other languages and became the ''de facto'' way [[algorithm]]s were described in textbooks and academic works for almost the next 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Pseudocode]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with [[Fortran|FORTRAN]]&lt;!--using uppercase name because of the sentential context--&gt; and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Simula]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and many others. ALGOL introduced code blocks and the &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; pairs for delimiting them and it was also the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]]. Fragments of ALGOL-like syntax are sometimes still used as [[pseudocode]] (notations used to describe algorithms for human readers).

There were three major specifications:
* [[ALGOL 58]] - originally proposed to be called '''IAL''' (for '''I'''nternational '''A'''lgorithmic '''L'''anguage).
* [[ALGOL 60]] - first implemented as ''X1 ALGOL 60'' in mid 1960 - revised 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[ALGOL W]] on ALGOL 60 before developing [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the ALGOL 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published.

Algol 68 is substantially different from Algol 60 but was not well received, so that in general &quot;Algol&quot; means Algol 60 and dialects thereof.

==Important implementations==
The [[ALGOL 58|International Algorithmic Language]] (IAL) was extremely influential and generally considered the ancestor of most of the modern programming languages (the so-called Algol-like languages). Additionally, in [[computer science]], '''ALGOL object code''' was a simple and compact and stack-based [[instruction set|instruction set architecture]] mainly used in teaching [[compiler]] construction and other high order language (of which Algol is generally considered the first).

==History==
ALGOL was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at [[ETH Zurich]] (cf. [[ALGOL 58]]). It specified three different syntaxes: a reference syntax, a publication syntax, and an implementation syntax. The different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points (commas vs periods) for different languages.

ALGOL was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.

[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus–Naur Form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus–Naur Form]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Donald E. (1964) Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form. Communications of the ACM 7(12):735-736&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Naur: &quot;As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959. In this capacity I was the editor of the ALGOL 60 report, produced as the result of the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris in January 1960.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;naur_acm&quot;&gt;[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1024454&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=140&amp;ao=AMTURING&amp;yr=2005 ACM Award Citation / Peter Naur], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The following people attended the meeting in Paris (from January 1 to 16):
* [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], [[Peter Naur]], [[Heinz Rutishauser]], [[Klaus Samelson]], [[Bernard Vauquois]], [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], and [[Michael Woodger]] (from Europe)
* [[John Backus|John W. Backus]], [[Julien Green (computer scientist)|Julien Green]], [[Charles Katz]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Alan Perlis|Alan J. Perlis]], and [[Joseph Henry Wegstein]] (from the USA).
Alan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: &quot;The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent.&quot;

Both John Backus and Peter Naur served on the committee which created ALGOL 60 as did [[Wally Feurzeig]], who later created [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]].

ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[C. A. R. Hoare]] remarked: &quot;Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf &quot;Hints on Programming Language Design&quot;], C.A.R. Hoare, December 1973. Page 27. (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], also involved in implementing the first ALGOL 60 [[compiler]].)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language, a variant of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of ALGOL, also adopted the wording &quot;Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme&quot; for its standards documents in homage to ALGOL.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3rs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Algol and programming language research===
As [[Peter Landin]] noted, the language Algol was the first language to seamlessly combine imperative effects with the (call-by-name) [[lambda calculus]]. Perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to [[John C. Reynolds]], and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity. Reynolds's &quot;idealized&quot; Algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of &quot;local&quot; effects in the context of call-by-name languages, to be contrasted with the &quot;global&quot; effects used by call-by-value languages such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. The conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research, along with [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]] and ML.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter O'Hearn]] and [[Robert D. Tennent]]. 1996. Algol-Like Languages. Birkhauser Boston Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===IAL implementations timeline===
To date there have been at least 70 augmentations, extensions, derivations and sublanguages of Algol 60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1807 The Encyclopedia of Computer Languages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burroughs dialects included special Bootstrapping dialects such as [[ESPOL]] and [[NEWP]].

==Properties==
ALGOL 60 as officially defined had no I/O facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (ALGOL 68 parlance for Input/Output) facilities.

ALGOL 60 allowed for two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common [[call-by-value]], and [[call-by-name]]. Call-by-name had certain limitations in contrast to [[call-by-reference]], making it an undesirable feature in imperative language design. For example, it is impossible in ALGOL 60 to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.&lt;ref&gt;

Say i := 1 and A[i] := 2, so every time swap() is referenced it'll return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). Another problematic situation is passing a random() function.

However, call-by-name is still beloved of ALGOL implementors for the interesting &quot;[[Thunk (delayed computation)|thunk]]s&quot; that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the &quot;[[man or boy test]]&quot; to separate compilers that correctly implemented &quot;recursion and non-local references.&quot; This test contains an example of call-by-name.

ALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]] and which bears his name. [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s use a [[context-free grammar]] to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program; notably, they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled &quot;semantics&quot; and have to be expressed in ambiguity-prone natural language prose, and then implemented in compilers as ''ad hoc'' code attached to the formal language parser.

==Examples and portability issues==
===Code sample comparisons===
====ALGOL 60====
(The way the bold text has to be written depends on the implementation, e.g. 'INTEGER' (including the quotation marks) for '''integer'''; this is known as [[stropping (programming)|stropping]].)

 '''procedure''' Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);
     '''value''' n, m; '''array''' a; '''integer''' n, m, i, k; '''real''' y;
 '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m
 is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;
 '''begin''' '''integer''' p, q;
     y := 0; i := k := 1;
     '''for''' p:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' n '''do'''
     '''for''' q:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' m '''do'''
         '''if''' abs(a[p, q]) &gt; y '''then'''
             '''begin''' y := abs(a[p, q]);
             i := p; k := q
             '''end'''
 '''end''' Absmax

Here's an example of how to produce a table using Elliott 803 ALGOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ &quot;803 ALGOL&quot;], the manual for Elliott 803 ALGOL&lt;/ref&gt;

  FLOATING POINT ALGOL TEST'
  BEGIN REAL A,B,C,D'

  READ D'

  FOR A:= 0.0 STEP D UNTIL 6.3 DO
  BEGIN
    PRINT PUNCH(3),££L??'
    B := SIN(A)'
    C := COS(A)'
    PRINT PUNCH(3),SAMELINE,ALIGNED(1,6),A,B,C'
  END'
  END'

PUNCH(3) sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch.&lt;br&gt;
SAMELINE suppresses the carriage return + line feed normally printed between arguments.&lt;br&gt;
ALIGNED(1,6) controls the format of the output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point.

====ALGOL 68====
The following code samples are ALGOL 68 versions of the above ALGOL 60 code samples.

ALGOL 68 reuses ALGOL 60's [[stropping (programming)|stropping]]. In ALGOL 68's case tokens with the '''bold''' typeface are reserved words, types ('''mode'''s) or operators.

 '''proc''' abs max = ([,]'''real''' a, '''ref''' '''real''' y, '''ref''' '''int''' i, k)'''real''':
 '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size ⌈a by 2⌈a
 is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k; '''comment'''
 '''begin'''
    '''real''' y := 0; i := ⌊a; k := 2⌊a;
    '''for''' p '''from''' ⌊a '''to''' ⌈a '''do'''
      '''for''' q '''from''' 2⌊a '''to''' 2⌈a '''do'''
        '''if''' '''abs''' a[p, q] &gt; y '''then'''
            y := '''abs''' a[p, q];
            i := p; k := q
        '''fi'''
      '''od'''
    '''od''';
    y
 '''end''' # abs max #
Note: lower (⌊) and upper (⌈) bounds of an array, and array slicing, are directly available to the programmer.

 floating point algol68 test:
 (
   '''real''' a,b,c,d;

   printf(($pg$,&quot;Enter d:&quot;));
   read(d);

   '''for''' step '''from''' 0 '''while''' a:=step*d; a &lt;= 2*pi '''do'''
     printf($l$);
     b := sin(a);
     c := cos(a);
     printf(($z-d.6d$,a,b,c))
   '''od'''
 )
''printf'' - sends output to the '''file''' ''stand out''.&lt;br&gt;
''printf($p$);'' - selects a ''new page''.&lt;br&gt;
''printf($l$);'' - selects a ''new line''.&lt;br&gt;
''printf(($z-d.6d$,a,b,c))'' - formats output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point.

===Timeline: Hello world===
The variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic [[hello world program]].

====ALGOL 58 (IAL)====
{{main|ALGOL 58}}
ALGOL 58 had no I/O facilities.

====ALGOL 60 family====
{{main|ALGOL 60}}
Since ALGOL 60 had no I/O facilities, there is no portable [[hello world program]] in ALGOL.  The following program could (and still will) compile and run on an ALGOL implementation for a Unisys A-Series mainframe, and is a straightforward simplification of code taken from [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/index.html The Language Guide] at the [[University of Michigan]]-Dearborn Computer and Information
Science Department [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/algol/hworld.html Hello world! ALGOL Example Program page].

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   EBCDIC ARRAY E[0:11];
   REPLACE E BY &quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;;
   WRITE(F, *, E);
 END.

A simpler program using an inline format:

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   WRITE(F, &lt;&quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;&gt;);
 END.

An even simpler program using the Display statement:

 BEGIN DISPLAY(&quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;) END.

An alternative example, using Elliott Algol I/O is as follows.  Elliott Algol used different characters for &quot;open-string-quote&quot; and &quot;close-string-quote&quot;, represented here by ‘ and ’.

  '''program''' HiFolks;
  '''begin'''
     '''print''' ‘Hello world’;
  '''end''';

Here's a version for the Elliott 803 Algol (A104) The standard Elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case.  The code lacked any quote characters so £ (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote.  Special sequences were placed in double quotes (e.g. ££L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter).

   HIFOLKS'
   BEGIN
      PRINT £HELLO WORLD£L??'
   END'

The [[ICT 1900]] Algol I/O version allowed input from paper tape or punched card.  Paper tape 'full' mode allowed lower case.  Output was to a line printer.
   'BEGIN'
      'WRITE TEXT'(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;);
   'END'

====ALGOL 68====
{{main|ALGOL 68}}

'''ALGOL 68''' code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase, but bolded or underlined.
 '''begin'''
   printf(($gl$,&quot;Hello, world!&quot;))
 '''end'''
In the language of the &quot;Algol 68 Report&quot; the input/output facilities were collectively called the &quot;[[Input/output|Transput]]&quot;.

The ALGOLs were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly; also, the ALGOLs were defined so that only ''uppercase'' letters were required.

1960: [[IFIP]] - The Algol 60 language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems, but, unfortunately, were not supported on most computing systems at the time. For instance: ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, ≠, ¬, ∨, ∧, ⊂, ≡, ␣ and ⏨.

1961 September: ASCII - The [[ASCII]] character set, then in an early stage of development, had the [[\]] (Back slash) character added to it in order to support ALGOL's [[boolean data type|boolean]] operators [[/\]] and [[\/]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobbemer.com/BACSLASH.HTM How ASCII Got Its Backslash], Bob Bemer&lt;/ref&gt;

1962: [[ALCOR]] - This character set included the unusual &quot;&amp;#x16ed;&quot; &lt;!-- &quot;᛭&quot; --&gt; ([http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/16ed/index.htm iron/runic cross]) character and the &quot;⏨&quot; ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf Decimal Exponent Symbol]) for floating point notation.  &lt;!-- lower 10 has no [[unicode]] 5.1 equivalent --&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baumann | first=R. | year=1962 | title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group, Pts. 1, 2 &amp; 3 |journal=Elektronische Rechenanlagen |volume=(Oct. 1961), 206-212; No. 6 (Dec. 1961), 259-265; No. 2 (Apr. 1962)|language=German| trans_title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group| accessdate=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1964: [[GOST]] - The 1964 Russian standard [[GOST 10859]] allowed the encoding of 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit and 7-bit characters in ALGOL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOST 10859 standard|url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#gost10859|accessdate=June 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1968: The &quot;Algol 68 Report&quot; - used existing ALGOL characters, and further adopted →, ↓, ↑, □, ⌊, ⌈, ⎩, ⎧, ○, ⊥ and ¢ characters which can be found on the [[IBM 2741]] keyboard with &quot;golf-ball&quot; print heads inserted (such as the [[APL syntax and symbols|APL]] golfball), these became available in the mid 1960s while ALGOL 68 was being drafted.  The report was translated into Russian, German, French and Bulgarian, and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets, e.g. [[Cyrillic alphabet]] of the Russian [[BESM|BESM-4]]. All ALGOL's characters are also part of the [[unicode]] standard and most of them are available in several popular [[font]]s.

2009 October: [[Unicode]] - The &quot;⏨&quot; ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf Decimal Exponent Symbol]) for floating point notation was added to Unicode 5.2 &lt;!-- lower 10 has no [[unicode]] 5.1 equivalent --&gt; for backward compatibility with historic [[Buran (spacecraft)]] ALGOL software.

The '''AWK''' utility is a data extraction and reporting tool that uses a [[data-driven programming|data-driven]] [[scripting language]] consisting of a set of actions to be taken against textual data (either in files or data streams) for the purpose of producing formatted reports. The language used by awk  extensively uses the [[String (computer science)|string]] [[datatype]], [[associative array]]s (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and [[regular expression]]s.

AWK is one of the early tools to appear in [[Version 7 Unix]] and gained popularity as a way to add computational features to a Unix [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]]. A version of the AWK language is a standard feature of nearly every modern [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] available today. AWK is mentioned in the [[Single UNIX Specification]] as one of the mandatory utilities of a [[Unix]] [[operating system]]. Besides the [[Bourne shell]], AWK is the only other scripting language available in a standard Unix environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unix.org/version3/apis/cu.html The Single UNIX Specification, Version 3, Utilities Interface Table]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also present amongst the commands required by the [[Linux Standard Base]] specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/command.html#AEN32008 Linux Standard Base Core Specification 4.0, Chapter 15. Commands and Utilities]&lt;/ref&gt; Implementations of AWK exist as installed software for almost all other operating systems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

AWK was created at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1726534212;fp;4194304;fpid;1 The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK]&lt;/ref&gt; and its name is derived from the [[family name]]s of its authors — [[Alfred V. Aho|Alfred Aho]], [[Peter J. Weinberger|Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]]. The name is not commonly pronounced as a string of separate letters but rather to sound the same as the name of the bird, [[auk]] (which acts as an emblem of the language such as on [http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/ The AWK Programming Language] book cover - the book is often referred to by the abbreviation ''TAPL''). &lt;tt&gt;awk&lt;/tt&gt;, when written in all lowercase letters, refers to the [[Unix]] or [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] program that runs other programs written in the AWK programming language.

The power, terseness, and limitations of early AWK programs inspired [[Larry Wall]] to write [[Perl]] just as a new, more powerful POSIX AWK and gawk (GNU AWK) were being defined. Although AWK and [[sed]] were designed to support [[one-liner program]]s, even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs. Despite its limited intended area of use, AWK is [[Turing-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Structure of AWK programs==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;AWK is a language for processing files of text. A file is treated as a sequence of records, and by default each line is a record. Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on. An AWK program is of [sic] a sequence of pattern-action statements. AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.&quot; - Alfred V. Aho&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1726534212;pp;2 The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An AWK program is a series of pattern action pairs, written as:

 ''condition'' { ''action'' }

where ''condition'' is typically an expression and ''action'' is a series of commands.
The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each  of the conditions in turn, and executes the ''action'' for each expression that is true.
Either the ''condition'' or the ''action'' may be omitted.
The ''condition'' defaults to matching every record.
The default ''action'' is to print the record.

In addition to a simple AWK expression, such as &lt;code&gt;foo == 1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/^foo/&lt;/code&gt;, the ''condition'' can be ''BEGIN'' or ''END'' causing the ''action'' to be executed before or after all records have been read, or ''pattern1, pattern2'' which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches ''pattern1'' up to and including the record that matches ''pattern2'' before again trying to match against ''pattern1'' on future lines.

In addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator, ''~'', which matches a [[regular expression]] against a string.
As handy [[syntactic sugar]], ''/regexp/'' without using the tilde operator matches against the current record.

==AWK commands==
AWK commands are the statement that is substituted for ''action'' in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of [[dynamically linked library|dynamically linked libraries]], which can also provide more functions.

For brevity, the enclosing curly braces ( ''{ }'' ) will be omitted from these examples.

===The ''print'' command===
The ''print'' command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is:

; &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;
:This displays the contents of the current record. In AWK, records are broken down into ''fields'', and these can be displayed separately:

; &lt;tt&gt;print $1&lt;/tt&gt;
: Displays the first field of the current record

; &lt;tt&gt;print $1, $3&lt;/tt&gt;
: Displays the first and third fields of the current record, separated by a predefined string called the output field separator (OFS) whose default value is a single space character

Although these fields (''$X'') may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in [[perl]]), they actually refer to the fields of the current record.  A special case, ''$0'', refers to the entire record.  In fact, the commands &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print $0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; are identical in functionality.

The ''print'' command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:

 print 3+2
 print foobar(3)
 print foobar(variable)
 print sin(3-2)

Output may be sent to a file:

 print &quot;expression&quot; &gt; &quot;file name&quot;

or through a [[pipe (Unix)|pipe]]:

 print &quot;expression&quot; | &quot;command&quot;

===Built-in variables===
Awk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record.

Other variables include:

*NR: Keeps a current count of the number of input records.
*NF: Keeps a count of the number of fields in an input record. The last field in the input record can be designated by $NF.
*FILENAME: Contains the name of the current input-file.
*FS: Contains the &quot;field separator&quot; character used to divide fields on the input record. The default, &quot;white space&quot;, includes any space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character to change the field separator.
*RS: Stores the current &quot;record separator&quot; character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a &quot;newline&quot;.
*OFS: Stores the &quot;output field separator&quot;, which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a &quot;space&quot; character.
*ORS: Stores the &quot;output record separator&quot;, which separates the output records when Awk prints them. The default is a &quot;newline&quot; character.
*OFMT: Stores the format for numeric output. The default format is &quot;%.6g&quot;.

===Variables and syntax===
Variable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators ''+ - * /'' represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string [[concatenation]], simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names cannot be placed adjacent to each other without having a space in between. String constants are [[delimited]] by double quotes. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using ''#'' as the first character on a line.

===User-defined functions===
In a format similar to [[C (programming language)|C]], function definitions consist of the keyword &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt;, the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example of a function.

 function add_three (number) {
   return number + 3
 }

This statement can be invoked as follows:

 print add_three(36)     # Outputs '''39'''

Functions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] in the argument list before the local variables, in order to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin.

One or more space may exist between the function name and the open parenthesis in the function definition, but no space at all is allowed in the function call.

==Sample applications==
===Hello World===
Here is the customary &quot;[[Hello world]]&quot; program written in AWK:

 BEGIN { print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }

Note that an explicit &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN&lt;/tt&gt;, no command-line arguments are processed.

===Print lines longer than 80 characters===
Print all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line.

 length($0) &gt; 80

===Print a count of words===
Count words in the input, and print the number of lines, words, and characters (like [[wc (Unix)|wc]])

 {
     w += NF
     c += length + 1
 }
 END { print NR, w, c }

As there is no pattern for the first line of the program, every line of input matches by default so the increment actions are executed for every line. Note that &lt;tt&gt;w += NF&lt;/tt&gt; is shorthand for &lt;tt&gt;w = w + NF&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Sum last word===

 { s += $NF }
 END { print s + 0 }

''s'' is incremented by the numeric value of ''$NF'' which is the last word on the line as defined by AWK's field separator, by default white-space. ''NF'' is the number of fields in the current line, e.g. 4. Since ''$4'' is the value of the fourth field, ''$NF'' is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has, or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines. $ is actually a unary operator with the highest [[operator precedence]]. (If the line has no fields then ''NF'' is 0, ''$0'' is the whole line, which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space, and so has the numeric value 0.)

At the end of the input the ''END'' pattern matches so ''s'' is printed. However, since there may have been no lines of input at all, in which case no value has ever been assigned to ''s'', it will by default be an empty string. Adding zero to a variable is an AWK idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value. (Concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string, e.g. ''s &quot;&quot;''.  Note, there's no operator to concatenate strings, they're just placed adjacently.) With the coercion the program prints ''0'' on an empty input, without it an empty line is printed.

===Match a range of input lines===

 $ yes Wikipedia | awk 'NR % 4 == 1, NR % 4 == 3 { printf &quot;%6d  %s\n&quot;, NR, $0 }' | sed 7q
      1  Wikipedia
      2  Wikipedia
      3  Wikipedia
      5  Wikipedia
      6  Wikipedia
      7  Wikipedia
      9  Wikipedia
 $

The [[yes (Unix)|yes]] command repeatedly prints its argument (by default the letter &quot;y&quot;) on a line. In this case, we tell the command to print the word &quot;Wikipedia&quot;. The action statement prints each line numbered. The printf function emulates the standard C [[printf]], and works similarly to the print command described above. The pattern to match, however, works as follows: ''NR'' is the number of records, typically lines of input, AWK has so far read, i.e. the current line number, starting at 1 for the first line of input. ''%'' is the [[modulo operation|modulo]] operator. ''NR % 4 == 1'' is true for the first, fifth, ninth, etc., lines of input. Likewise, ''NR % 4 == 3'' is true for the third, seventh, eleventh, etc., lines of input. The range pattern is false until the first part matches, on line 1, and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches, on line 3. It then stays false until the first part matches again on line 5. The [[sed]] command is used to print the first 7 lines, to prevent &lt;tt&gt;yes&lt;/tt&gt; running forever. It is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;head -n7&lt;/tt&gt; if the [[head (Unix)|head]] command is available.

The first part of a range pattern being constantly true, e.g. ''1'', can be used to start the range at the beginning of input. Similarly, if the second part is constantly false, e.g. ''0'', the range continues until the end of input:
 /^--cut here--$/, 0
prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression ''^--cut here--$'', that is, a line containing only the phrase &quot;--cut here--&quot;, to the end.

===Calculate word frequencies===
Word frequency uses [[associative array]]s:

 BEGIN {
     FS=&quot;[^a-zA-Z]+&quot;
 }
 {
      for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++)
           words[tolower($i)]++
 }
 END {
     for (i in words)
          print i, words[i]
 }

The BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. Note that separators can be regular expressions. After that, we get to a bare action, which performs the action on every input line. In this case, for every field on the line, we add one to the number of times that word, first converted to lowercase, appears. Finally, in the END block, we print the words with their frequencies. The line
 for (i in words)
creates a loop that goes through the array words, setting i to each ''subscript'' of the array. This is different from most languages, where such a loop goes through each value in the array. The loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count. &lt;tt&gt;tolower&lt;/tt&gt; was an addition to the One True awk (see below) made after the book was published.

===Match pattern from command line===
This program can be represented in several ways. The first one uses the [[Bourne shell]] to make a shell script that does everything. It is the shortest of these methods:

 $ cat grepinawk
 pattern=$1
 shift
 awk '/'$pattern'/ { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }' $*
 $

The &lt;tt&gt;$pattern&lt;/tt&gt; in the awk command is not protected by quotes.  A pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line (&lt;tt&gt;$0&lt;/tt&gt;) matches. &lt;tt&gt;FILENAME&lt;/tt&gt; contains the current filename. awk has no explicit concatenation operator; two adjacent strings concatenate them. &lt;tt&gt;$0&lt;/tt&gt; expands to the original unchanged input line.

There are alternate ways of writing this. This shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk:

 $ cat grepinawk
 pattern=$1
 shift
 awk '$0 ~ ENVIRON[&quot;pattern&quot;] { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }' $*
 $

This is a shell script that uses &lt;tt&gt;ENVIRON&lt;/tt&gt;, an array introduced in a newer version of the One True awk after the book was published. The subscript of &lt;tt&gt;ENVIRON&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of an environment variable; its result is the variable's value. This is like the [[getenv]] function in various standard libraries and [[POSIX]]. The shell script makes an environment variable &lt;tt&gt;pattern&lt;/tt&gt; containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file.

&lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand; &lt;tt&gt;!~&lt;/tt&gt; is its inverse. Note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables.

The next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable:

 $ cat grepinawk
 pattern=$1
 shift
 awk '$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }' &quot;pattern=$pattern&quot; $*
 $

Finally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy:

 BEGIN {
     pattern = ARGV[1]
     for (i = 1; i &lt; ARGC; i++) # remove first argument
         ARGV[i] = ARGV[i + 1]
     ARGC—if (ARGC == 1) { # the pattern was the only thing, so force read from standard input (used by book)
         ARGC = 2
         ARGV[1] = &quot;-&quot;
     }
 }
 $0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }

The &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN&lt;/tt&gt; is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN&lt;/tt&gt; block ends. &lt;tt&gt;ARGC&lt;/tt&gt;, the number of arguments, is always guaranteed to be ≥1, as &lt;tt&gt;ARGV[0]&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the command that executed the script, most often the string &lt;tt&gt;&quot;awk&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Also note that &lt;tt&gt;ARGV[ARGC]&lt;/tt&gt; is the empty string, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line.

Note the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; block. awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command. This means that
 awk 'prog'
only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before &lt;tt&gt;prog&lt;/tt&gt; is run! If you explicitly set &lt;tt&gt;ARGC&lt;/tt&gt; to 1 so that there are no arguments, awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files. Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Self-contained AWK scripts==
As with many other programming languages, self-contained AWK script can be constructed using the so-called &quot;[[shebang (Unix)|shebang]]&quot; syntax.

For example, a UNIX command called &lt;tt&gt;hello.awk&lt;/tt&gt; that prints the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; may be built by creating a file named &lt;tt&gt;hello.awk&lt;/tt&gt; containing the following lines:

 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN { print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }

The &lt;tt&gt;-f&lt;/tt&gt; tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from, which is placed there by the shell when running.

== Versions and implementations==
AWK was originally written in 1977, and distributed with [[Version 7 Unix]].

In 1985 its authors started expanding the language, most significantly by adding user-defined functions. The language is described in the book ''The AWK Programming Language'', published 1988, and its implementation was made available in releases of [[UNIX System V]]. To avoid confusion with the incompatible older version, this version was sometimes known as &quot;new awk&quot; or ''nawk''. This implementation was released under a [[free software license]] in 1996, and is still maintained by Brian Kernighan. (see external links below)

Old versions of Unix, such as [[UNIX/32V]], included &lt;tt&gt;awkcc&lt;/tt&gt;, which converted AWK to C. Kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into C++; its state is not known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awkc++.ps An AWK to C++ Translator]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''BWK awk''' refers to the version by [[Brian Kernighan|Brian W. Kernighan]], also known as ''nawk''. It has been dubbed the &quot;One True AWK&quot; because of the use of the term in association with the book that originally described the language and the fact that Kernighan was one of the original authors of AWK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/ '''The AWK Programming Language''', ISBN 0-201-07981-X.]&lt;/ref&gt; FreeBSD refers to this version as ''one-true-awk''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/contrib/one-true-awk/FREEBSD-upgrade?rev=1.9&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup FreeBSD's work log for importing BWK awk into FreeBSD's core], dated 2005-05-16, downloaded 2006-09-20&lt;/ref&gt; This version also has features not in the book, such as &lt;tt&gt;tolower&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ENVIRON&lt;/tt&gt; that are explained above; see the FIXES file in the source archive for details. This version is used by e.g. [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]] or [[MacOS X]].
*'''gawk''' ([[GNU]] awk) is another free software implementation and the only implementation that made serious attempts at implementing [[Internationalization and localization]] and TCP/IP networking. It also allows the user to extend the functionality of the program via user-written shared libraries. It was written before the original implementation became freely available, and is still widely used. Many [[Linux distribution]]s come with a recent version of ''gawk'' and it is widely recognized as the ''de facto'' standard implementation in the [[Linux]] world. ''gawk'' version 3.0 was included as ''awk'' in [[FreeBSD]] prior to version 5.0. Subsequent versions of FreeBSD use ''BWK awk'' in order to avoid the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/bsdl-gpl/ FreeBSD's view of ''GPL Advantages and Disadvantages'']&lt;/ref&gt; a [[BSD and GPL licensing|more restrictive]] license than the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.0R/relnotes-i386.html#USERLAND FreeBSD 5.0 release notes] with notice of '''BWK awk''' in the base distribution&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Yggdrasil]]]]

In [[Norse religion]], '''Asgard''' ([[Old Norse]]: '''Ásgarðr'''; meaning &quot;Enclosure of the [[Æsir]]&quot;&lt;ref name=LINDOW&gt;[[John Lindow|Lindow, John]]. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs]'' (2001) Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. ISBN 0-19-515382-0.&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]] and is the country or capital city of the [[Æsir|Norse Gods]] surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a [[Hrimthurs]] riding the [[stallion]] [[Svadilfari]], according to ''[[Gylfaginning]]''. [[Valhalla]] is located within Asgard. [[Odin]] and his wife, [[Frigg]], are the rulers of Asgard.

==Attestations==
[[Image:Manuscript Gylfi.jpg|thumb|right|In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', [[Gylfi]], King of Sweden before the arrival of the [[Æsir]] under [[Odin]], travels to Asgard, questions the three officials shown in the illumination concerning the Æsir, and is beguiled. Note that the officials have one eye, a sign of Odin. One of his attributes is that he can make the false seem true. 18th century Icelandic manuscript.]]
The primary sources regarding Asgard come from the [[Prose Edda]], written in the 13th century by [[Iceland]]ic [[Snorri Sturluson]], and the [[Poetic Edda]], compiled in the 13th century from a basis of much older [[Skald|Skaldic poetry]].

===''Poetic Edda''===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
''[[Völuspá]]'', the first poem of the work, mentions many of the features and characters of Asgard portrayed by Snorri, such as [[Yggdrasil]] and [[Iðavöllr]].

===''Prose Edda''===
The [[Prose Edda]] presents two views regarding Asgard.

====''Prologue''====
In the ''Prologue'' Snorri offers an [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] and Christian-influenced interpretation of the myths and tales of his forefathers. As-gard, he conjectures, is the home of the Æsir (singular Ás) in As-ia, making a [[folk etymology|folk etymological]] connection between the three &quot;As-&quot;; that is, the Æsir were &quot;men of Asia&quot;, not gods, who moved from Asia to the north and some of which intermarried with the peoples already there. Snorri's interpretation of the 13th century foreshadows 20th century views of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] migration from the east.

Snorri further writes that Asgard is a land more fertile than any other, blessed also with a great abundance of gold and jewels. Correspondingly, the Æsir excelled beyond all other people in strength, beauty and talent.

Snorri proposes the location of Asgard as [[Troy]], the center of the earth. About it were 12 kingdoms and 12 chiefs. One of them, Múnón, married [[Priam]]'s daughter, Tróán, and had by her a son, Trór, to be pronounced [[Thor]] in [[Old Norse]]. The latter was raised in [[Thrace]]. At age 12 he was whiter than ivory, had hair lighter than gold, and could lift 10 bear skins at once. He explored far and wide. His son, Odin, led a migration to the northern lands, where they took wives and had many children, populating the entire north with Aesir. One of the sons of Odin was [[Yngvi]], founder of the [[Ynglingar]], an early royal family of [[Sweden]].

=

====''Skáldskaparmál''====
The 10th century Skald [[Þorbjörn dísarskáld]] is quoted in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' as stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;Thor has defended Asgard and [[List of names of Odin|Ygg's]] [Odin's] people [the gods] with strength.&quot;''&lt;ref name=LINDOW/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Heimskringla''===
====''Ynglinga Saga''====
By the time of the ''[[Ynglinga Saga]]'', Snorri had developed his concept of Asgard further, although the differences might be accounted for by his sources. In the initial stanzas of the poem Asagarth is the capital of Asaland, a section of Asia to the east of the Tana-kvísl or Vana-Kvísl river (kvísl is &quot;fork&quot;), which Snorri explains is the [[Tanais]], or [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], flowing into the [[Black Sea]]. The river divides &quot;Sweden the Great&quot;, a concession to the [[Viking]] point of view. It is never called that prior to the Vikings (Section 1).

The river lands are occupied by the [[Vanir]] and are called Vanaland or Vanaheim. It is unclear what people Snorri thinks the Vanes are, whether the proto-[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Venedi]] or the east Germanic [[Vandals]], who had been in that region at that time for well over 1000 years. He does not say; however, the Germanic names of the characters, such as Njord, Frey and Vanlandi, indicate he had the Vandals in mind.

Odin is the chief of Asagarth. From there he conducts and dispatches military expeditions to all parts of the world. He has the virtue of never losing a battle (Section 2). When he is away, his two brothers, [[Vili and Vé]], rule Asaland from Asagarth.

On the border of Sweden is a mountain range running from northeast to southwest. South of it are the lands of the Turks, where Odin had possessions; thus, the mountains must be the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. On the north are the unihabitable fells, which must be the tundra/taiga country. Apparently the Vikings did not encounter the [[Urals]] or the [[Uralic]]s of the region. Snorri evidences no knowledge of them.

There also is no mention of [[Troy]], which was not far from [[Constantinople]], capital of the [[Byzantine empire]] and militarily beyond the reach of the Vikings. Troy cannot have been Asagarth, Snorri realizes, the reason being that the Æsir in Asaland were unsettled by the military activities of the Romans; that is, of the Byzantine Empire.

As a result, Odin led a section of the Æsir to the north looking for new lands in which to settle. They used the Viking route up the Don and the [[Volga]] through [[Garðaríki]], Viking [[Russia]]. From there they went to Saxland (Germany) and to the lands of [[Gylfi]] in [[Scandinavia]] (Section 5). The historical view, of course, is mainly fantastical. The Germanics were in Germany and Scandinavia during earliest mention of them in Roman literature, long before the Romans had even conquered Italy. To what extent Snorri's presentation is poetic creation only remains unclear.

Demoted from his position as all-father, or king of the gods, Odin becomes a great sorcerer in the Ynglinga Saga. He can shape-shift, speaks only in verse, and lies so well that everything he says seems true. He strikes enemies blind and deaf but when his own men fight they go  berserk and cannot be harmed. He has a ship that can be rolled up like a tablecloth when not used, he relies on two talking ravens to gather intelligence, and he consults the talking head of a dwarf for prophecy (he carries it around long since detached from its body) (Section 7).

As a man, however, Odin is faced with the necessity to die. He is cremated and his possessions are burned with him so that he can ascend to - where? If Asgard is an earthly place, not there. Snorri says at first it is Valhalla and then adds: &quot;The Swedes now believed that he had gone to the old Asagarth and would live there forever&quot; (Section 9). Finally Snorri resorts to Heaven, even though nothing in Christianity advocates cremation and certainly the burning of possessions avails the Christian nothing.

==Etymology==
According to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', ''Asgard'' is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''āss'', god + ''gardhr'', enclosure; from [[Indo European language|Indo-European]] roots ''ansu-'' spirit, demon (see cognate [[Ahura Mazda|ahura]]) + ''gher-'' grasp, enclose (see cognates [[garden]] and [[Yard (land)|yard]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asgard |work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. |year=2000 |publisher=New York:Houghton Mifflin Company}}; See also '''ansu-''' and '''gher-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''' in &quot;Appendix I: Indo-European Roots&quot; in the same work.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other spellings==
* Alternatives Anglicisations: Ásgard, Ásegard, Ásgardr, Asgardr, Ásgarthr, Ásgarth, Asgarth, Esageard, Ásgardhr, Asgaard
* Common [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] form: Asgård

The '''Apollo program''' was the [[United States]] [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] effort which landed the [[Moonwalkers|first humans]] on Earth's [[Moon]]. Conceived during the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] and conducted by the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), Apollo began in earnest after President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1961 address to Congress declaring his belief in a national goal of &quot;landing a man on the Moon&quot; by the end of the decade&lt;ref name=&quot;Special Message&quot;&gt;[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy, John F]].[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx &quot;Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs&quot;]. jfklibrary.org, May 25, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox, pp. 16-17&quot;&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Space Race|competition with the Soviet Union]] for supremacy in space.

[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|left|Buzz Aldrin during Apollo 11's first Moon landing mission in 1969]]

This goal was first accomplished during the [[Apollo 11]] mission on July 20, 1969 when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]]. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six Apollo spaceflights, 12 men walked on the Moon. These are the only times humans have landed on another [[celestial body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11, Manned Apollo Missions]. NASA, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo program ran from 1961 until 1975, and was America's third orbital [[human spaceflight]] program (following [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]). It used [[Apollo spacecraft]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launch vehicles, which were also used for the [[Skylab|Skylab program]] in 1973&amp;ndash;74, and a joint [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|U.S.&amp;ndash;Soviet mission]] in 1975. These subsequent programs are thus often considered part of the Apollo program.

The program was successfully carried out despite two major setbacks: the 1967 [[Apollo 1]] launch pad fire that killed three astronauts; and an oxygen tank rupture during the 1970 [[Apollo 13]] flight which disabled the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]]. Using the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Excursion Module]] as a &quot;lifeboat&quot;, the three crewmen narrowly escaped with their lives, thanks to their skills and the efforts of flight controllers, project engineers, and backup crew members.

Apollo set [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957-1969|major milestones]] in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]; [[Apollo 8]] was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while [[Apollo 17]] marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond [[low Earth orbit]].  The program spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including [[avionics]], [[telecommunications]], and [[computers]].  Apollo also sparked interest in many fields of [[engineering]] and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks.  Its command modules and other objects and artifacts are displayed throughout the world, notably in the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums]] in Washington, DC and at NASA's centers in Florida, Texas and Alabama. The Apollo 13 Command Module is housed at the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center]] in Hutchinson, Kansas. 

==Background==
{{Main|Space Race}}

The Apollo program was conceived early in 1960, during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration, as a follow-up to America's Mercury program. While the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission, the Apollo spacecraft was to be able to carry three astronauts on a circumlunar flight and eventually to a lunar landing. The program was named after the [[Apollo|Greek god of light and music]] by NASA manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said that &quot;I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; While NASA went ahead with planning for Apollo, funding for the program was far from certain given Eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of space exploration and missile defense. Using space exploration as a symbol of national prestige, he warned of a &quot;[[missile gap]]&quot; between the two nations, pledging to make the U.S. not &quot;first but, first and, first if, but first period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, 'Kennedy and the Decision to Go to the Moon,' in Launius and McCurdy, eds., ''Spaceflight and the Myth of Presidential Leadership''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing.&lt;ref&gt;Sidey, ''John F. Kennedy'', pp. 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt; When Kennedy's newly-appointed NASA Administrator [[James Edwin Webb|James Webb]] requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, 'Kennedy and the Decision to Go to the Moon', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|left|May 25, 1961: President John Kennedy addresses Congress on his plan to put a man on the Moon within nine years.]]

On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Discussion of Soviet Man-in-Space Shot,&quot; Hearing before the Committee on Science and Astronautics, U.S. House of Representatives, 87th Congress, First Session, April 13, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy, however, was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Sidey, ''John F. Kennedy'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], asking Johnson to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy to Johnson, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo1.pdf &quot;Memorandum for Vice President,&quot;] April 20, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that &quot;we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lbjmemo&quot;&gt;Johnson to Kennedy, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf &quot;Evaluation of Space Program,&quot;] April 28, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first.&lt;ref name=&quot;lbjmemo&quot;/&gt;

[[File:John F. Kennedy speaks at Rice University.jpg|thumb|right|upright|President Kennedy delivers a speech at [[Rice University]] on the American space program, September 12, 1962.]]

On May 25, 1961, Kennedy announced his support for the Apollo program during a special address to a joint session of Congress:
{{quote|I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.|John F. Kennedy&lt;ref name=&quot;Special Message&quot;/&gt;}}

At the time of Kennedy's speech, only one American had flown in space&amp;mdash;less than a month earlier&amp;mdash;and NASA had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox, pp. 16-17&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sietzen|first=Frank|title=Soviets Planned to Accept JFK’s Joint Lunar Mission Offer|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/russia-97h.html|work=&quot;SpaceCast News Service&quot; Washington DC |accessdate=October 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Landing men on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity, and the largest commitment of resources ($24 billion), ever made by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the Apollo program employed 400,000 people and required the support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Apollo.html NASA Langley Research Center's Contributions to the Apollo Program]. NASA Langley Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kennedy repeated his challenge in a more famous speech at Rice University more than a year later in September, 1962, by which time two Americans had already orbited the Earth in the [[Mercury program]]. In the speech, Kennedy said:

[[File:President Kennedy speech on the space effort at Rice University, September 12, 1962.ogg|thumb|left|thumbtime=17:32|right|President Kennedy speaks at Rice University, September 12, 1962 (17 mins 47 secs).]]
{{quote|We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too ... 

Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, &quot;Because it is there.&quot; Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the Moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.|John F. Kennedy|Speech at Rice University&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice Speech&quot;&gt;[[John F.

==Choosing a mission mode==
{{See also|Moon landing}}

Once Kennedy had defined a goal, the Apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a set of flights that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life, cost, and demands on technology and astronaut skill. Four possible mission modes were considered:

[[File:Apollo Direct Ascent.png|thumb|left|Early Apollo configuration for Direct Ascent and Earth Orbit Rendezvous (1961)]]

* '''[[Direct Ascent]]:''' A spacecraft would travel directly to the Moon, landing and returning as a unit. This plan would have required a more powerful booster, the planned [[Nova (rocket)|Nova rocket]].
* '''[[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR):''' Multiple rockets (up to 15 in some claims) would be launched, each carrying various parts of a Direct Ascent spacecraft and propulsion units that would have enabled the spacecraft to escape earth orbit. After a docking in earth orbit, the spacecraft would have landed on the Moon as a unit.
* '''Lunar Surface Rendezvous:''' Two spacecraft would be launched in succession. The first, an automated vehicle carrying propellants, would land on the Moon and would be followed some time later by the manned vehicle. Propellant would be transferred from the automated vehicle to the manned vehicle before the manned vehicle could return to Earth.
* '''[[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR):''' One [[Saturn V]] would launch a spacecraft that was composed of modular parts. A [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]] would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar excursion module]] would descend to the Moon and then return to dock with the command ship while still in lunar orbit. In contrast with the other plans, LOR required only a small part of the spacecraft to land on the Moon, thereby minimizing the mass to be launched from the Moon's surface for the return trip.

In early 1961, direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA. Many engineers feared that a rendezvous —let alone a docking— neither of which had been attempted even in [[Earth orbit]], would be extremely difficult in [[lunar orbit]]. However, dissenters including [[John Houbolt]] at [[Langley Research Center]] emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator [[Robert Seamans]]; while acknowledging that he spoke &quot;somewhat as a voice in the wilderness,&quot; Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Grimwood and Swenson, ''Chariots for Apollo'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamans' establishment of the Golovin committee in July 1961 represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen21&quot;&gt;Hansen, ''Enchanted Rendezvous'', p 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the ad-hoc committee was intended to provide a recommendation on the boosters to be used in the Apollo program, it recognized that the mode decision was an important part of this question. The committee recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode, but its consideration of LOR —as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work— played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of NASA's [[Space Task Group]] at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] in Houston began to come around to support for LOR.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen21&quot;/&gt; The engineers at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by [[Wernher von Braun]] at a briefing in June 1962. NASA's formal decision in favor of LOR was announced on July 11, 1962. Space historian James Hansen concludes that:
{{quote|
Without NASA's adoption of this stubbornly held minority opinion in 1962, the United States may still have reached the Moon, but almost certainly it would not have been accomplished by the end of the 1960s, President Kennedy's target date.|James Hansen|Enchanted Rendezvous&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Enchanted Rendezvous'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a &quot;life boat&quot; in the event of a failure of the command ship. This happened on [[Apollo 13]] when an oxygen tank failure left the command ship without electrical power.  The Lunar Module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely.

Preliminary design studies of Apollo spacecraft began in 1960 as a three-man command module supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized for use in various possible missions, such as: shuttle service to a [[space station]], a [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]], or return to Earth from a lunar landing. Once the Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of the '''Command/Service Module''' (CSM), in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip. (An even larger, separate propulsion module would have been required for the lunar descent.) 

The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to a translunar ferry used to take the crew and a new spacecraft, the '''Lunar Module''' (LM), which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.

As the program concept evolved, use of the term &quot;module&quot; changed from its true meaning of an interchangeable component of systems with multiple variants, to simply a component of the complete lunar landing system.

===Command/Service Module===
{{Main|Apollo Command/Service Module}}
[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 15 CSM in lunar orbit]]

The [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) was the crew cabin, surrounded by a conical re-entry heat shield, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean splashdown. As such, it was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Equipment carried by the Command Module included [[Reaction control system|reaction control engines]], a docking tunnel, guidance and navigation systems and the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]].

Attached to the Command Module was the cylindrical [[Apollo service module|Service Module]] (SM), which housed the service propulsion engine and its propellants, the fuel cell power system, four maneuvering thruster quads, a high-gain [[S-band]] antenna for communications between the Moon and Earth, and storage tanks for water and oxygen.  On the last three lunar missions, it also carried a scientific instrument package. Because its configuration was chosen early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.

As used in the actual lunar program, the two modules remained attached throughout most of the flight to make a single ferry craft, somewhat awkwardly known as the Command/Service Module (CSM) which carried a separate lunar lander (only half as heavy as the CSM) to the Moon, and the astronauts home to Earth. Just before re-entry, the Service Module was discarded and only the Command Module re-entered the atmosphere, using its heat shield to survive the intense heat caused by air friction. After re-entry it deployed parachutes that slowed its descent, allowing a smooth splashdown in the ocean.

Under the leadership of [[Harrison Storms]], [[North American Aviation]] won the contract to build the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Relations between North American and NASA were strained during the winter of 1965-66 by delivery delays, quality shortfalls, and cost overruns in both components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cause was determined to be an electrical short in the wiring of the Command Module; while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex, the review board concluded that &quot;deficiencies existed in Command Module design, workmanship and quality control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html Report of the Apollo 204 Review Board, Findings and Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the removal of Storms as Command Module program manager.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mike. &quot;Angle of Attack: Harrison Storms and the Race to the Moon&quot;, Penguin Books (Non-Classics) (June 1, 1994).

===Lunar Module===
{{Main|Apollo Lunar Module}}
[[File:Apollo16LM.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 16 LM on the lunar surface]]

The [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module (LM)]] (originally known as the Lunar Excursion Module, or LEM), was designed to fly between lunar orbit and the surface, landing two astronauts on the Moon and taking them back to the Command Module. It had no aerodynamic [[heat shield#Space|heat shield]] and was of a construction so lightweight that it would not have been able to fly through the Earth's atmosphere. It consisted of two stages, a descent and an ascent stage. The descent stage contained compartments which carried cargo such as the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package]] and [[Lunar Rover]].

The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]], and the project was overseen by [[Tom Kelly (engineer)|Tom Kelly]]. There were also problems with the Lunar Module; due to delays in the test program, the LM became a &quot;pacing item,&quot; meaning that it was in danger of delaying the schedule of the whole Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch7-4.html Chariots for Apollo, Ch 7-4]&lt;/ref&gt; The first manned LM was not ready for its planned Earth orbit test in December 1968, but the program was kept on schedule by cancelling a second manned Earth orbit LM flight.

==Launch vehicles==
When the team of engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]] began planning for the Apollo program, it was not yet clear what mission their rockets would have to support. Direct ascent would require a more powerful launch vehicle, the planned [[Nova (rocket)|Nova]], which could carry a very large payload to the Moon. NASA's decision in favor of Lunar Orbit Rendezvous re-oriented the work of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] towards the development of the [[Saturn I]], [[Saturn IB]] and [[Saturn V]]. While the Saturn V was less powerful than the Nova would have been, it was still much more powerful than any rocket developed before, or since.  (The USSR [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] was approximately as powerful, but it was never successful.)

===Saturn IB===
{{Main|Saturn IB}}
[[File:Apollo 7 launch.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saturn IB]] rocket launches [[Apollo 7]] into Earth orbit, October 11, 1968.]]

The [[Saturn IB]] was an upgraded version of the earlier [[Saturn I]] rocket, which was used in early Apollo [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] launches. It consisted of:
*An [[S-IB]] first stage powered by eight [[H-1 (rocket engine)|H-1]] engines burning [[RP-1]] with [[LOX]] oxidizer, to produce {{convert|1600000|lbf|kN|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} of thrust;
*An [[S-IVB|S-IVB-200]] second stage, powered by one [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine burning [[liquid hydrogen]] with [[LOX]] oxidizer, to produce {{convert|225000|lbf|kN|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=on}} of thrust; and
*An [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] which contained the rocket's guidance system.

The Saturn IB was capable of putting a partially-fueled Command/Service Module, or a Lunar Module, into earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Saturn IB News Reference: Saturn IB Design Features&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in five of the Apollo test missions including the first manned mission.  It was also used in the manned missions for the Skylab program and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

===Saturn V===
{{Main|Saturn V}}
[[File:Ksc-69pc-442.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Saturn V]] [[Saturn (rocket family)|rocket]] launches Apollo 11 in 1969]]

The Saturn V was a three-stage rocket consisting of:
*An [[S-IC]] first stage, powered by five [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines arranged in a cross pattern, burning [[RP-1]] with [[LOX]] oxidizer to produce {{convert|7500000|lbf|kN|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of thrust. They burned for 2.5 minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to a speed of approximately 6,000 miles per hour (2.68&amp;nbsp;km/s).&lt;ref&gt;Saturn V News Reference: First Stage Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;
*An [[S-II]] second stage, powered by five of the J-2 engines used in the S-IVB. They burned for approximately six minutes, taking the spacecraft to a speed of 15,300 miles per hour (6.84&amp;nbsp;km/s) and an altitude of about &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;115&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(185&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Saturn V News Reference: Second Stage Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;
*An [[S-IVB|S-IVB-500]] third stage similar to the Saturn IB's second stage, with capability to restart the J-2 engine.  The engine would burn for approximately two and a half minutes and shut down when a low-Earth parking orbit was achieved. After approximately two orbits to confirm the spacecraft was ready to commit to the lunar trip, the engine was restarted to make the [[Trans lunar injection|translunar injection]] maneuver taking the spacecraft into an extremely high orbit where it would be captured by the Moon's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Saturn V News Reference: Third Stage Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;
*An instrument unit with a guidance system similar to that used on the Saturn IB.

Three Saturn V vehicles launched on Earth orbital flights. Two of the three ([[Apollo 4]] and [[Apollo 6|6]]) were unmanned tests of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command and service modules]], and the third was a manned flight, [[Apollo 9]], testing the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]].  Nine Saturn Vs launched manned Apollo missions to the Moon, including [[Apollo 11]].  It was also used for the unmanned launch of Skylab.

==Astronauts==
The following [[astronaut]]s flew on the 11 manned Apollo missions, plus the [[Apollo 1]] crew who were killed in a ground test one month before they were to have flown the first manned mission. Not included are the astronauts who subsequently flew on the [[Skylab]] ([[Apollo Applications Program]]) or [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] missions which used the Apollo CSM.

===Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)===
Mission rules specified that, in most circumstances, only one person in the [[Mission Control Center]] would communicate directly with the in-flight crew, and that this was to be another astronaut, who would be best able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and communicate with the crew in the clearest way.  These individuals were designated ''Capsule Communicators'' or CAPCOMs, a term carried over from the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] programs. They were usually chosen from the backup and support crews, and worked in shifts during long missions.

The periodic ''beeps'' heard during communications with the astronauts are known as [[Quindar tones]].

==Missions==
{{See also|List of Apollo missions}}

===Mission types===

see [[List of Apollo mission types]]

===Unmanned missions===
Apollo required more than six years of spacecraft and launch vehicle development and testing before the first manned missions could be flown. Test flights of the [[Saturn I]] launch vehicle began in October 1961 and lasted until September 1964. Three further Saturn I launches carried [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] models of the Apollo command/service module. Two [[pad abort test]]s of the [[launch escape system]] took place in 1963 and 1965 at the [[White Sands Missile Range]]. Three unmanned tests of Apollo components with the [[Saturn IB]] (Apollo-Saturn, or '''AS''') were officially designated [[AS-201]], [[AS-202]], and [[AS-203]].

The only unmanned missions to be publicly designated as &quot;Apollo&quot; followed by a sequence number were Apollo 4, Apollo 5 and Apollo 6.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The simple numbering was started at &quot;4&quot; to follow the three Apollo-Saturn IB flights, though all subsequent flights kept the &quot;AS&quot; designations: AS-204 and following for Saturn IB flights, and AS-501 and following for Saturn V flights.

[[Apollo 4]] was the first unmanned test flight of the Saturn V launch vehicle, carrying a Command/Service Module (CSM). Launched on November 9, 1967, Apollo 4 exemplified [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]]'s strategy of &quot;all up&quot; testing. Rather than being tested stage by stage, as most rockets were, the Saturn V would be flown for the first time as one unit. [[Walter Cronkite]] covered the launch from a broadcast booth about 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) from the launch site. The extreme noise and [[vibrations]] from the launch nearly shook the broadcast booth apart- ceiling tiles fell and windows shook. At one point, Cronkite was forced to dampen the booth's plate glass window to prevent it from shattering.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; This launch showed that additional protective measures were necessary to protect structures in the immediate vicinity. Future launches used a damping mechanism directly at the launchpad which proved effective in limiting the generated noise. The mission was a highly successful one, demonstrating the capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar return reentry by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth-orbital reentry speed.

[[Apollo 5]] was the first unmanned test flight of the Lunar Module (LM) in Earth orbit, launched on January 22, 1968, by a Saturn IB. The critical LM engines were successfully tested (though a computer programming error cut one test firing short), including an in-flight test of the second stage engine in &quot;abort mode,&quot; in which the ascent engine is fired simultaneously with the jettison of the descent stage. This capability was made available, only to be used in the event of a critical problem on the Moon landing, such as running out of descent fuel, but was never needed.

[[Apollo 6]] was the last unmanned Saturn V flight, launched on April 4, 1968. It carried a CSM and a Lunar Module Test Article near the mass of the Lunar Module for ballast. It was planned to achieve [[translunar injection]], then after 5 minutes, use the Service Module engine to return the CM to Earth, thus demonstrating the Saturn V's ability to send the Apollo craft to the Moon, and a direct return-to-Earth abort capability. However, [[pogo oscillation|&quot;pogo&quot; vibration]]s caused premature shutdown of two second-stage engines, and failure of the third stage to re-light for the translunar injection. Instead, the Service Module engine was used as in Apollo 4 to raise the craft to a higher Earth orbit, and bring the CM back at a velocity midway between that of low Earth orbit and lunar return velocity. This mission was considered successful enough to launch men on the next Saturn V flight, since fixes for the vibration problem were identified.

===Manned missions===

The manned missions carried three astronauts, designated as Commander, Command Module Pilot (CMP), and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Besides exercising all crew command decisions, the Commander was the primary pilot of both spacecraft (when present) and was first to exit the LM on the surface of the Moon. The CMP functioned as navigator, usually performed the initial docking with the LM, and remained in the Command/Service Module when his companions flew the LM. The LMP functioned as engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft. On a landing mission, he accompanied the Commander on the lunar surface. On the last flight, the LMP was a professional geologist, Dr. [[Harrison Schmitt]].

[[Apollo 7]], launched on October 11, 1968, was the first manned mission in the program. It was an 11-day Earth-orbital flight intended to test the Command Module, redesigned following the Apollo 1 fire.  It was the first manned launch of the Saturn IB launch vehicle and the first three-man American space mission.

[[File:Apollo 15 Lunar Rover and Irwin.jpg|thumb|left|Jim Irwin near a Lunar Roving Vehicle used on Apollos 15&amp;ndash;17]]

Between December 21, 1968 and May 18, 1969, NASA planned to launch three manned test / practice missions using the Saturn V launch vehicle and the complete spacecraft including the LM. But by the summer of 1968 it became clear to program managers that a fully functional LM would not be available for the Apollo 8 launch. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, they chose to send the crew planned to make the second orbital LM test in Apollo 9, to orbit the Moon in the CSM on [[Apollo 8]] during Christmas. The original idea for this switch was the brainchild of [[George Low]], Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office. Although it has often been claimed that this change was made as a direct response to Soviet attempts to fly a piloted [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft around the Moon, there is no evidence that this was the case. NASA officials were aware of the Soviet Zond flights, but the timing of the Zond missions does not correspond well with the extensive written record from NASA about the Apollo 8 decision. The Apollo 8 decision was primarily based upon the LM schedule, not fear of the Soviets beating the Americans to the Moon.

[[File:Apollo17 plaque.jpg|thumb|right|On the final Apollo mission, the [[Apollo 17]] crew left this plaque as on all landings.]]

This was followed by the first orbital manned LM flight on [[Apollo 9]] (with the original Apollo 8 crew), and the lunar &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; [[Apollo 10]] which took the LM to within {{convert|50000|ft|km|sigfig=2}} of the surface, but did not land.

{{Bquote|That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.| | |[[Neil Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Neil Armstrong#First_Moon_walk]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The next two flights (11 and 12) included successful Moon landings. The [[Apollo 13]] mission was aborted before the landing attempt, but the crew returned safely to Earth. The four subsequent Apollo missions (14 through 17) included successful Moon landings. The last three of these were J-class missions that included the use of [[Lunar Rover]]s.

[[Apollo 17]], launched December 7, 1972, was the last Apollo mission to the Moon. Mission commander [[Eugene Cernan]] was the last person to leave the Moon's surface. The crew returned safely to Earth on December 19, 1972.

The Apollo program returned 841.5&amp;nbsp;lb (381.7&amp;nbsp;kg) of [[Moon rocks|rocks and other material from the Moon]], much of which is stored at the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] in Houston. The only sources of Moon rocks on Earth are those collected from the Apollo program, the former Soviet Union's [[Luna programme|Luna missions]], and [[lunar meteorites]].

The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by [[radiometric dating]] techniques. They range in age from about 3.2 billion years old for the [[basalt]]ic samples derived from the [[lunar mare]], to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the [[Lunar highlands|highlands]] crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = James Papike, Grahm Ryder, and Charles Shearer | title = Lunar Samples | journal = Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 5.1–5.234 | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the [[Solar System]] that is largely missing from Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program was the [[Genesis Rock]], retrieved by astronauts [[James Irwin]] and [[David Scott]] during the Apollo 15 mission. This rock, called [[anorthosite]], is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral [[anorthite]], and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called [[KREEP]] was discovered that has no known terrestrial counterpart. Together, KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see [[lunar magma ocean]]).

Almost all the rocks show evidence for having been affected by impact processes. For instance, many samples appear to be pitted with [[micrometeoroid]] impact craters, something which is never seen on earth due to its thick atmosphere. Additionally, many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt, referring to materials that are melted near an impact crater. Finally, all samples returned from the Moon are highly [[breccia]]ted as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events.

Analysis of composition of the lunar samples support the [[giant impact hypothesis]], that the Moon was created through a &quot;giant impact&quot; of a large astronomical body with the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

==Program costs and cancellation==
When President Kennedy first chartered the Moon landing program, a preliminary cost estimate of $7 billion was generated, but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely, and James Webb used his administrator's judgement to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson.&lt;ref name=Butts&gt;

Webb's estimate shocked many at the time, but ultimately proved to be reasonably accurate.
The final cost of project Apollo was reported to Congress as $25.4 billion in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;House, Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, 1974 NASA Authorization, Hearings on H.R. 4567, 93/2, Part 2, Page 1271.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, NASA held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion. This included all [[research and development]] costs; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets, 16 Command/Service Modules, 12 Lunar Modules, plus program support and management costs; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading, and costs for flight operations. This was based on a [[Congressional Budget Office]] report, ''A Budgetary Analysis of NASA’s New Vision for Space'', September 2004.&lt;ref name=Butts/&gt;

===Canceled missions===
{{Main|Canceled Apollo missions}}

Originally three additional lunar landing missions had been planned, as ''Apollo 18'' through ''Apollo 20''. In light of the drastically shrinking [[NASA]] budget and the decision not to produce a second batch of Saturn Vs, these missions were canceled to make funds available for the development of the [[Space Shuttle]], and to make their Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launch vehicles available to the Skylab program. Only one of the remaining Saturn Vs was actually used to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory in 1973; the others became museum exhibits at the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island]], [[Florida]], [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

==Apollo Applications Program==
{{Main|Apollo Applications Program}}

Following the success of the Apollo program, both NASA and its major contractors investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series, later called the [[Apollo Applications Program]], proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit. Many of these would use the space that the lunar module took up in the Saturn rocket to carry scientific equipment. Of all the plans, only two were implemented: the [[Skylab]] space station and the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]]. 

Skylab's fuselage was constructed from the [[S-IVB|second stage]] of a Saturn IB, and the station was equipped with the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], itself based on a lunar module. The station's three crews were ferried into orbit atop Saturn IBs, riding in CSMs; the station itself had been launched with a modified Saturn V. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979, by which time it had become the oldest operational Apollo-Saturn component.

The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project involved a docking in Earth orbit between a CSM and a Soviet [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft from July 15 to July 24, 1975. NASA's next manned mission would not be until [[STS-1]] in 1981.

In 2008, [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]]'s [[SELENE]] probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the Apollo 15 lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2008/05/20080520_kaguya_e.html |title=The &quot;halo&quot; area around Apollo 15 landing site observed by Terrain Camera on SELENE(KAGUYA)|date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |publisher=[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, NASA's [[robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]], while orbiting {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=2}} above the moon, photographed the remnants of the Apollo program left on the lunar surface, and photographed each site where manned Apollo flights landed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html |title=LRO Sees Apollo Landing Sites |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/revisited/index.html |title=Apollo Landing Sites Revisited |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 16, 2009 editorial, ''The New York Times'' opined that:
{{cquote|[T]here’s something terribly wistful about these photographs of the Apollo landing sites. The detail is such that if Neil Armstrong were walking there now, we could make him out, make out his footsteps even, like the astronaut footpath clearly visible in the photos of the Apollo 14 site. Perhaps the wistfulness is caused by the sense of simple grandeur in those Apollo missions. Perhaps, too, it’s a reminder of the risk we all felt after the Eagle had landed — the possibility that it might be unable to lift off again and the astronauts would be stranded on the Moon. But it may also be that a photograph like this one is as close as we’re able to come to looking directly back into the human past.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt_lro_lm_img&quot;/&gt;}}

Proposed future lunar landing missions, such as the [[Google Lunar X Prize]], intend to record close-up images of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]s and [[List of artificial objects on the Moon|other artificial objects on the surface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/about-the-prize/rules-and-guidelines|title=Rules &amp; Guidelines|publisher=[[X PRIZE Foundation]]|date=2008-11-20|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Science and engineering===
{{further|[[NASA spin-off|NASA spinoff technologies]]}}

The Apollo program, specifically the [[lunar landing]]s, has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/introduction.htm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11], NASA, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/07/99/the_Moon_landing/396037.stm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11]. BBC, 23 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The program stimulated many areas of technology. The [[Apollo Guidance Computer|flight computer]] design used in both the lunar and command modules was, along with the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman Missile System]], the driving force behind early research into [[integrated circuit]]s. The [[fuel cell]] developed for this program was the first practical fuel cell. Computer-controlled machining ([[Numerical control|CNC]]) was pioneered in fabricating Apollo structural components.

===Cultural impact===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|150px|left|&quot;Everything that I ever knew - my life, my loved ones, the Navy - everything, the whole world was behind my thumb.&quot; –[[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] ]]
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|160px|right|&quot;We went to explore the Moon, and in fact discovered the Earth.&quot; –[[Eugene Cernan]] ]]

The crew of Apollo 8, the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon, sent televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth (left), and read from the creation story in the Biblical book of Genesis, on [[Christmas Eve]], 1968, This was believed to be the most widely watched television broadcast until that time. The mission and Christmas provided an inspiring end to [[1968]], which had been a bad year for the U.S., marked by [[Vietnam War]] protests, race riots, and the assassinations of civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King]] and Senator [[Robert Kennedy]].

An estimated one-fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the first [[Apollo 11|Apollo]] moonwalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burrows |first=William E. |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library | page=429 |isbn=0375754857 |oclc=42136309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One legacy of the Apollo program is the now-common view of Earth as a fragile, small planet, captured in photographs taken by the astronauts during the lunar missions. The most famous, taken by the [[Apollo 17]] astronauts, is [[The Blue Marble]] (right). These photographs have also motivated some people toward [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Al Gore]]|url=http://forumpolitics.com/blogs/2007/03/17/an-inconvient-truth-transcript/|title=An Inconvenient Truth Transcript|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=''Politics Blog'' - a reproduction of the film's transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many astronauts and [[astronaut#Russia|cosmonauts]] have commented on the profound effects that seeing Earth from space has had on them;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} the [[List of Apollo astronauts|24 astronauts who traveled to the Moon]] are the only humans to have observed Earth from beyond [[low Earth orbit]], and have traveled farther from Earth than anyone else to date.

==Apollo 11 broadcast data restoration project==

As part of Apollo 11's 40th anniversary in 2009, NASA spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/40th/&lt;/ref&gt;  After an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the Apollo 11 moonwalk, NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased.&lt;ref name=NPR_tapes&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106637066 &quot;Houston, We Erased The Apollo 11 Tapes&quot;]. National Public Radio, July 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We're all saddened that they're not there. We all wish we had 20-20 hindsight.  I don't think anyone in the NASA organization did anything wrong, I think it slipped through the cracks, and nobody's happy about it.|Dick Nafzger, TV Specialist, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;ref name=NPR_tapes/&gt;}}

The Moon landing data was recorded by a special [[Apollo TV camera]] which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV.  This resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes.  During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to be recorded over with newer satellite data.  Stan Lebar, who designed and built the lunar camera at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.&lt;ref name=NPR_tapes/&gt;

{{quote|So I don't believe that the tapes exist today at all.  It was a hard thing to accept. But there was just an overwhelming amount of evidence that led us to believe that they just don't exist anymore. And you have to accept reality.|Stan Lebar, Lunar Camera Designer, Westinghouse Electric Corporation&lt;ref name=NPR_tapes/&gt;}}

With a budget of $230,000, the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to [[Lowry Digital]] for restoration.  The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moon footage restore&quot;&gt;Borenstein, Seth for AP. [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090716/ap_on_sc/us_sci_Moon_video &quot;NASA lost Moon footage, but Hollywood restores it&quot;]. Yahoo news, July 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and [[kinescope]] recordings made at Johnson Space Center.  The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moon footage restore&quot;/&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
In [[law]], '''assault''' is a [[crime]] of [[violence]] against another [[human|person]]. The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but can refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of force.&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Code, Title 5, Chapter 13, Subchapter 2, § 205-207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code, Part 1, Chapter 9, § 240&lt;/ref&gt; Assault in some jurisdictions is defined more broadly still as any intentional physical contact with another person without their consent;&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1993 supplements and 1994 and 1996 editions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 9th Ed, p.402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Smith [1991] Crim LR 900&lt;/ref&gt; but in some [[common law]] jurisdictions, this is defined instead as [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Some jurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the definition of the crime making it a criminal assault to intentionally cause another person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact.

== Definition ==
=== Battery ===
In common law, criminal assault was an attempted battery. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act&lt;ref&gt;An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) done for the purpose of causing an harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.&lt;ref&gt;A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person and is an assault if the rock misses. The fact that the person may have been unaware that the rock had been thrown at him is irrelevant under this definition of assault.

===Aggravated assault===
[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2004: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/aggravated_assault.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person:
* attempts to cause [[Grievous bodily harm|serious bodily injury]] to another person such as in the case of kidnapping
* attempts to have sexual activity with another person under the age of 14
* attempts or causes bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon.

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of harm against police officers or other public servants, or for bodily harm stemming from the reckless operation of a [[motor vehicle]].  The latter is often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''

==Defences==
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

===Consent===
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

[[consent (criminal)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;(RvG ref 6. 1980): see [http://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75]&lt;/ref&gt; This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include; surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[Mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (R v Wilson), or horseplay (Jones and others). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish Law, consent is not a defense for assault.

===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes &quot;reasonable&quot; varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of less severe corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s58 [[Children Act 2004]], limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

===Defense of property===
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that he felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.

== Regional details ==
===Canada===
Assault is an offence under s. 55 of the [[Criminal Code of Canada]]. Similar to the United States, there are many different ways in which an assault can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to “tap”, “pinch”, “push”, or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault. The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. Some variations on the ordinary felony of assault include:

* Assault: The offence is created by section 266 of the Code.
* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.
* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]].
* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.
* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.
* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.
* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.
* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].

===India===
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in s.351 through s.358.
{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - &quot;Indian Penal Code&quot;|accessdate=02 Mar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Code further explains that &quot;''mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault.''&quot; Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

===Nigeria===
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2029 Criminal Code Act-PartV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with &quot;intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her&quot; or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2025 Criminal Code Act-PartV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Islands===

'''Marshall Islands'''

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ Criminal Code [31 MIRC Ch 1&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A person is guilty of this offence if he unlawfully offers or attempts, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

===Republic of Ireland===
Section 2 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997]] creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

===United Kingdom===
Assault on an officer of Revenue and Customs: This offence is created by section 32(1) of the [[Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005]].

Attacks on internationally protected persons: Section 1(1)(a) of the [[Internationally Protected Persons Act 1978]] (c.17) makes provision for assault occasioning actual bodily harm or causing injury on &quot;protected persons&quot; (including Heads of State). 

Attacks on UN Staff workers: Section 1(2)(a) of the [[United Nations Personnel Act 1997]] (c.13) makes provision for assault causing injury, and section 1(2)(b) makes provision for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, on UN staff.

Abolished offence:

Assault on customs and excise officers, etc.: Section 16(1)(a) of the [[Customs and Excise Management Act 1979]] (c.2) provided that it was an offence to, amongst other things, assault any person duly engaged in the performance of any duty or the exercise of any power imposed or conferred on him by or under any enactment relating to an assigned matter, or any person acting in his aid. For the meaning of &quot;assault&quot; in this provision, see Logdon v. DPP [1976] Crim LR 121, [[Divisional court|DC]]. This offence was abolished and replaced by the [[Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005]].

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}

English law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms &quot;assault&quot; and &quot;common assault&quot; often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

In ''[[R v. Ireland]]'',&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that causing a person to apprehend violence can be committed by way of action or words. ''Words'' can also mean that otherwise threatening actions are rendered not capable of being an assault, as in the case of ''[[Tuberville v. Savage]]''.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;(1669) 1 Mod 3, T.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the plaintiff told the defendant (while putting his hand on his sword) that he would ''not'' stab him, because the circuit judge was visiting town for the local assizes. On that basis, the defendant was deemed to have known that he was not about to be injured, and it was held that no assault had been committed by the plaintiff (which would otherwise have justified the defendant's allegedly pre-emptive strike).

The &quot;immediacy&quot; required by statute has been the subject of some debate.  The leading case, again, is ''R v. Ireland''. Therein, the House of Lords held that the making of silent telephone calls could amount to an assault if it caused the victim to believe that physical violence might be used against him in the immediate future. One example of &quot;immediacy&quot; adopted by the House in that case was that a man who said, &quot;I will be at your door in a minute or two,&quot; might (in the circumstances where those words amounted to a threat) be guilty of an assault.

A [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[magistrates court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.

=====Aggravated assaults=====

;Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: The offence of [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]] is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].

;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]]. If an assault is prosecuted as being racially or religiously aggravated, then it is triable [[either way]] and the maximum penalty in this case is up to two years' imprisonment, or a fine, or both.

;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].

;Assault with intent to resist arrest: This offence is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. The offender may intend to resist either his own or someone else's arrest. This offence is also triable either way, and punishable by up to two years' imprisonment.

;Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:
::a [[constable]] acting in the execution of their duty; or
::a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

It is a [[summary offence]] which carries a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. The &quot;starting sentence,&quot; however, is a short custodial sentence, and it is considered a more serious offence than common assault.

The constable must be acting &quot;in the execution of his duty&quot; for this offence to be made out.  If he exceeds the remit of his duty (e.g. acts unlawfully in assaulting the Defendant), the offence will not be made out.

:The Defendant does not actually have to be aware that the person he is assaulting is a constable (''Forbes'' (1865) 10 Cox CC 362).

The fact that the victim is a police officer is not, in itself, an aggravating factor which would justify more serious charge. The criteria for a charge under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 do not distinguish between members of the public and police officers as the victim.

:According to ''R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court'' (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable cannot be acting in the execution of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if the officer is not acting under the authority of a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for the officer to remain. Should the officer refuse to leave, the officer will cease to be &quot;acting in the execution of their duty&quot;. To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at the officer which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, the officer must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause the officer to leave.

However, motive may aggravate when the purpose of the assault is an intent to resist or prevent lawful arrest. Under section 38 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, this is a hybrid offence, which carries a maximum penalty on indictment of two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. This offence may also be used for assaults on store detectives or members of the public exercising a right to apprehend or detain an alleged offender committing an arrestable offence.

;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).

;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).

;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an &quot;attack upon the person of another&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155&lt;/ref&gt; There is distinction made in Scotland between assault and batter, although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''&lt;ref&gt;1987 SCCR 534&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:

{{cquote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesaken'' (to assault a person in his own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply &quot;evil intent&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been held to mean no more than that assault ''&quot;cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently&quot;'' as upheld in ''Lord Advocate's Reference No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a &quot;hold-up&quot; in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of his duty, under section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

====Northern Ireland====
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:
* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;
* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43
* Common assault: under section 47
* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47
The [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:
* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.

That act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under secction 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

===United States===
American [[common law]] has defined assault as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]].

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]] (unless it involves a [[Police|law enforcement]] officer).  The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at common law:
# The apparent, present ability to carry out;
# An unlawful attempt;
# To commit a violent injury;
# Upon another.

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Modern American statutes define assault as:
# an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another; or,
# [[negligent]]ly causing bodily injury to another with a [[deadly weapon]].

Some states also define assault as an attempt to menace (or actual menacing) by placing another person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an &quot;attempted assault&quot; since it can be considered a double [[inchoate offense]].

In some states, [[consent (criminal)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault are human.  Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man.  However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances.  See  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c108:5:./temp/~c1082ah2oE::  H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212]{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
*A defendant could argue that since he was drunk, he could not form the [[intention (criminal)|specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
*A defendant could also argue that he was engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

===Ancient Greece===
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]].  Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, &quot;hubris&quot; referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1976) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, &quot;outrageous treatment&quot;, in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an &quot;act of hubris&quot;, or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[Atë]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of his/her hubris, or great pride, that leads to his/her death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of &quot;insolence, contempt, and excessive violence&quot;.

[[File:Ängsälvor - Nils Blommér 1850.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Meadow Elves'', by [[Nils Blommér]], 1850]]

'''Alfheim''' ({{Lang-non|Ālfheimr}}, &quot;elf home&quot;) is one of the [[Nine Worlds]] and home of the [[Álfar|Light Elves]] in [[Norse mythology]] and appears also in Scottish ballads under the form '''Elfhame''' (''Elphame'', ''Elfame'') as a [[fairyland]], sometimes modernized as '''Elfland''' (''Elfinland'', ''Elvenland'').

==In Old Norse texts==
Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in [[Old Norse]] texts.

The [[eddic poem]] ''[[Grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&amp;nbsp;5 with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Ýdalir]] call they &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the place where [[Ullr|Ull]]&lt;br/&gt;
A hall for himself hath set;&lt;br/&gt;
And Álfheim the gods &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; to [[Freyr|Frey]] once gave&lt;br/&gt;
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.

In the 12th century eddic prose ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' [[Snorri Sturluson]] relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called [[Light elves]] [''Ljósálfar'']; but the [[Dark elf|Dark-elves]] [''dökkálfar''] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The account later, in speaking of a hall called [[Gimlé]] and the southernmost end of heaven that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[Vídbláin]] [''Vídbláinn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (''Vindbláinn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&amp;nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[Völuspá]]''.

==In English and Scots texts==
In several [[Scots language|Scots]] and in Northern [[Middle English]] folkoric [[ballad]]s, Álfheim was known in as ''Elphame'' or ''Elfhame''. In later English publications it has been called Alfheim, ''Elfland'' or '''Elfenland''.  The fairy queen is often called the &quot;[[Queen of Elphame]]&quot; in ballads such as that of [[Thomas the Rhymer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'I'm not the Queen of Heaven, Thomas,&lt;br/&gt;
That name does not belong to me;&lt;br/&gt;
I am but the Queen of fair Elphame&lt;br/&gt;
Come out to hunt in my follie.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Cleevescove7.JPG|right|thumb|180px|One of the entrances to the [[Cleeves Cove cave]] system; the 'Elf Hame' of the Bessie Dunlop story.]]
[[Allison Peirson]] was [[death by burning|burned]] as a [[witch]] in 1588 for conversing with the 'Queen of Elfame' and for prescribing magic charms and potions.  (Byre Hills, [[Fife, Scotland]])

On 8 November 1576, midwife [[Bessie Dunlop]], resident in [[Dalry, North Ayrshire|Dalry]], Scotland, was accused of sorcery and witchcraft. She answered her accusers that she received tuition from Thomas Reid, a former barony officer who had died at the Battle of Pinkie some 30 years before and also from the Queen of the Elfhame which lay nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Alexander (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh : W &amp; R Chambers. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in a conviction and she was burnt at the stake&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Alexander (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh : W &amp; R Chambers. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1576.

Elfhame or Elfland, is portrayed in a variety of ways in these ballads and stories, most commonly as mystical and benevolent, but also at times as sinister and wicked. The mysteriousness of the land, and its otherworldly powers are a source of scepticism and distrust in many tales. Examples of journeys to the realm include &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; and the fairy tale &quot;[[Childe Rowland]]&quot;, the latter being a particularly negative view of the land.

==Use by J. R. R. Tolkien==
The 20th-century fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] anglicized ''Álfheim'' as ''Elvenhome'', or ''[[Aman#Eldamar|Eldamar]]'' in the [[Quenya|speech of the Elves]].  In his stories, Eldamar lies in a coastal region of the [[Undying Lands]] in the Uttermost West. The High King of the Elves in the West was [[Ingwë]], an echo of the name [[Yngvi]] often found as a name for Frey, whose abode was in ''Álfheim'' according to the ''Grímnismál''.

[[Image:Odin, Lodur, Hoenir skabe Ask og Embla by Frølich.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|&quot;Hœnir, Lóðurr and Odin create Askr and Embla&quot; (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ask and Embla''' (from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''Askr ok Embla'')—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both sources, [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|three]] gods, one of whom is [[Odin]], find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Ask and Embla by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Ask and Embla (1919) by Robert Engels.]]
[[Old Norse]] ''askr'' literally means &quot;[[fraxinus excelsior|ash tree]]&quot; but the [[etymology]] of ''embla'' is uncertain, and two possibilities of  the meaning of ''embla'' are generally proposed. The first meaning, &quot;[[Ulmus glabra|elm tree]]&quot;, is problematic, and is reached by deriving ''*Elm-la'' from ''*Almilōn'' and subsequently to ''almr'' (&quot;elm&quot;).&lt;ref name=SIMEK74&gt;Simek (2007:74).&lt;/ref&gt; The second suggestion is &quot;[[vine]]&quot;, which is reached through ''*Ambilō'', which may be related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''ámpelos'', itself meaning &quot;vine, [[liana]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=SIMEK74&gt;Simek (2007:74).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories.

According to [[Benjamin Thorpe]] &quot;[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]] says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assiduous labour; the same relation as [[Mashya and Mashyana|Meshia and Meshiane]], the [[Iranian religion|ancient Persian]] names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees.&quot;&lt;ref name=THORPE337&gt;Thorpe (1907:337).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==
In stanza 17 of the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', the [[völva]] reciting the poem describes that [[Hœnir]], [[Lóðurr]] and [[Odin]] once found Ask and Embla on land. The völva says that the two were capable of very little, lacking in ''[[wyrd|ørlög]]'' and describes that they were given three gifts by the three gods:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;Old Norse:&lt;/small&gt;
:Ǫnd þau né átto, óð þau né hǫfðo,
:lá né læti né lito góða.
:Ǫnd gaf Óðinn, óð gaf Hœnir,
:lá gaf Lóðurr ok lito góða.&lt;ref name=DRONKE11&gt;Dronke (1997:11).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Spirit they possessed not, sense they had not,
:blood nor motive powers, nor goodly colour.
:Spirit gave Odin, sense gave Hœnir,
:blood gave Lodur, and goodly colour.&lt;ref name=THORPE5&gt;Thorpe (1866:5).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Soul they had not, sense they had not,
:Heat nor motion, nor goodly hue;
:Soul gave Othin, sense gave Hönir,
:Heat gave Lothur and goodly hue.&lt;ref name=BELLOWS8&gt;Bellows (1936:8).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An amount of scholarly disagreement has occurred over the meaning of these gifts and translations therefore vary.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCHACH93&quot;&gt;Schach (1985:93).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to chapter 9 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the three brothers [[Vili and Vé|Vili, Vé]], and Odin, are the creators of the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of [[Midgard]].&lt;ref name=BYOCK18&gt;Byock (2006:18).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
[[Image:Sölvesborg Ask och Embla2.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;Ask och Embla&quot; (1948) by Stig Blomberg. In [[Sölvesborg]], Sweden. Photo by Henrik Sendelbach.]]
A [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of ''embla'' meaning &quot;vine.&quot; In Indo-European societies, an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and [[sexual intercourse]]. Vines were used as a flammable wood, where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood, resulting in fire. Further evidence of ritual making of fire in [[Scandinavia]] has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a [[The King's Grave|Bronze Age grave in Kivik]], [[Scania]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=SIMEK74/&gt;

A preceding stanza to the account of the creation of Ask and Embla in ''Völuspá'' provides a catalog of [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]], and stanza 10 has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth. This may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans, and that the three gods gave them life.&lt;ref name=LINDOW62-63&gt;Lindow (2001:62—63).&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyne Larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in Old Norse works (examples include &quot;trees of jewellery&quot; for women and &quot;trees of battle&quot; for men) due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees; Ask and Embla.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON279&gt;Larrington (1999:279).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two wooden figures of &quot;more than human height&quot; were unearthed from a [[peat bog]] at [[Braak]] in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], [[Germany]]. The figures depict a nude male and a nude female. [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] comments that these figures may represent a &quot;Lord and Lady&quot; of the [[Vanir]], a group of Norse gods, and that &quot;another memory of [these wooden deities] may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAVIDSON-88-89&quot;&gt;Davidson (1975:88—89).&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure named [[Oisc of Kent|Æsc]] ([[Old English language|Old English]] &quot;ash tree&quot;) appears as the son of [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengest]] in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] genealogy for the kings of [[Kent]]. This has resulted in an amount of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre-Norse [[Germanic mythology]].&lt;ref name=ORCHARD8&gt;Orchard (1997:8).&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections have been proposed between Ask and Embla and the [[Vandals|Vandal]] kings Assi and Ambri, attested in [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 7th century AD work ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]''. There, the two ask the god [[Wōdanaz|Godan]] (Odin) for victory. The name ''Ambri'', like Embla, likely derives from ''*Ambilō''.&lt;ref name=SIMEK74/&gt;

==Modern influence==
Ask and Embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions. A sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern Swedish city of [[Sölvesborg]], created in 1948 by Stig Blomberg. Ask and Embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the [[Oslo City Hall]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] by [[Dagfin Werenskjold]].&lt;ref name=OSLOKOMMUNE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oslo.kommune.no/losartikler/article23199-7726.html?articleID=23199&amp;categoryID=7726&amp;tip=1 |title=Yggdrasilfrisen |author=Municipality of Oslo |date=2001-06-26 |accessdate=2008-09-08 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] artist [[Anker Eli Petersen]] included a depiction of the couple in his series of Faroe Islands stamps.

The '''Alabama River''', in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alabama]], is formed by the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and [[Coosa River|Coosa]] rivers, which unite about {{convert|6|mi|0}} north of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].&lt;ref name = eb&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/11995/Alabama-River&lt;/ref&gt;  

The river flows west to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], then southwest until, about {{convert|45|mi}} from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], it unites with the [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]], forming the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and [[Tensaw River|Tensaw]] rivers, which discharge into [[Mobile Bay]].&lt;ref name = eb/&gt; 

The course of the Alabama is very meandering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caria.org/navigation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its width varies from {{convert|50|to|200|yd}}, and its depth from {{convert|3|to|40|ft|0}}. Its length as measured by the [[United States Geological Survey]] is {{convert|318.5|mi}},&lt;ref name=NHD&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and by steamboat measurement, {{convert|420|mi}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  

The river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state, and [[railway]]s connect it with the [[mineral]] regions of north central Alabama.  

[[Image:Alabama River.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The Alabama River at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in 2004]]

After the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the [[Cahaba River]], which is about {{convert|194|mi}} long&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; and joins the Alabama River about {{convert|10|mi}} below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from [[Rome, Georgia]], to about {{convert|117|mi}} above [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]] (about {{convert|102|mi}} below Rome and {{convert|26|mi}} below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government.  

The navigation of the Tallapoosa River –- which has its source in [[Paulding County, Georgia]], and is about {{convert|265|mi}} long&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; -– is prevented by [[shoal]]s and a {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} fall at [[Tallassee, Alabama|Tallassee]], a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.

The river played an important role in the growth of the [[economy]] in the region during the 19th century as a source of [[transportation]] of goods. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.

The Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] before their [[Indian Removal|removal]] in the early 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alain de Lille''' (or '''Alanus ab Insulis''') (c. 1128–1202), French [[theology|theologian]] and poet, was born, probably in [[Lille]], some years before 1128. 

==Life==

Little is known of his life.  He seems to have taught in the schools of Paris, and he attended the [[Third Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] in 1179.  He afterwards inhabited [[Montpellier]] (he is sometimes called '''Alanus de Montepessulano'''), lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister, and finally retired to [[Cîteaux]], where he died in 1202.  

He had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge, more varied than profound, caused him to be called ''Doctor universalis''. Among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the [[Latin literature]] of the Middle Ages; one of these, the ''De planctu naturae'', is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity.  He created the allegory of grammatical &quot;conjugation&quot; which was to have its successors throughout the Middle Ages.  The ''Anticlaudianus'', a treatise on morals as [[Medieval allegory|allegory]], the form of which recalls the pamphlet of Claudian against Rufinus, is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity.

==Theologian==

As a theologian Alain de Lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against the [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]].  His [[mysticism]], however, is far from being as absolute as that of the [[Victorines]].  In the ''Anticlaudianus'' he sums up as follows: Reason, guided by prudence, can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order; for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith.  This rule is completed in his treatise, ''Ars catholicae fidei'', as follows: Theology itself may be demonstrated by reason.  Alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle, and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the [[Creed]].  This bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal, and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection ([[axiom]], [[theorem]], [[corollary]], etc.) that gives his treatise its apparent originality.

==Works and attributions==

Alain de Lille has often been confounded with other persons named Alain, in particular with another Alanus ([[Alain, bishop of Auxerre]]), Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury, Alain de Podio, etc.  Certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him, as well as some of their works: thus the ''Life of St Bernard'' should be ascribed to Alain of Auxerre and the ''Commentary upon Merlin'' to [[Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury|Alan of Tewkesbury]].  Alan of Lille was not the author of a ''Memoriale rerum difficilium'', published under his name, nor of ''[[Moralium dogma philosophorum]]'', nor of the satirical ''[[Apocalypse of Golias]]'' once attributed to him; and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the ''Dicta Alani de lapide philosophico'' really issued from his pen.  On the other hand, it now seems practically demonstrated that Alain de Lille was the author of the ''Ars catholicae fidei'' and the treatise ''Contra haereticos''.

In his sermons on capital sins, Alain argued that [[sodomy]] and homicide are the most serious sins, since they call forth the wrath of God, which led to the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. His chief work on penance, the ''Liber poenitenitalis'' dedicated to [[Henry de Sully]], exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. Alain's identification of the sins against nature included [[bestiality]], [[masturbation]], oral and anal intercourse, [[incest]], [[adultery]] and [[rape]]. In addition to his battle against moral decay, Alan wrote a work against [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and Christian heretics dedicated to William VIII of [[Montpellier]].

[[Image:Alemanni expansion.png|thumb|320px|Area settled by the Alamanni, and sites of Roman-Alamannic battles, 3rd to 6th century]]

The '''Alamanni''', '''Allemanni''', or '''Alemanni''' were originally an alliance of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s located around the upper [[Rhine]] river ([[Germany]]). One of the earliest references to them is the [[cognomen]] ''Alamannicus'' assumed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who ruled the [[Roman Empire]] from 211–217 and claimed thereby to be their conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Jacob Hofmann, ''Lexicon Universale'', Leiden 1698, &quot;Alamannicus&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this alliance and their previous [[Germanic tribes|tribal affiliations]] remain uncertain.  The alliance was aggressive in nature, attacking the Roman province of [[Germania Superior]] whenever it could{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Generally its strategy with respect to the Empire was similar to that of the [[Franks]].

From the 1st century, the Rhine had become the border between Roman [[Gaul]] and tribal Germania. Germanic peoples, [[Celts]], and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands along both banks.  The Romans divided these territories into two districts, ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and ''[[Germania Superior]]'' situated along the lower (north) and upper (south) [[Rhine]] respectively.

Upper Germania included the region between the upper Rhine and the upper [[Danube]], (the [[Black Forest]] region that was larger than today: see [[Hercynian Forest]]).  The Romans called this the ''[[Agri Decumates]]'', (i.e. &quot;Decumates territories&quot;), a name of unknown origin. Some scholars have translated the expression as &quot;the ten cantons&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Roman ''decem'', &quot;ten&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; but whose cantons of what entity is not known.

The exterior Roman fortified border around the area of Germania Superior was called the ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''. The assembled warbands of the Alamanni frequently crossed the ''limes'', attacking Germania Superior and moving into the Agri Decumates. As a confederation, from the 5th century, they settled the [[Alsace]] and expanded into the [[Swiss Plateau]], as well as parts of what are now [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]], reaching the valleys of the [[Alps]] by the 8th century.

According to ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' the confederates in the 3rd century were still simply called ''Germani''. [[Proculus]], an imperial usurper in 280,  derived some of his popularity in Gaul by his battle successes against the Alamanni.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;He was, nevertheless, of some benefit to the Gauls, for he crushed the Alamanni—who then were still called Germans—and not without illustrious glory, though he never fought save in brigand-fashion&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alamanni, thereafter became the nation of [[Alamannia]], that was sometimes independent, but more often was ruled by the [[Franks]]. The name of Germany and the German language, in [[French language|French]], ''Allemagne, allemand'',  in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Alemanha, alemão'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Alemania, alemán'', and in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''(Yr) Almaen, almaeneg'' are derived from the name of this early Germanic nation. Persian and Arabic also designate Germans ''Almaani'', and Germany as ''Almaan'' in Persian and ''Almaania'' in Arabic. In Turkish, German is ''Alman'' and Germany is ''Almanya''.

The region of the Alamanni was always somewhat sprawling and comprised a number of different districts, reflecting its mixed origins. In the [[Early Middle Ages]] its territories were divided between the [[Bishopric of Strasbourg|Diocese of Strassburg]], which dates from about 614, the territory of ''Augusta Vindelicorum''  ([[Bishopric of Augsburg|Augsburg]]) from 736, the ''Moguntiacum'' ([[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]]) archdiocese from 745, and of '' Basilia''  ([[Bishopric of Basel|Basel]]) from 805.  Its distinctive laws were codified under [[Charlemagne]] as the Duchy of Alamannia in Swabia. Today the descendants of the Alamanni are divided between parts of four nations: France (Alsace), Germany (Swabia and parts of Bavaria), Switzerland and Austria, and the [[German language|German]] spoken in those regions has distinctive regional dialects.

==Language==
[[File:Alemannic-Dialects-Map-English.png|thumb|The traditional distribution area of Western Upper German (=Alemannic) dialect features in the 19th and 20th century]]

The German spoken today over the range of the former Alemanni is termed [[Alemannic German]], and is recognised among the subgroups of the [[High German languages]]. Alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the [[Pforzen buckle]] are among the earliest testimonies of [[Old High German]].
The [[High German consonant shift]] is thought to have originated around the 5th century either in Alemannia or among the [[Langobards]]; before that the dialect spoken by Alemannic tribes was little different from that of other West Germanic peoples.

''Alemannia'' lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when [[Charles Martel]] absorbed it into the Frankish empire, early in the 8th century. Today, ''Alemannic'' is a linguistic term, referring to [[Alemannic German]], encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of [[Baden-Württemberg]] (German State), in western [[Bavaria]] (German State), in [[Vorarlberg]] (Austrian State), [[Swiss German]] in Switzerland and the [[Alsatian language]] of the [[Alsace]] (France).

==Origin==
===Name===
According to [[Asinius Quadratus]] (quoted in the mid-6th century by Byzantine historian [[Agathias]]) their name means &quot;all men&quot;. It indicates that they were a conglomeration drawn from various Germanic tribes. This was the derivation of ''Alamanni'' used by [[Edward Gibbon]], in his ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap10.htm#MIX Chapter 10]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of [[Nicolas Fréret]], published in 1753, who noted that it was the name used by outsiders for those who called themselves the [[Suevi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, avec les Mémoires de Littérature tirés des Registres de cette Académie, depuis l'année MDCCXLIV jusques et compris l'année MDCCXLVI'', vol. XVIII, (Paris 1753) pp.49–71.  Excerpts are on-line at [http://www.eliohs.unifi.it/testi/700/freret/vues.html#notaed ELIOHS].&lt;/ref&gt;   This etymology has remained the standard derivation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;It is cited in most etymological dictionaries, such as the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' (large edition) under the root, [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE295.html *man-].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walafrid Strabo]], a monk of the [[Abbey of St. Gall]] writing in the 9th century remarked, in discussing the people of Switzerland and the surrounding regions, that only foreigners called them the Alamanni, but that they gave themselves the name of [[Suevi]].

The [[Names of Germany|names for Germany]] in many modern Romance languages like French, Spanish and Portuguese derive from the name of the Alamanni.

===First explicit mention===
[[Image:Alamannischi Girtelbschleg.jpg|thumb|Alemannic belt mountings, from a 7th century grave in the [[Alemannic grave field|grave field]] at [[Weingarten (Württemberg)|Weingarten]].]]
The Alamanni were first mentioned by [[Cassius Dio]] describing the campaign of [[Caracalla]] in 213. At that time they apparently dwelt in the basin of the [[Main River|Main]], to the south of the [[Chatti]].

[[Cassius Dio]] ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html 78.13.4]) portrays the Alamanni as victims of this treacherous emperor. They had asked for his help, says Dio, but instead he colonized their country, changed their place names and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid. When he became ill, the Alamanni claimed to have put a hex on him (78.15.2).  Caracalla, it was claimed, tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits.

In retribution Caracalla then led the [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|Legio II ''Traiana Fortis'']] against the Alamanni, who lost and were pacified for a time. The legion was as a result honored with the name ''Germanica''. The [[Historia Augusta]], ''Life of Antoninus Caracalla'', relates ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html 10.5]) that Caracalla then assumed the name ''Alamannicus'', at which Helvius Pertinax jested that he should really be called ''Geticus Maximus'', because in the year before he had murdered his brother, [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]]. Not on good terms with Caracalla, Geta had been invited to a family reconciliation, at which time he was ambushed by centurions in Caracalla's army and slain in his mother Julia's arms. True or not, Caracalla, pursued by devils of his own, left Rome never to return.

Caracalla left for the frontier, where for the rest of his short reign he was known for his unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations. If he had any reasons of state for such actions they remained unknown to his contemporaries. Whether or not the Alamanni had been previously neutral, they were certainly further influenced by Caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of Rome.

This mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the Roman writers persisted in calling the Alamanni ''barbari'', &quot;savages&quot;. The archaeology, however, shows that they were largely Romanized, lived in Roman-style houses and used Roman artifacts, the Alemannic women having adopted the Roman fashion of the ''[[tunic]]'' even earlier than the men.

Most of them probably were in fact resident in or close to the borders of Germania Superior. Although Dio is the earliest writer to mention them, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] used the name to refer to Germans on the [[Limes Germanicus]] in the time of [[Trajan]]'s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed, circa 98/99. At that time the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time. Trees from the earliest fortifications found in [[Germania Inferior]] are dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 99/100.  Shortly afterwards Trajan was chosen by [[Nerva]] to be his successor, adopted with public fanfare in absentia by the old man shortly before his death. By 100 Trajan was back in Rome as Emperor instead of merely being a Consul.

Ammianus relates ([http://www.gmu.edu/departments/fld/CLASSICS/ammianus17.html xvii.1.11]) that much later the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] undertook a [[punitive expedition]] against the Alamanni, who by then were in Alsace, and crossed the Main (Latin ''Menus''), entering the forest, where the trails were blocked by felled trees. As winter was upon them, they reoccupied a
:&quot;''munimentum quod in Alamannorum solo conditum Traianus suo nomine voluit appellari''&quot;
:&quot;A fortification which was founded on the soil of the Alamanni that Trajan wished to be called with his own name&quot;
In this context the use of Alamanni is possibly an anachronism but it reveals that Ammianus believed they were the same people, which is consistent with the location of the Alamanni of Caracalla's campaigns.

===Alemanni and Hermunduri===
The early detailed source, the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]], has sometimes been interpreted in such a way as to provide yet other historical problems. In [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01040.htm Chapter 42] we read of the [[Hermunduri]], a tribe certainly located in the region that later became [[Thuringia]]. Tacitus stated that they traded with [[Rhaetia]], which in Ptolemy is located across the Danube from [[Germania Superior]]. A logical conclusion to draw is that the Hermunduri extended over later [[Swabia]] and therefore the Alamanni originally derived from the Hermunduri!

However, no Hermunduri appear in Ptolemy, though after the time of Ptolemy the Hermunduri joined with the [[Marcomanni]] in the wars of 166–180 against the empire. A careful reading of Tacitus provides one solution. He says that the source of the [[Elbe]] is among the Hermunduri, somewhat to the east of the upper [[Main (river)|Main]]. He places them also between the [[Naristi]] (Varisti), whose location at the very edge of the ancient [[Black Forest]] is well known, and the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]]. Moreover, the Hermunduri were broken in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] and made a separate peace with Rome. The Alamanni thus were probably not primarily the Hermunduri, although some elements of them may have been present in the mix of peoples at that time that became Alamannian.

===Ptolemy's ''Geography''===
Before the mention of ''Alamanni'' in the time of Caracalla, you would search in vain for Alamanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern Germany in Claudius [[Ptolemy]], written in Greek in the mid-2nd century; it is likely that at that time, the people who later used that name were known by other designations.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy's description has some limitations. Upper Germany and Lower Germany are mentioned by name, but only as specific districts of Gallia Belgica (2.8), the border between them was an unidentified river, the Obruncus. The region is repeated again under Germany, but this time he does not list Roman boundaries. Germania Superior, the Agri Decumates and the limes are not to be found there, even though they certainly existed at the time. &quot;Germania Magna&quot; is found within the Rhine, Danube, Vistula and shores of the &quot;Oceanus Germanicus&quot;. Most of the tribes are missing or listed without name. The Main is not there, nor Lake Constance. The Danube runs from the Alps. The Rhine does not bend to the south next to Swabia. Ptolemy's Germania is like a surreal image of itself, accurate only if you follow certain known lines, but the overall shape is greatly distorted.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless some conclusions can be drawn from Ptolemy. Germania Superior is easily identified. Following up the Rhine one comes to a town, Mattiacum, which must be at the border of the Roman Germany (vicinity of [[Wiesbaden]]). Upstream from it and between the Rhine and [[Abnoba]] (in the [[Black Forest]]) are the [[Ingriones]], [[Intuergi]], [[Vangiones]], [[Caritni]] and [[Vispi]], some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before. On the other side of the northern Black Forest were the [[Chatti]] about where [[Hesse]] is today, on the lower Main.

Historic [[Swabia]] was eventually replaced by today's [[Baden-Württemberg]], but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval [[Alamannia]], comprising all Germania Superior and territory east to [[Bavaria]]. It did not include the upper Main, but that is where Caracalla campaigned. Moreover, the territory of Germania Superior was not originally included among the Alemanni's possessions.

However, if we look for the peoples in the region from the upper Main in the north, south to the Danube and east to the [[Czech Republic]] where the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] were located, Ptolemy does not give any tribes. There are the [[Tubanti]] just south of the [[Chatti]] and at the other end of what was then the Black Forest, the [[Varisti]], whose location is known. One possible reason for this distribution is that the population preferred not to live in the forest except in troubled times. The region between the forest and the [[Danube]] on the other hand included about a dozen settlements, or &quot;cantons&quot;.

Ptolemy's view of Germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the Black Forest region and was replaced by a canton structure. The tribes stayed in the Roman province, perhaps because the Romans offered stability. Also, Caracalla perhaps{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper Main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe, such as the Chatti or [[Cherusci]], against whom Rome had suffered grievous losses. By Caracalla's time the name ''Alamanni'' was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army (the &quot;war bands&quot;).

===Concentration of Germanic peoples under Ariovistus===
The term Suebi has a double meaning in the sources. On the one hand Tacitus' ''Germania'' tells us ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01030.htm Chapters 38, 39)] that they occupy more than half of Germany, use a distinctive hair style, and are spiritually centered on the [[Semnones]]. On the other hand the Suebi of the upper Danube are described as though they were a tribe.

The solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the Agri Decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of Germans there are probably to be found in the German attack on the Gallic fortified town of [[Vesontio]] in 58 BC. The upper Rhine and Danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at Vesontio.

[[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' tells us ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div2 1.51]) that [[Ariovistus]] had gathered an army from a wide region of Germany, but especially the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Triboci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]] and [[Sedusii]]. The Suebi were being invited to join. They lived in 100 cantons ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=4&amp;division=div2 4.1]) from which 1000 young men per year were chosen for military service, a citizen-army by our standards and by comparison with the Roman professional army.

Ariovistus had become involved in an invasion of [[Gaul]], which the German wished to settle. Intending to take the strategic town of Vesontio, he concentrated his forces on the Rhine near Lake Constance, and when the Suebi arrived, he crossed. The Gauls had called to Rome for military aid. Caesar occupied the town first and defeated the Germans before its walls, slaughtering most of the German army as it tried to flee across the river (1.36ff). He did not pursue the retreating remnants, leaving what was left of the German army and their dependents intact on the other side of the Rhine.

The Gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the Romans. In 53 BC the [[Treveri]] broke their alliance and attempted to break free of Rome. Caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the Germans. He crossed the Rhine to forestall that event, a successful strategy. Remembering their expensive defeat at the Battle of Vesontio, the Germans withdrew to the Black Forest, concentrating there a mixed population dominated by Suebi. As they had left their tribal homes behind, they probably took over all the former Celtic cantons along the Danube.

&lt;!-- This material will be going back in as soon as I set up for it: The Alamanni emerged from the [[Irminones]]. Other groups included the [[Brisgavi]], [[Juthungi]], [[Bucinobantes]], [[Lentienses]], and perhaps the [[Armalausi]]. Close allies of the Alamanni were the East Germanic  [[Suebi]], or Suabi (hence [[Swabia]]). The Hermunduri had apparently belonged to the Suebi, but it is likely enough that reinforcements from new Suebic tribes had now moved westward. In later times the names ''Alamanni'' and ''Suebi'' seem to become synonymous, although some of the Suebi later migrated to [[Hispania]] and established an independent kingdom there that endured well into the 6th century. --&gt;

==Political organization==
The Alamanni established a series of territorially defined ''pagi'' (cantons) on the east bank of the Rhine. The exact number and extent of these ''pagi'' is unclear and probably changed over time.

''Pagi'', usually pairs of ''pagi'' combined, formed kingdoms (''regna'') which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary. Ammianus describes Alamanni rulers with various terms: ''reges excelsiores ante alios'' (&quot;paramount kings&quot;), ''reges proximi'' (&quot;neighbouring kings&quot;), ''reguli'' (&quot;petty kings&quot;) and ''regales'' (&quot;princes&quot;). This may be a formal hierarchy, or they may be vague, overlapping terms, or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (2007) 118, 120&lt;/ref&gt; In 357, there appear to have been two paramount kings (Chnodomar and Westralp) who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings (''reges''). Their territories were small and mostly strung along the Rhine (although a few were in the hinterland).&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (2007) 223 (map)&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the ''reguli'' were the rulers of the two ''pagi'' in each kingdom. Underneath the royal class were the nobles (called ''optimates'' by the Romans) and warriors (called ''armati'' by the Romans). The warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free men.&lt;ref&gt;Speidel (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Each nobleman could raise an average of ca. 50 warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (2007) 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts with the Roman Empire==
[[Image:Karte limes.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Limes Germanicus]] AD 83 to 260.]]
{{Campaignbox Rome against the Alamanni}}
The Alamanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the [[Roman Empire]]. They launched a major invasion of [[Gaul]] and northern [[Italy]] in 268, when the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the [[Goths]] from the east. Their raids throughout the three parts of Gaul were traumatic: [[Gregory of Tours]] (died ca 594) mentions their destructive force at the time of [[Valerian I|Valerian]] and [[Gallienus]] (253&amp;ndash;260), when the Alemanni assembled under their &quot;king&quot;, whom he calls [[Chrocus]], who &quot;by the advice, it is said, of his wicked mother, and overran the whole of the Gauls, and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times. And coming to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call ''Vasso Galatae'' in the Gallic tongue,&quot; martyring many Christians ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 ''Historia Francorum'' Book I.32&amp;ndash;34]). Thus 6th century Gallo-Romans of Gregory's class, surrounded by the ruins of [[Roman temple]]s and public buildings, attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the Alemanni.

In the early summer of 268, the [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] [[Gallienus]] halted their advance into Italy, but then had to deal with the Goths. When the Gothic campaign ended in Roman victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in September, Gallienus' successor [[Claudius II|Claudius II Gothicus]] turned north to deal with the Alamanni, who were swarming over all Italy north of the [[Po River]].

After efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed, Claudius forced the Alamanni to battle at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in November. The Alamanni were routed, forced back into Germany, and did not threaten Roman territory for many years afterwards.

Their most famous battle against Rome took place in [[Argentoratum]] ([[Strasbourg]]), in 357, where they were defeated by [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], later Emperor of Rome, and their king [[Chnodomarius]] was taken prisoner to Rome.

On January 2 [[366]] the Alamanni yet again crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Gallic provinces, this time being defeated by Valentinian (see [[Battle of Solicinium]]).
In the great mixed invasion of 406, the Alamanni appear to have crossed the [[Rhine|Rhine river]] a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]]. The crossing is described in Wallace Breem's historical novel &quot;Eagle in the Snow.&quot;
[[Fredegar]]'s Chronicle gives the account. At ''Alba Augusta'' ([[Alba-la-Romaine]]) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishop retired to [[Viviers]], but in Gregory's account at Mende in [[Lozère]], also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.  It is thought{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence.

==Alamanni and Franks==
[[Image:Alamannien Hochburgund ca 1000.png|thumb|250px|Alemannia (yellow) and Upper Burgundy (green) around 1000.]]
{{main|Alamannia}}
The kingdom  of [[Alamannia]] between Strasbourg and Augsburg lasted until 496, when the Alamanni were conquered by [[Clovis I]] at the [[Battle of Tolbiac]]. The war of Clovis with the Alamanni forms the setting for the conversion of Clovis, briefly treated by [[Gregory of Tours]] ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gregory-clovisconv.html#n30 Book II.31]) Subsequently the Alamanni formed part of the [[Franks|Frankish]] dominions and were governed by a Frankish duke.

In 746, [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]] ended an uprising by summarily executing all Alemannic nobility at the [[blood court at Cannstatt]], and for the following century, Alamannia was ruled by Frankish dukes. Following the [[treaty of Verdun]] of 843, Alamannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]], the precursor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The duchy persisted until 1268.

[[File:Gutenstein warrior.jpg|thumb|The 7th century [[:de:Schwertscheide von Gutenstein|Gutenstein scabbard]], found near [[Sigmaringen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], is a late testimony of pagan ritual in Alemannia,  showing a warrior in ritual wolf costume, holding a [[ring-spatha]].]]
The [[Christianization]] of the Alamanni took place during [[Merovingian]] times (6th to 8th centuries). We know that in the 6th century, the Alamanni were predominantly [[Alemannic paganism|pagan]], and in the 8th century, they were predominantly Christian. The intervening 7th century was a period of genuine [[syncretism]] during which Christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence.

Some scholars have speculated that members of the Alamannic elite such as king [[Gibuld]] due to [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] influence may have been converted to [[Arianism]] even in the later 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, Hans (1909). ''Das älteste germanische Christentum oder der Sogenannte &quot;Arianismus&quot; der Germanen''. Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr. pg.32. Cf. also Bossert, G. &quot;Alemanni&quot; in: Jackson, S.M. (Ed.). ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', Vol. 1, pg. 114: &quot;[the Alamannic] prince, Gibuld, was an Arian, probably converted by Goths&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-6th century, the Byzantine historian [[Agathias of Myrina]] records, in the context of the wars of the Goths and Franks against Byzantium, that the Alamanni fighting among the troops of Frankish king [[Theudebald]] were like the Franks in all respects except religion, since 
:&quot;they worship certain trees, the waters of rivers, hills and mountain valleys, in whose honour they sacrifice horses, cattle and countless other animals by beheading them, and imagine that they are performing an act of piety thereby.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PqsJZcQR7oIC trans.  Joseph D. Frendo (1975)]&lt;/ref&gt;
He also spoke of the particular ruthlessness of the Alamani in destroying Christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine Franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries. Agathias expresses his hope that the Alamanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the Franks, which is by all appearances, in a manner of speaking, what eventually happened.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Apostles of the Alamanni were [[Saint Columbanus]] and his disciple [[Saint Gall]]. [[Jonas of Bobbio]] records that Columbanus was active in [[Bregenz]], where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to [[Wodan]]. Despite these activities, for some time, the Alamanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities, with only superficial or [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] Christian elements. In particular, there is no change in burial practice, and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout Merovingian times. Syncretism of traditional Germanic animal-style with Christian symbolism is also present in artwork, but Christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century. Unlike the later Christianization of the Saxon and of the Slavs, the Alamanni seem to have adopted Christianity gradually, and voluntarily, spread in emulation of the Merovingian elite.

From ca. the 520s to the 620s, there was a surge of [[Alamannic Elder Futhark inscriptions]]. About 70 specimens have survived, roughly half of them on [[fibula]]e, others on belt buckles (see [[Pforzen buckle]], [[Bülach fibula]]) and other jewelry and weapon parts. Use of runes subsides with the advance of Christianity.
The [[Nordendorf fibula]] (early 7th century) clearly records pagan theonyms, '''logaþorewodanwigiþonar ''' read as  &quot;Wodan and Donar are magicians/sorcerers&quot;, but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities, or a Christian protective charm against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Düwel&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Düwel |first=Klaus |authorlink= |editor-last=Kamp |editor-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Wollasch |editor2-first=Joachim |contribution=Runen und Interpretatio Christiana: Zur Religioneschichtlichen Stellung der Bügelfidel von Nordendorf I |title=Tradition als Historische Kraft |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |location= |pages=78–86 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tQ_Mmjx5hSIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |id= |isbn=3-11-0082237-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A runic inscription on a fibula found at [[Bad Ems]] reflects Christian pious sentiment (and is also explicitly marked with a Christian cross), reading '''god fura dih deofile ᛭''' (&quot;God for/before you, Theophilus!&quot;, or alternatively &quot;God before you, Devil!&quot;). Dated to between AD 660 and 690, it marks the end of the native Alemannic tradition of runic literacy. Bad Ems is in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], on the northwestern boundary of Alemannic settlement, where Frankish influence would have been strongest.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Jungandreas, 'God fura dih, deofile †' in: Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur, 101, 1972, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the bishopric of [[Konstanz]] cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by Columbanus himself (before 612). In any case, it existed by 635, when [[Gunzo]] appointed [[John of Grab]] bishop. Constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands, and did not look back on late Roman church history (unlike the Raetian bishopric of [[Chur]], established 451) and [[Basel]], which was an episcopal seat from 740, and which continued the line of Bishops of [[Augusta Raurica]], see [[Bishop of Basel]]. The establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history. In the early 7th century ''[[Pactus Alamannorum]]'' hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church, while [[Lantfrid]]'s ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' of 720 has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone.

'''NYSE Amex Equities''', formerly known as the '''American Stock Exchange''' ('''AMEX''') is an [[United States|American]] [[stock exchange]] situated in [[New York City|New York]]. AMEX was a [[mutual organization]], owned by its members. Until 1953, it was known as the '''New York Curb Exchange'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Maury|title=Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-513516-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 17, 2008, [[NYSE Euronext]] announced it would acquire the American Stock Exchange for $260 million in stock.

==History==
In the early 19th century, many new enterprises sprang up in the railroad and construction industries. The [[NYSE|New York Exchange Board]] had then mandated an organization to have a minimum of 100 stocks in order to trade in their exchange. Many of these new companies could not meet such requirements to be listed on the Board. A group of non-member brokers catered to the needs of these companies as they traded their stocks outside the registered exchanges. These brokers came to be known as the [[curbstone]] brokers, as they conducted their auctions out in the street. 

[[File:Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Curb brokers, 1920]]
These brokers often traded stocks that were speculative in nature. With the discovery of oil in the later half of 19th century, even oil stocks entered into the curb market. By 1865, following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], stocks in small industrial companies, such as iron and steel, textiles and chemicals were first sold by curbstone brokers. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the twentieth century under [[Emanuel S. Mendels]]. In 1908, the New York Curb Market Agency was established, to codify trading practices. In 1911, the curbstone brokers came to be known as the New York Curb Market, which then had a formal constitution with brokerage and listing standards. After several years of outdoor trading, the curbstone brokers moved indoors in 1921 to a building on [[Greenwich Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined. In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.

[[Paul Kolton]] was named as president of the exchange in 1971, making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Rustin, Richard E.

'''Alfred Russel Wallace''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (8 January 1823&amp;nbsp;– 7 November 1913) was a British [[Natural history|naturalist]], explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist. He is best known for independently proposing a theory of [[evolution]] due to [[natural selection]] that prompted [[Charles Darwin]] to publish his own theory.

Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the [[Amazon River]] basin and then in the [[Malay Archipelago]], where he identified the [[Wallace Line]] that divides the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago into two distinct parts, one in which animals closely related to those of Australia are common, and one in which the species are largely of Asian origin. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the &quot;father of [[biogeography]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Introduction|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/chsarwin.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made a number of other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of [[Aposematism|warning colouration]] in animals, and the [[Wallace effect]], a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to [[speciation]] by encouraging the development of barriers against [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].

Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas. His advocacy of [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] and his belief in a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-material origin]] for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with the scientific establishment, especially with other early proponents of evolution. In addition to his scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and [[capitalism|economic system]] in 19th-century Britain. His interest in biogeography resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. Wallace was a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', was one of the most popular and influential journals of scientific exploration published during the 19th century.

His family, like many Scottish Wallaces, claimed a connection to [[William Wallace]], a Scottish leader during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=WKU_bio/&gt; Thomas Wallace received a law degree, but never actually practiced law. He inherited some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a respectable middle-class [[England|English]] family from [[Hertford]], north of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;WKU_bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: A Capsule Biography|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford. There he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]] until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace then moved to London to live and work with his older brother John, a 19-year-old apprentice builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. While there, he attended lectures and read books at the [[London Mechanics Institute]]. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]] and [[Thomas Paine]]. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years. At the end of 1839, they moved to [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]], Hereford, near the Welsh border before eventually settling at [[Neath]] in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotten ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court'' pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions. Wallace left in January, aged 20. One result of Wallace's early travels has been a modern controversy about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in Gwent (then called Monmouthshire), Wales, some sources have considered him to be Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=28. Alfred Russel Wallace|publisher=100 Welsh heroes|url=http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/alfredrussellwallace|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that because of these facts the most reasonable interpretation was that he was an Englishman born in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Was Wallace actually a Welshman, as seems to be increasingly claimed?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm#Welsh|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]] to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent a lot of time at the Leicester library where he read ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Malthus]] and where one evening he met the entomologist [[Henry Bates]]. Bates was only 19 years old, but had already published a paper on beetles in the journal ''Zoologist''. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer ''In Darwin's Shadow'' p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt; William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but he and his brother John were unable to make the business work. After a couple of months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the [[River Neath|Vale of Neath]]. Wallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace was able to persuade his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Mechanics' Institute of Neath. William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, he, aged 23, and John were able to purchase a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymously published evolutionary treatise ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', Charles Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal]]'', and [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Raby  p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace ''My Life'' pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A237.1&amp;pageseq=287 254], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A237.1&amp;pageseq=289 256]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploration and study of the natural world===
[[Image:Wallace map archipelago.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map from ''The Malay Archipelago'' shows the physical geography of the archipelago and Wallace's travels around the area. The thin black lines indicate where Wallace travelled, and the red lines indicate chains of volcanoes.]]

Inspired by the chronicles of earlier traveling naturalists, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[William Henry Edwards]], Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, Wallace and [[Henry Bates]] left for [[Brazil]] aboard the ''Mischief''. Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon rainforest]] and sell them to collectors back in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. They also hoped to gather evidence of the [[transmutation of species]]. Wallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near [[Belém do Pará]], then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist [[Richard Spruce]], along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from [[yellow fever]]), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98–99, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace continued charting the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Raby  pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig ''Helen''. After 28 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, the vast majority of what he had collected during his entire trip, were lost. He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches. Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig ''Jordeson'', which was sailing from Cuba to London. The ''Jordenson'''s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slotten87-88&quot;&gt;Slotten pp. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the Rio Negro. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included &quot;On the Monkeys of the Amazon&quot;) and two books; ''Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses'' and ''Travels on the Amazon''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists—most significantly, Darwin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slotten87-88&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raby  p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibliography&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An illustration from ''The Malay Archipelago'' depicts the flying frog Wallace discovered.]]

From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the [[Malay Archipelago]] or [[East Indies]] (now [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]), to collect specimens for sale and to study nature. His observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]]. Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). More than a thousand of them represented species new to science.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog ''[[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus]]'', known as Wallace's [[flying frog]]. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]]. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.

Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''. ''The Malay Archipelago'' became one of the most popular journals of scientific exploration of the 19th century, kept continuously in print by its original publisher (Macmillan) into the second decade of the 20th century. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and [[Charles Lyell]], and by non-scientists such as the novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], who called it his &quot;favorite bedside companion&quot; and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially ''[[Lord Jim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the UK, marriage and children===
[[Image:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumbnail|right|200px|A photograph of A.R. Wallace taken in [[Singapore]] in 1862]]

In 1862, Wallace returned to the UK, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the [[Zoological Society of London]]. Later that year, he visited Darwin at [[Down House]], and became friendly with both [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including [[sexual selection]], [[warning colouration]], and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 249–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist [[Richard Spruce]], who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, [[William Mitten]], an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built [[The Dell (Thurrock)|the Dell]], a house of concrete, on land he leased in [[Grays]] in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867–1874) who died in childhood, Violet (1869–1945), and William (1871–1951).&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 239–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial struggles===
In the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 265–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as curatorship of a museum. In order to remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Wallace needed a £500 advance from the publisher of ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the [[pound sterling|£]]200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 361–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social activism===
[[John Stuart Mill]] was impressed by remarks criticizing English society that Wallace had included in ''The Malay Archipelago''. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace wrote only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and [[land reform]] in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in English society. In 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, ''Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims'', on the subject. He criticised the UK's [[free trade]] policies for the negative impact they had on working class people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibliography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred Russel Wallace|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/index1.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 365–72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Wallace read ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] and declared himself a [[socialist]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas led him to oppose both [[social Darwinism]] and [[eugenics]], ideas supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a [[Fiat currency|pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold]], which impressed the economist [[Irving Fisher]] so much that he dedicated his 1920 book ''Stabilizing the Dollar'' to Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Paper Money as a Standard of Value (S557: 1898)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S557.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace wrote extensively on other social topics including his support for [[women's suffrage]], and the dangers and wastefulness of [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 366, 453, 487–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 23, 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book ''The Revolt of Democracy'' just weeks before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Revolt of Democracy (S734: 1913)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S734.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary. In 1880, he published ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographic Distribution of Animals''. In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the [[United States]] to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution and natural selection), but he also gave speeches on [[biogeography]], spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to [[California]] years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist [[Alice Eastwood]] as his guide, exploring the flora of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how [[glaciation]] might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper &quot;English and American Flowers&quot;. He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book ''Darwinism'' used information he collected on his American trip, and information he had compiled for the lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 274–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 379–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

It features a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall fossil tree trunk from Portland mounted on a block of Purbeck limestone.]]

On 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slotten490&quot;&gt;Slotten p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; He was 90 years old. His death was widely reported in the press. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him &quot;the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included, among others, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, and Owen, whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century.&quot; Another commentator in the same edition said “No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'.”&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at [[Broadstone, Dorset]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slotten490&quot;/&gt; Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.

==Theory of evolution==
===Early evolutionary thinking===
Unlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the [[transmutation of species]]. The concept had been advocated by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], and [[Robert Edmond Grant|Robert Grant]], among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have [[radicalism (historical)|radical]], even revolutionary connotations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson73&quot;&gt;Larson Evolution p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowler &amp; Morus &quot;Making Modern Science&quot; p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent anatomists and geologists such as [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Richard Owen]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Charles Lyell]] attacked it vigorously.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan The Dragon Seekers pp. 101, 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson pp. 23–24, 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson73&quot;/&gt; and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer p. 54&quot;&gt;Shermer p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also profoundly influenced by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' work ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace wrote to [[Henry Bates]] in 1845:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have a rather more favourable opinion of the ‘Vestiges’ than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer p. 54&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson73&quot;/&gt; During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers—such as the Amazon and its major tributaries—often separated the ranges of closely allied species, and he included these observations in his 1853 paper &quot;On the Monkeys of the Amazon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the paper he asks the question &quot;Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?&quot;

In February 1855, while working in the state of [[Sarawak]] on the island of [[Borneo]], Wallace wrote &quot;On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species&quot;, a paper which was published in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Annals and Magazine of Natural History]]'' in September 1855. In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as [[biogeography]]. His conclusion that &quot;Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species&quot; has come to be known as the &quot;Sarawak Law&quot;. Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species|url=http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm|year=1855|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend [[Charles Darwin]] had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did [[Edward Blyth]] who thought it &quot;Good! Upon the whole!... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into ''species''.&quot; Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the [[progressive creationism]] of the time and wrote that it was &quot;nothing very new ... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.&quot; Lyell was more impressed, and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of [[natural selection]] to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a ''species sketch'' of his continuing work in May 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond &amp; Moore ''Darwin'' 1991, p. 438;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Browne ''Charles Darwin: Voyaging'' pp. 537–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection and Darwin===
{{see also|Publication of Darwin's theory}}

By February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the [[Malay Archipelago]] of the reality of evolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem then was not only how and why do species change, but how and why do they change into new and well defined species, distinguished from each other in so many ways; why and how they become so exactly adapted to distinct modes of life; and why do all the intermediate grades die out (as geology shows they have died out) and leave only clearly defined and well marked species, genera, and higher groups of animals?&lt;ref&gt;Wallace ''My Life'' p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to his autobiography, it was while he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about [[Thomas Malthus]]'s idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with the idea of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of [[Ternate]] at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the collection registries he wrote at the time, he was more likely to have been on the island of [[Halmahera|Gilolo]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace describes it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It then occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live ... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about ... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace ''My Life'' pp. 361–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Darwin-Wallace medal.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Darwin–Wallace Medal]] was issued by the Linnean society on the 50th anniversary of the reading of Darwin and Wallace's papers on [[natural selection]].]]

Wallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letters to Darwin have been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, 1916. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1593&amp;viewtype=image&amp;pageseq=116 p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper &quot;On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species&quot; of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=111 p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt; The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that &quot;without speculation there is no good and original observation&quot; while commenting that &quot;I believe I go much further than you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=124 p. 108]&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, &quot;[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type]]&quot;, with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to [[Charles Lyell]] if he thought it worthwhile.&lt;ref name=&quot;tendency&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the manuscript from Wallace. While Wallace's essay did not employ Darwin's term &quot;natural selection&quot;, it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to [[Charles Lyell]] with a letter saying &quot;he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 153–54&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=132 p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt; Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority.  Wallace had not asked for publication of his essay, but publishing the contents of letters from far-off naturalists was a common event in those times.  Wallace's essay was presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to [[Asa Gray]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 33–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication with Wallace in far-off Malay was impossible without months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication.  Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;&lt;ref&gt;Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; but, with Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life. Over the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested that not only had there been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 157–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=In Darwin’s Shadow: Excerpt|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/darwins-shadow/excerpt/|publisher=michaelshermer.com|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Did Darwin really steal material from Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of Darwin’s ''On the Origin of Species'', Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper &quot;Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species&quot; in order to utterly demolish a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin’s comments in the ''Origin'' on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 197–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable defence of the ''Origin'' was &quot;Creation by Law&quot;, a review Wallace wrote in 1867 for ''The Quarterly Journal of Science'' of the book ''The Reign of Law'', which had been written by the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] as a refutation of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Creation by Law (S140: 1867)

==== Differences between Darwin's and Wallace's ideas on natural selection ====
Historians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Others have noted that another difference was that Wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism keeping species and varieties adapted to their environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unfinished Business&quot;/&gt; They point to a largely overlooked passage of Wallace's famous 1858 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The action of this principle is exactly like that of the [[centrifugal governor]] of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;tendency&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[cybernetics|cybernetician]] and anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] would observe in the 1970s that, though writing it only as an example, Wallace had &quot;probably said the most powerful thing that’d been said in the 19th Century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brand|first=Stewart|title=For God’s Sake, Margaret|url=http://www.oikos.org/forgod.htm|publisher=CoEvolutionary Quarterly, June 1976|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson revisited the topic in his 1979 book ''Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity'', and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and [[systems theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Unfinished Business&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Wallace's Unfinished Business|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/essays/UNFIN.htm|publisher=Complexity (publisher Wiley Periodicals, Inc.)

==== Warning colouration and sexual selection ====
In 1867, Darwin wrote to Wallace about a problem he was having understanding how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes. Darwin had come to believe that [[sexual selection]], an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. &quot;Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight&quot;, Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic. In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace’s idea. [[Aposematism|Warning colouration]] was one of a number of contributions Wallace made in the area of the evolution of [[Colours of animals|animal colouration]] in general and the concept of protective colouration in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 251–54.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also part of a life-long disagreement Wallace had with Darwin over the importance of sexual selection. In his 1878 book ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'', he wrote extensively on the colouration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 353–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book ''Darwinism''.

==== Wallace effect ====
In 1889, Wallace wrote the book ''Darwinism'', which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the [[Wallace effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 413–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridization in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ollerton|first=J|title=Flowering time and the Wallace Effect|url=http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Heredity, August 2005|accessdate=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application of theory to man, and role of teleology in evolution===
[[Image:Wallace chimp.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|An illustration from the chapter on the application of [[natural selection]] to man in Wallace's 1889 book ''Darwinism'' shows a chimpanzee.]]

In 1864, Wallace published a paper, &quot;The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'&quot;, applying the theory to humankind. Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although [[Thomas Huxley]] had in ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not &quot;regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape&quot;.&lt;ref name=eiseley&gt;
{{cite book|last=Eiseley|first=Loren|title=Darwin's Century|publisher=Anchor Book|year=1958|p=305,6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the evolution of man in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the &quot;recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that...with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded.&quot;&lt;ref name=eiseley /&gt; For this paper he won Darwin's praise.

Shortly afterwards, Wallace became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]]. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in &quot;the unseen universe of Spirit&quot; had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind. He also believed that the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of the universe was the development of the human spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace ''Darwinism'' p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 157–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter Six.

[[Charles Lyell]] endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's.&lt;ref&gt;Larson p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer231&quot;&gt;Shermer pp. 231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 280–96.&lt;/ref&gt; As the historian of science [[Michael Shermer]] has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not [[teleological]] (purpose driven) and that it was not [[anthropocentric]] (human centered).&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 208–09.&lt;/ref&gt; Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled ''The World of Life'', which he later expanded into a book of the same name;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer231&quot;/&gt;

===Assessment of Wallace's role in history of evolutionary theory===
In many accounts of the [[history of evolutionary thought|of the development of evolutionary theory]], Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory.&lt;ref name = &quot;Slotten_p6&quot;&gt;Slotten p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', often in strong disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but Wallace and [[August Weismann]] were nearly alone among prominent biologists in believing that natural selection was the major driving force behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Larson p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowler &amp; Morus p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Wallace published the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all Wallace's books, it is cited by scholarly publications the most.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritualism==
In a letter to his brother-in-law in 1861, Wallace wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity ... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=1861 Letter from Wallace to Thomas Sims|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace was an enthusiast of [[phrenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 203–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, he experimented with [[hypnosis]], then known as [[mesmerism]]. He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects, with considerable success.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt; When he began his experiments with mesmerism, the topic was very controversial and early experimenters, such as [[John Elliotson]], had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belief and Spiritualism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter One. Belief and Spiritualism|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/chsarw1.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and his later investigations into [[spiritualism]]. In 1893, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I thus learnt my first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Notes on the Growth of Opinion as to Obscure Psychical Phenomena During the Last Fifty Years|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S478.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at [[séance]]s, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belief and Spiritualism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer199201&quot;&gt;Shermer pp. 199–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritualism appealed to many educated [[Victorian morality|Victorians]] who no longer found traditional religious doctrine, such as that of the [[Church of England]], acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science.&lt;ref name = &quot;Slotten_p4&quot;&gt;Slotten p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belief and Spiritualism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer199201&quot;/&gt; Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer [[Robert Owen]], who was one of Wallace’s early idols,&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; the physicists [[William Crookes]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]], the mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]], and the Scottish publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Slotten_p4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation. It strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as [[Henry Bates]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Others, such as the physiologist [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] and zoologist [[E. Ray Lankester]] became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably [[William Crookes]], were subject to much criticism from the press, with ''[[The Lancet]]'' as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace’s work for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 298–351.&lt;/ref&gt; When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wallace has lost caste considerably, not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion of on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings. That he is said to have done so in an underhanded manner, and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biogeography and ecology==
[[Image:Wallace03.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|A map of the world from ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' shows Wallace's six biogeographical regions.]]

In 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, [[Philip Sclater]], and [[Alfred Newton]], Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Extending the bird system developed by Sclater—which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution—to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently [[Great American Interchange|connecting North America and South America]]) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveler to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on [[zoogeography]] for the next 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 320–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Wallace published the book ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals''. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and had never been part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonization and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like [[Madagascar]]) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the [[lemur]]s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased [[glaciation]], may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great [[ice age]]s. ''Island Life'' was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental issues===
Wallace’s extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'' (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy [[rainfall]]. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and [[India]] would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 352–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Island Life'', Wallace again talked about deforestation and also the impact of [[invasive species]]. He wrote the following about the impact of European colonization on the island of [[Saint Helena]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications!&lt;ref&gt;Wallace ''Island Life'' pp. 283–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other controversies==
===Flat Earth wager===
{{see also|Bedford Level experiment}}
In 1870, a [[Flat Earth|Flat-Earth]] proponent named [[John Hampden (1819-1891)|John Hampden]] offered a £500 wager (equivalent to about £{{inflation|UK|500|1870|r=-3}} in present day terms{{inflation-fn|UK}}) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10&amp;nbsp;km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water and in a straight line with a telescope he mounted on a bridge. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth. The judge for the wager, the editor of ''Field'' magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 258–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-vaccination campaign===
In the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox [[vaccination]]. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the [[germ theory of disease]] was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human [[immune system]] to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered cases where supporters of vaccination had used questionable statistics. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation. He also suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slotten422-436&quot;&gt;Slotten pp. 422–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer215&quot;/&gt; Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shermer215&quot;&gt;Shermer pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a [[Royal Commission]] investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. ''[[The Lancet]]'' stated that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet attacking the commission’s findings. It, in turn, was attacked by ''The Lancet'', which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slotten422-436&quot;/&gt;

===Martian canals===
In 1907, Wallace wrote the short book ''Is Mars Habitable?'' to criticise the claims made by [[Percival Lowell]] that there were [[Martian canals]] built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Slotten p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Wallace pointed out that [[spectroscopic analysis]] had shown no signs of water vapour in the Martian atmosphere, that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''Is Mars Habitable'' (S730: 1907)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace originally became interested in the topic because his [[anthropocentric]] philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and historical perception==
[[Image:Alfred Russel Wallace - Project Gutenberg eText 14558.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|A portrait of Alfred Russel Wallace is shown above his signature on the frontispiece of ''Darwinism'' (1889).]]

As a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 292–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such as election to the [[Royal Society]], the [[Copley Medal]], and one honour from the [[British monarch]]: the [[Order of Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28194|supp=yes|startpage=8162|date=9 November 1908|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure. He was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science.&lt;ref name = &quot;Slotten_p6&quot;/&gt; A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas. Recently, he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for ''New Yorker'' magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jonathan|title=Missing Link: Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin’s neglected double|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2007/02/12/070212crat_atlarge_rosen|publisher=The New Yorker Feb 2007|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm|publisher=hosted by Western Kentucky University|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings by Wallace==
Wallace was a prolific author. In 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books and at least 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibliography&quot;/&gt;

The '''Australian Labor Party''' ('''ALP'''; sometimes simply '''Labor''') is an [[List of political parties in Australia|Australian political party]]. It has been the governing party of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] since the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. [[Julia Gillard]] is the party's federal parliamentary leader and [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Labor also currently governs in [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]].    
Founded in 1891 by the emerging [[Australian labour movement|labour movement in Australia]], Labor is the country's longest running political party. Labor contested state seats from 1891 and federal seats following the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 federal election]]. Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]], at the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 federal election]]. The ALP predates both the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party]], among [[Labour Party|others]], in both party formation and government. The party competes against the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] for political office at the [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state]] (and sometimes [[Local government in Australia|local]]) level.

&lt;!-- do not add a second image of a current Labor Prime Minister here, this is for previous Labor Prime Ministers --&gt;
ALP mythology says the first party branch was founded at a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree (the &quot;[[Tree of Knowledge (Australia)|Tree of Knowledge]]&quot;) in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in 1891. The [[Balmain, New South Wales]] branch of the party also claims to be the oldest in Australia. The party as a serious electoral force dates from 1891 in New South Wales, 1893 in Queensland and South Australia, and later in the other colonies. In New South Wales in 1891, the first election contested by Labour candidates (as Labor was spelt at the time – see [[#Etymology|Etymology]]), 35 of 141 seats were won by Labour candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Page 4, So Monstrous a Travesty, Ross McMullen. Scribe Publications 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, [[Anderson Dawson]] formed a minority Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; government in [[Queensland]], the first in the world, which lasted one week.

Sections of state Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; and the [[Australian labour movement]] were mixed in their support for the [[Federation of Australia]]. Some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming the Senate as proposed was much too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist Colonial upper houses and the [[House of Lords|British House of Lords]]. They feared federation would distract attention from the need of [[reform movement|social]] and [[Labor relations|industrial]] reform, and further entrench the power of the [[conservatism|conservative]] forces. The first Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; leader and Prime Minister, [[Chris Watson]], was a supporter of federation but not its implementation.

After Federation, the Federal Parliamentary Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; Party (informally known as the [[Caucus]]) first met on 8 May 1901 at [[Parliament House, Melbourne]], the meeting place of the first Federal Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner; Macintyre (2001) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This is now taken as the founding date of the federal Labor Party, but it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level.

The ALP during its early years was distinguished by its rapid growth and success at a national level, first forming a [[minority government]] under [[Chris Watson]], the first Labour Prime Minister in the world, for four months in 1904. [[Andrew Fisher]] then formed another minority government 1908–09. At the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 federal election]], Fisher and Labour became Australia's first federal [[majority government]], held Australia's first [[Australian Senate|Senate]] majority, was the world's first [[Labour Party]] majority government, the first time the Labour Party had controlled ''any'' house of a legislature, and the first time it controlled ''both'' houses of a bicameral legislature.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state branches were also successful, except in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], where the strength of [[Alfred Deakin|Deakinite]] [[liberalism]] inhibited the party's growth. The state branches formed their first majority governments in [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]] in 1910, in [[Western Australia]] in 1911, and in [[Queensland]] in 1915. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years. One of the party's early innovations was the establishment of a federal [[arbitration]] system for the resolution of industrial disputes, which formed the basis of the industrial relations system for many decades. 

Through its membership of the [[Socialist International]], the ALP is affiliated with democratic socialist, social-democratic and labour parties in many countries. The party was historically committed to [[socialism|socialist]] economic policies, but this term was never clearly defined, and no Labor government ever attempted to implement &quot;socialism&quot; in any serious sense. Labor supported national wage fixing and a strong welfare system, it did not [[nationalisation|nationalise]] private enterprise. The single exception to this was [[Ben Chifley]]'s attempt to nationalise the private banks in the 1940s, but this was ruled unconstitutional by the [[High Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner; Macintyre (2001) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]].

From its formation until the 1950s Labor and its affiliated unions were the strongest defenders of the [[White Australia Policy]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about &quot;racial purity&quot; (shared by most Australians at this time), and partly by fears of economic competition from low-wage labour. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.

During [[World War II]], Labor leader [[John Curtin]] became Prime Minister of Australia in 1941 when independents [[crossed the floor]] to bring down the [[United Australia Party]]-[[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] Coalition Government, just weeks before the [[Fall of Singapore]]. The [[Curtin Government]] thus led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]] during which Australia came under attack from the [[Empire of Japan]]. though a monarchist and supporter of the [[British Empire]], in December 1941, Curtin announced that &quot;Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom&quot;, thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government]]). Remembered as a strong war time leader, Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by [[Ben Chifley]].&lt;ref&gt;http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chifley Government]] won the 1946 election and oversaw Australia's initial transition to a peace-time economy. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifely sought to define the labour movement as having:&lt;ref&gt;http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/in-office.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|[A] great objective – the light on the hill – which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind... [Labor would] bring something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happiness to the mass of the people’.
}} 

To a large extent, Chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions. With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election to [[Robert Menzies]]' Liberal-National Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/ Ben Chifley - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed [[Liberal Party of Australia]] won 55 seats and the Country Party 19 in the House of Representatives to Labor’s 47 seatsand Labor commenced a 23 year period in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/elections.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gough Whitlam]] led the Federal Labor Party back to office in 1972. The [[Whitlam Government]] lost office following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] and Dismissal, and was defeated in a landslide at the resulting [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 Australian Federal Election]]. [[Bob Hawke]] led Labor back to office in 1983 and the [[Hawke-Keating Government]] remained in power until defeated by [[John Howard]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]]. [[Kim Beazley]] led the party to the two susbequent elections as Opposition Leader and [[Mark Latham]] to the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]]. Beazley was recalled to replace Latham in 2005 and Latham split from his party with the publication of a 2005 memoir ''[[The Latham Diaries]]''. Beazley in turn was challenged by [[Kevin Rudd]] who went on to defeat John Howard at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]]. The [[Rudd Government]] concluded prior to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]] following the replacement of Rudd as leader of the Party by deputy leader [[Julia Gillard]]. The [[Gillard Government]] was commissioned to govern in a [[hung parliament]] following the 2010 election. 

Between the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] and the 2008 Western Australian state election, the party was in government nationally, as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures. This was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the ACT and the NT gained self-government.&lt;ref&gt;In 1969–1970, before the ACT and NT achieved self-government, the Liberal and National Coalition was also in power federally and in all six states. [http://elections.uwa.edu.au/ University of WA elections database]&lt;/ref&gt; The party subsequently lost power in Victoria in 2010 and suffered its worst electoral defeat in decades in the [[2011 New South Wales State Election]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/national/barry-ofarrell-smashes-labor-in-nsw-election/story-e6frfkvr-1226028779988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The ALP adopted the formal name &quot;Australian Labour Party&quot;&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; in 1908, but changed the spelling to &quot;Labor&quot; in 1912. While it is standard practice in [[Australian English]] both today and at the time to spell the word labour with a &quot;u&quot;, the party was influenced by the [[Labor history of the United States|United States labour movement]] and a prominent figure in the early history of the party, the American–born [[King O'Malley]], was successful in having the spelling &quot;modernised&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=History of the Australian Labor Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the [[labour movement]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, FG, ''Australia: A Concise Political and Social History'' (Sydney: Harcourt Brace &amp; Company 1996), p 205&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the spelling &quot;labor&quot; had been acceptable in both British and Australian English in earlier periods. (See also: [[Australian spelling|Spelling in Australian English]])

===Labor splits===
The Labor Party has suffered three major splits: 

* In 1916 over the issue of [[conscription]] during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090395b.htm Hughes, William Morris (Billy) (1862–1952)], [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], [[Australian National University|ANU]] web site&lt;/ref&gt; Labor Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] supported the introduction of [[conscription]], while the majority of his colleagues in the ALP and trade union movement opposed it. After failing to gain majority support for conscription in two national [[plebiscite]]s which bitterly divided the country in the process, Hughes and his followers were expelled from the Labor Party. He first formed the [[National Labor Party]] before forming the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in alliance with the conservatives and remained Prime Minister until 1923. At the state level [[William Holman]], also a supporter of conscription, quit the party at the same time and became Nationalist Party [[Premier of New South Wales]].
* In 1931 over economic issues revolving around how best to handle the [[Great Depression]]. The ALP was essentially split three ways, between those who believed in radical policies such as NSW Premier [[Jack Lang (Australia)|Jack Lang]], who wanted to repudiate Australia's debt to British bondholders; proto-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] such as federal Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]]; and believers in orthodox finance such as Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] and a senior minister in his government, [[Joseph Lyons]]. In 1931 Lyons left the party and joined the conservatives, forming the [[United Australia Party]] as successors to the Nationalists and becoming Prime Minister in 1932.
* The [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|1955 split]] on [[communism]]. During the 1950s the issue of communism and support for communist causes or governments caused great internal conflict in the Labor party and the trade union movement in general. From 1945 onward, staunchly [[anti-Communist]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] members (Catholics being an important traditional support base) in opposition to communist infiltration of unions, formed [[Industrial Groups]] to gain control of them, fostering intense internal conflict. After Labor's loss of the 1954 election, federal leader [[H.V. Evatt|Dr H.V. Evatt]] &quot;issued a statement attacking the Victorian ALP state executive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au:80/news/Gerard-Henderson/Paranoia-split-Labor-for-25-years/2005/04/11/1113071910309.html |title=Paranoia split Labor for 25 years – Gerard Henderson – www.smh.com.au |publisher=Smh.com.au:80 |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He blamed subversive activities of the &quot;Groupers&quot; for the defeat. After bitter public dispute many Groupers were expelled from the ALP and formed the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP) whose intellectual leader was [[B.A. Santamaria]]. The DLP was heavily influenced by [[Catholic social teaching]] and had the support of the Catholic Archbishop of [[Melbourne]], [[Daniel Mannix]]. Because of its &quot;veto with a view to reunification&quot; strategy, the DLP's preferences (see [[Australian electoral system]]) helped the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] remain in power for over two decades, but it was successfully undermined by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor Government during the 1970s, so that after 1978 the DLP was reduced to a small &quot;rump&quot; based in Victoria, which nevertheless continued to contest federal elections as the DLP (according to the parliamentary library election results for 1980 and onward).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/RB/2004-05/05rb11.pdf |title=IRS Research Brief Dec04 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, founding member [[Joseph Cook]] left the party in 1894, and went on to be [[Prime Minister of Australia]] with the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] in 1913–14.

==Policy==
The policy of the Australian Labor Party is contained in its National Platform, which is approved by delegates to Labor's National Conference, held every three years. According to the Labor Party's website, &quot;The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that &quot;Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely.&quot; While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: &quot;Labor believes in a strong role for national government — the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote.&quot; Labor &quot;will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions.&quot; The Platform and Labor &quot;believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential.&quot; For Labor, &quot;government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status.&quot; Further sections of the Platform stress Labor's support for Equality and Human Rights, Labour Rights and Democracy.

In practice, the Platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the Platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the Platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the Platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the Platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the Platform, Labor governments have sought to change the Platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the Platform.

===Early ideology===
The Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, but its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php|title= National Constitution of the ALP|author= |year= 2009|work= Official Website of the Australian Labor Party|publisher= Australian Labor Party|accessdate=2009-12-26|quote= The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The light on the hill]] is a phrase used to describe the objective of the Australian Labor Party. The phrase was coined in a 1949 conference speech by then Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]]. The party was created by, and has always been influenced to some extent by trade unionists, and its policy at any given time has been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia Policy|White Australia]] (a view held by all federal MPs at the time bar [[Bruce Smith (Australian politician)|Bruce Smith]], a [[Free Trade Party|Free Trader]]), a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;McKinlay (1981) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], [[White Australia]] and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism, as has the conservative side of Australian politics.

In the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], support for [[socialism]] grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for &quot;the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange.&quot; As a result, Labor's Federal Conference in 1922 adopted a similarly worded &quot;socialist objective,&quot; which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the &quot;[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment,&quot; which said that &quot;socialisation&quot; was desirable only when was necessary to &quot;eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McKinlay (1981) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. 

However, the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. Analysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals &quot;a band of unhappy amateurs&quot;, made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, an MD, and even a mine owner. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies – in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders. Some historically declare the party a mix of socialism, [[liberalism]], pragmatism and 'Laborism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozpolitics.info/guide/parties/alp/ |title=Australian Labor Party history – Oz Politics |publisher=Ozpolitics.info |date= |accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These commitments are deemed to place Labor closer, intellectually and historically, to the 19th century colonial liberals as the forerunners to the Labor party over the conservatives of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A593200 |title=The Ideology of the Australian Labor Party: BBC, 16 August 2001 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2001-08-16 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Labor===
Various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under [[Gough Whitlam]], resulting in what is now known as the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more [[social progressivism|socially progressive]] ideals, and [[Labor Right]], the now dominant faction that tends to be more [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and focus to a lesser extent on social issues.

The Whitlam government was the first Australian government to use the term [[economic rationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/JournalArticles97/Econrat97.html |title=Economic rationalism |first=John |last=Quiggin |year=1997 |publisher=Crossings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gough Whitlam]] Labor government from 1972 to 1975 was different to previous Labor governments, in that it pursued [[social democracy|social-democratic]] policies rather than [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] policies, a precursor to the party's current [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] position. Under the Whitlam government, [[tariff]]s across the board were cut by 25 percent after 23 years of Labor being in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/ |title=Tariff Reduction |publisher=The Whitlam Institute |work=The Whitlam Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] governments from 1983 to 1996 pursued many economic policies associated with [[economic rationalism]] and the [[Third Way (centrism)|&quot;Third Way&quot;]], such as [[floating currency|floating]] the [[Australian Dollar]] in 1983, reductions in trade [[tariff]]s, taxation reforms, changing from centralised wage-fixing to [[Enterprise Bargaining Agreement|enterprise bargaining]], the privatisation of [[Qantas]] and [[Commonwealth Bank]], and deregulating the banking system. Keating also proposed a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] in 1985, however due to its unpopularity amongst Labor as well as the electorate, was not adopted. The party also refrained from other reforms, such as wholesale labour market deregulation (e.g. [[WorkChoices]]), the eventual [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]], the privatisation of [[Telstra]] and [[welfare reform]] including &quot;[[work for the dole]]&quot;, which [[John Howard]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] were to initiate after winning office in 1996.

It is also said by a former staff member of [[Tony Blair]] that [[Labour Party (UK)|New Labour]] and Blair learnt from the Hawke government in the 1980s on how to govern when they took power in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/12/16/1197740090746.html?page=2 |title=How the British came, saw and helped Rudd – National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2007-12-16 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Labor leader [[Kevin Rudd]]'s first speech to parliament in 1998 stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challenge—the creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the `third way'. The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nation's economic and social imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Kevin | last=Rudd | title = First Speech to Parliament | publisher = [[Parliament of Australia]] | date= 11 November 1998 | url =http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/firstspeech.asp?id=83T | accessdate =2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Rudd is critical of free market economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Kevin | last=Rudd | title = What's Wrong with the Right | date= 16 November 2006 | url =http://www.kevinrudd.com/_dbase_upl/061116%20CIS.pdf

Labor has moved to the right in recent times under [[Kevin Rudd]] and [[Julia Gillard]] such as the party's opposition to [[gay marriage]] and supporting a tougher approach to [[asylum seekers]] such as offshore processing.

==Structure==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}

The Australian Labor Party is a democratic and federal party, which consists of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office. The majority of trade unions in Australia are affiliated to the party, and their affiliation fees, based on the size of their memberships, makes up a large part of the party's income. The party consists of six state and two territory branches, each of which consists of local branches which any Australian resident can join, plus affiliated trade unions. Individual members pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income. Members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members only become active during election campaigns. The party has about 50,000 individual members, although this figure tends to fluctuate along with the party's electoral fortunes.

The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.

The party holds a National Conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the National Conference). The National Conference approves the party's Platform and policies, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is [[Karl Bitar]]. The most recent National Conference was held from 30 July 2009 to 1 August 2009. The next National Conference is scheduled for early December 2011. It was brought forward six months in order to have a debate on gay marriage well ahead of the next election.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/bitar-to-stay-on-as-alp-national-secretary-20101119-180ij.html Bitar to stay on as ALP national secretary], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 19 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/alp-right-rejects-proposal-20101119-180zo.html ALP Right rejects proposal], ''Brisbane Times'', 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The national Leader of the Labor Party is elected by the Labor members of the national Parliament (the [[Caucus]]), not by the conference. Until recently the national conference elected the party's National President, a largely honorary position, but since 2003 the position has rotated amongst a presidential team of three, directly elected by the party's individual members. Each member of the team serves a one-year term as National President, with the other members serving as Vice-Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/bligh-joins-alp-national-president-team-20090330-9gcd.html Bligh joins ALP national president team], ''The Age'', 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The current National President is [[Anna Bligh]], the National Vice-Presidents are [[Michael Williamson (Australian unionist)|Michael Williamson]] (President from July 2009 to July 2010) and [[Jenny McAllister]].

The Labor Party contests national, state and territory elections. In some states it also contests local government elections: in others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called pre-selection. Candidates are pre-selected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two. Labor candidates are required to sign a pledge that if elected they will always vote in Parliament in accordance with the Platform and decisions made by a vote of the Caucus. They are also sometimes required to donate a portion of their salary to the party, although this practice has declined with the introduction of public funding for political parties.

===Factions===
The Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which some party members belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (on the right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]]. Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US Alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The National Left, although it seldom openly espouses [[socialism]], favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US Alliance and is often more progressive on social issues. The factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, and there is a constantly changing pattern of factional and sub-factional alliances around particular policy issues or around particular pre-selection disputes. Frequently these alliances and disputes reflect power struggles between or within trade unions.

The trade unions are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right are the [[Australian Workers Union]] (AWU), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW) and the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA). Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), the [[Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union]] (LHMU), the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMEU), the [[Australian Services Union]] (ASU) and the [[Maritime Union of Australia]] (MUA). But these affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. The AWU and the NUW, for example, are bitter rivals and the NUW sometimes aligns itself with the left. Moreover, in some cases different branches may have different factional alignment. On some issues, such as opposition to the [[Howard Government]]'s industrial relations policy, all the unions are in agreement and work as a bloc within the party.

Pre-selections are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Pre-selections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested along factional lines. A particularly fierce pre-selection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in pre-selection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over pre-selections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Pre-selection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.

The '''[[Dodo]]''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in Chapters 2 and 3 of the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). The Dodo is a caricature of the author. A popular but unsubstantiated belief is that Dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer, and thus would accidentally introduce himself as &quot;Do-do-dodgson.&quot;

==''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''==
In this passage Lewis Carroll incorporated references to the original boating expedition of 4 July 1862 during which Alice's Adventures were first told, with [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] as herself, and the others represented by birds: the [[Lory]] was Lorina Liddell, the [[The Eaglet|Eaglet]] was Edith Liddell, the Dodo was Dodgson, and the [[Duck]] was Rev. [[Robinson Duckworth]].  In order to get dry after a swim, the Dodo proposes that everyone run a Caucus race — where the participants run in patterns of any shape, starting and leaving off whenever they like, so that everyone wins.  At the end of the race, Alice distributes [[comfits]] from her pocket to all as prizes. However this leaves no prize for herself.  The Dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket.  As she has only a [[thimble]], the Dodo requests it from her and then awards it to Alice as her prize.  The Caucus Race as depicted by Carroll is a [[satire]] on the [[politics|political]] [[caucus]] system, mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness.

==Interpretations==
===Disney animated film version===
{{Main|Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)}}
In the Disney film, the Dodo plays a much greater role in the story, and plays the role of [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat's]] in Alice's infamous growth-in-the-house scene.

===Tim Burton's ''Alice in Wonderland'' version===
{{Main|Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)}}
The Dodo, who in this adaptation of the book is named Uilleam and is portrayed by [[Michael Gough]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohjohnny.net/alice/alicenews13.html&lt;/ref&gt; bears a down of brilliant blue and is one of Alice's advisers, who also took first note of her identity as the true Alice. Mysteriously, the dodo vanishes during the final battle in the film. {{Infobox character

The '''Eaglet''' is a character appearing in Chapter 2 and 3 of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], a reference to Edith Liddell, [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]'s sister.

In this passage Lewis Carroll incorporated references to everyone present on the original boating expedition of July 4, 1862 during which Alice's Adventures were first told, with Alice as [[Alice Liddell|herself]], and the others represented by birds: the [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Lory]] was Lorina Liddell, the Eaglet was Edith Liddell, the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] was [[Lewis Carroll]], and the Duck was Rev. [[Robinson Duckworth]].

According to ''The Annotated Alice'', Carroll had originally had the characters dry off by having the Dodo lead them to a nearby house for towels. As they walked, only Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet could keep up. This was a reference to a boating outing Carroll had with the three girls and their family. It began to rain and the group left for a nearby house. Carroll and the sisters got there first, as they walked the fastest. Carroll ultimately replaced this scene in the book with the Caucus race, as he felt that it would only have been funny to the people familiar with the incident.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Albrecht von Brandenburg-Kulmbach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.]]
'''Albert Alcibiades''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht Alcibiades}}) (28 March 1522 – 8 January 1557) was a [[Margrave]] of [[Principality of Bayreuth|Brandenburg-Kulmbach]], also known as Brandenburg-Bayreuth.

Because of his bellicose nature Albert received the [[cognomen]] ''[[Alcibiades]]'' after his death; during his lifetime Albert was known as ''Bellator'' (the Warlike).

He was a member of the [[Franconia]]n branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]].

==Biography==
Albert was born at [[Ansbach]] and, having lost his father [[Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Casimir]] in 1527, he came under the guardianship of his uncle [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], a strong adherent of [[Protestantism]].

In 1541 he received [[Bayreuth]] as his share of the family lands, but, as the chief town of his principality was [[Kulmbach]], he is sometimes referred to as the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.

His restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected a small band of soldiers, he assisted Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in his [[Italian War of 1542–1546|war with France]] in 1543.

The [[Peace of Crépy]] in September 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he had won a considerable reputation, and when Charles was preparing to attack the [[Schmalkaldic League]], he took pains to win Albert's assistance.

Sharing in the attack on the [[Electorate of Saxony]], Albert was taken prisoner at [[Rochlitz]] in March 1547 by Elector [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick]] of Saxony, but was released as a result of the Emperor's victory at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] in the succeeding April.

He then followed the fortunes of his friend Elector [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice]] of Saxony, deserted Charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the Emperor by an alliance with King [[Henry II of France]].

He took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the [[Peace of Passau]] was signed in August 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in [[Franconia]].

Having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of [[Nuremberg]], he quarrelled with his supporter, the French King, and offered his services to the Emperor.

Charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to Albert's demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of [[Bishopric of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[Bishopric of Bamberg|Bamberg]]; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the Emperor on the retreat from [[Metz]] in January 1553.

When Charles left Germany a few weeks later, Albert renewed his depredations in Franconia.  These soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and Maurice of Saxony led an army against his former comrade.

The rival forces met at [[Battle of Sievershausen|Sievershausen]] on 9 July 1553, and after a combat of unusual ferocity Albert was put to flight. [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], then took command of the troops of the league, and after Albert had been placed under the imperial ban in December 1553 he was defeated by Duke Henry, and compelled to flee to France.

He there entered the service of Henry II of France and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at [[Pforzheim]] on 8 January 1557.

He is defined by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as &quot;a failure of a [[Fritz]],&quot; with &quot;features&quot; of a [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] in him, &quot;but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an Alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent&quot;.

'''Albert the Bear''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht der Bär}}) (c. 1100 – 18 November 1170) was the first [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] (as Albert I) from 1157 to his death and was briefly [[Duke of Saxony]] between 1138 and 1142.

==Life==
Albert was the only son of [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt]], and [[Eilika of Saxony|Eilika]], daughter of [[Magnus, Duke of Saxony|Magnus Billung]], [[Rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]].  He inherited the valuable estates in northern Saxony of his father in 1123, and on his mother's death, in 1142, succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of [[Billung]]. Albert was a loyal [[vassal]] of his relation, [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar I, Duke of Saxony]], from whom, about 1123, he received the Margraviate of [[Lusatia]], to the east; after Lothar became [[King of the Germans]], he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to [[Bohemia]] in 1126, when he suffered a short imprisonment.

Albert's entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. After the death of his brother-in-law, Henry II, margrave of a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon [[Northern March]], in 1128, Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked Udo, the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar.  In spite of this, he went to [[Italy]] in 1132 in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in 1134 by the investiture of the Northern March, which was again without a ruler.

Once he was firmly established in the Northern March, Albert's covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. Three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic [[Wends]], who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147 in which Albert took part; diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with the last of the Wendish princes of Brandenburg, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]] of the [[Hevelli]], Albert secured this district when the prince died in 1150. Taking the title &quot;Margrave of Brandenburg&quot;, he pressed the &quot;crusade&quot; against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157, which his heirs &amp;mdash; the [[House of Ascania]] &amp;mdash; held until the line died out in 1320.

[[Image:Adalbertus Siegel.JPG|thumb|175px|left|The seal of Albert the Bear.]]

In 1137 [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], the Hohenstaufen King of the Germans, deprived Albert's cousin and nemesis, [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, Albert was driven from Saxony, and also from his Northern march by Henry, and compelled to take refuge in south Germany. When peace was made with Henry in 1142, Albert renounced the Saxon duchy and received the Counties of [[Weimar]] and [[Orlamünde]].  It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Arch-Chamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a [[prince-elector]].

In 1158 a feud with Henry's son, [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of Saxony, was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. In 1162 Albert accompanied Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] to [[Italy]], where he distinguished himself at the storming of [[Milan]].

In 1164 Albert joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in 1169, Albert divided his territories among his six sons. He died on 13 November 1170, possibly in [[Stendal]], and was buried at [[Ballenstedt]].

==Cognomen==
Albert's personal qualities won for him the [[cognomen]] of ''the [[Bear]],'' &quot;not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since,&quot; says [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], who called Albert &quot;a restless, much-managing, wide-warring man.&quot;  He is also called by later writers &quot;the Handsome.&quot; [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did Albrecht of Bear patron of the Nazi party (NSDAP).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cranach - Albert of Hohenzollern.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Albert of Mainz.  (Portrait by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1526.)]] 
Cardinal '''Albert of Hohenzollern''' (German: ''{{Audio|De-Albrecht_von_Hohenzollern.ogg|Albrecht von Hohenzollern}}'') (28 June 1490 – 24 September 1545) was [[Prince-elector|Elector]] and [[Archbishop of Mainz]] from 1514 to 1545, and [[Archbishop of Magdeburg]] from 1513 to 1545.

==Biography==
Born in [[Cölln]], Albert was the younger son of [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg]].

After their father's death, Albert and his older brother [[Joachim I Nestor]] became [[Margrave of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] in 1499, but only his older brother held the title of an [[elector of Brandenburg]]. Having studied at the university of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], Albert entered the ecclesiastical profession, and in 1513 became [[archbishop]] of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] at the age of 23 and administrator of the [[Diocese of Halberstadt]].  

In 1514 he obtained the [[Electorate of Mainz]], and in 1518 was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] at the age of 28.  Meanwhile to pay for the [[pallium]] of the [[Holy See|see of Mainz]] and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 [[ducat]]s  from [[Jacob Fugger]], and had obtained permission from [[Pope Leo X]] to conduct the sale of [[indulgences]] in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as half the collection was forwarded to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinal's retinue in charge of the cashbox.  For this work he procured the services of [[John Tetzel]], and so indirectly exercised a potent influence on the course of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

It was as a disgusted response to Tetzel's activities selling indulgences that [[Martin Luther]] wrote his famous [[95 Theses]], which he sent to Albert on 31 October 1517 and traditionally nailed to the door of Castle Church in [[Wittenberg]]. Albert forwarded the theses to Rome, suspecting them of heresy. 

When the imperial election of 1519 drew near, the elector's vote was eagerly solicited by the partisans of Charles (afterwards the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]) and by those of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], King of France, and he appears to have received a large amount of money for the vote, which he cast eventually for Charles.  

[[Image:CranachBrandenburgasJerome.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cardinal Albert, Archbishop of Mainz and portrait by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1526.]] Albert's large and liberal ideas, his friendship with [[Ulrich von Hutten]], and his political ambitions, appear to have raised hopes that he would be won over to [[Protestantism]]; but after the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525 he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and was among the princes who met to concert measures for its defence at [[Dessau]] in July 1525.  
[[Image:Saint maurice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Meeting of Saint [[Erasmus of Formiae]] and [[Saint Maurice]]'' by [[Matthias Grünewald]] (1517–1523), [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]. Grünewald used Albert of Mainz, who commissioned the painting, as the model for St. Erasmus (left).]]
His hostility towards the reformers, however, was not so extreme as that of his brother Joachim I, Elector of  Brandenburg; and he appears to have exerted himself in the  interests of peace, although he was a member of the [[League of Nuremberg]], which was formed in 1538 as a counterpoise to the [[League of Schmalkalden]].  

The new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 [[German florin|florin]]s.  During his latter years indeed he showed more intolerance towards the Protestants, and favoured the teaching of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in his dominions.  

Albert adorned the [[collegiate church]] (''Stiftskirche'')  at [[Halle (Saale)]] and the [[Mainz Cathedral|cathedral at Mainz]] in sumptuous fashion, and took as his motto the words ''Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae'' (Latin for: &quot;Lord, I admired the adornment of your house.&quot;). A generous patron of art and learning, he counted [[Erasmus]] among his friends.  

He died at [[Aschaffenburg]] in 1545.

[[Image:Albrecht von Hohenzollern.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Albert of Prussia]]

'''Albert of Prussia''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht}}; {{lang-la|Albertus}}) (8 July 1490 – 20 March 1568) was the 37th [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Knights]] and, after converting to [[Lutheranism]], the first [[duke]] of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], which was the first state to adopt the Lutheran faith and [[Protestantism]] as the official [[state religion]]. Albert proved instrumental in the political spread of [[Protestantism]] in its early stage.

Because Albert was a member of the [[Principality of Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]] branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], it had been hoped that his election as Grand Master would reverse the decline of the Teutonic Knights since 1410; [[Duke Frederick of Saxony]] of the [[House of Wettin]] had been elected for the same reason. Instead, Albert's [[secularization]] of the [[Prussia (region)|Prussian territories]] of the Order eventually led to the inheritance of the Duchy of Prussia by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].

Albert's titles (on his proclamation of 1561 in [[Königsberg]]) were: ''Albert the Elder, Margrave of Brandenburg in Prussia, [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in [[Pomerania]], Duke of the [[Kashubians]], and [[Wends]], [[Burgrave of Nuremberg]], and Count of [[Rügen]] etc.''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Early life==
Albert was born in [[Ansbach]] in [[Franconia]] as the third son of [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. His mother was [[Sophia of Poland|Sophia]], daughter of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]], and his wife [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]]. He was raised for a career in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and spent some time at the court of [[Hermann IV of Hesse]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]], who appointed him canon of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].
Despite being quite religious, he was also interested in mathematics and science, and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the Church in favour of scientific theories. His career was forwarded by the Church however and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advance.

Turning to a more active life, Albert accompanied Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to [[Italy]] in 1508, and after his return spent some time in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

==Grand Master==
[[Image:Albrecht von Hohenzollern-Ansbach.jpg|thumb|200px|right|As Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Statue by [[Rudolf Siemering]] (1835 Königsberg - 1905 Berlin)]]
[[Duke Frederick of Saxony]], Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]], died in December 1510. Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old]], Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia, which had been held by the Order under Polish [[suzerainty]] since the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]].

The new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland. As war over the Order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with Emperor Maximilian I. The ill-feeling, influenced by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland, culminated in [[Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521)|a war]] which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia. Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521.

The dispute was referred to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and other princes, but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war. For this purpose he visited the [[Diet of Nuremberg]] in 1522, where he made the acquaintance of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]] [[Andreas Osiander]], by whose influence Albert was won over to [[Protestantism]].

The Grand Master then journeyed to [[Wittenberg]], where he was advised by [[Martin Luther]] to abandon the rules of his Order, to marry, and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself. This proposal, which was understandably appealing to Albert, had already been discussed by some of his relatives; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously, and he assured [[Pope Adrian VI]] that he was anxious to reform the Order and punish the knights who had adopted [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] doctrines. Luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion, but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians, while Albert's brother, Margrave [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], laid the scheme before their uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland.

==Duke of Prussia==
[[Image:Prussian Homage.jpg|400px|right|thumb|“[[Prussian Tribute|The Prussian Tribute]]“: Albert and his brothers receive the [[Duchy of Prussia]] as a [[fief]] from  Polish King [[Sigismund I the Old]], 1525. [[History painting|Painting]] by [[Jan Matejko|Matejko]], 1882.]]
After some delay Sigismund assented to the offer, with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a [[Treaty of Kraków|treaty concluded at Kraków]], Albert pledged a [[Prussian Homage|personal oath]] to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525.

The [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] of the land then met at [[Königsberg]] and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke, who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther. This transition did not, however, take place without protest. Summoned before the imperial court of justice, Albert refused to appear and was proscribed, while the Order elected a new Grand Master, [[Walter von Cronberg]], who received Prussia as a fief at the imperial [[Diet of Augsburg]]. As the German princes were experiencing the tumult of the Reformation, the [[German Peasants' War]], and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars against the Ottoman Turks]], they did not enforce the ban on the duke, and agitation against him soon died away.

In imperial politics Albert was fairly active. Joining the [[League of Torgau]] in 1526, he acted in unison with the Protestants, and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the [[Augsburg Interim]] in May 1548. For various reasons, however, poverty and personal inclination among others, he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period.

The early years of Albert's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court. He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life. In 1544, in spite of some opposition, he founded [[Königsberg University]], where he appointed his friend Andreas Osiander to a professorship in 1549. Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical &quot;[[Prutenic Tables]]&quot; compiled by [[Erasmus Reinhold]] and the first maps of Prussia by [[Caspar Hennenberger]].

[[Image:Albrecht von Brandenburg-Preußen Groschen.jpg|right|thumb|281px|1 [[Groschen]] coin, 1534, ''[[Epistle to the Galatians|Iustus ex fide vivit]] — The Just lives on Faith'']]

This step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert's reign. Osiander's divergence from Luther's doctrine of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with [[Philip Melanchthon]], who had adherents in Königsberg, and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town. The duke strenuously supported Osiander, and the area of the quarrel soon broadened. There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles, the burden of taxation was heavy, and Albert's rule became unpopular.

After Osiander's death in 1552, Albert favoured a preacher named [[Johann Funck]], who, with an adventurer named [[Paul Skalić]], exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense. The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of Albert's early death and the need, should that happen, to appoint a [[regent]], as his only son, [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] was still a mere youth. The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander, and the climax came in 1566 when the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] appealed to King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of Poland, Albert's cousin, who sent a commission to Königsberg. Scalich saved his life by flight, but Funck was executed. The question of the regency was settled, and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers.

Virtually deprived of power, the duke lived for two more years, and died at [[Gvardeysk|Tapiau]] on 20 March 1568.

Albert was a voluminous letter writer, and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time.

==Legacy==
Although Albert has received relatively little recognition in German history, his dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia (and also the Hohernzollern dynasty), which would eventually become arguably the most powerful German state and instrumental in uniting the whole of Germany. Albert is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation, and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany.
He was a skilled political administrator and leader, and effectively reversed the decline of the Teutonic Order, until he betrayed it by transforming the order's lands into his own duchy, secularizing it in the process. 

He was the first German noble to support Luther's ideas and in 1544 founded the University of Königsberg (the so called [[Albertina]]) as a rival to the Roman Catholic [[Cracow Academy]]; it was only the second Lutheran university in the German states, after [[Marburg]].

In 1891, a statue was erected to his memory in [[Königsberg]].

==Spouse and Issue==
Albert married first, to Princess [[Dorothea of Denmark (1504-1547)|Dorothea]] (1 August 1504-11 April 1547), daughter of King [[Frederick I of Denmark]], in 1526. They had six children;

*Anna Sofie (1527–1591)
*Katharina (b. &amp; d. 1528)
*Friedrich Albrecht (1529–1530)
*Lucia Dorothea (1531–1532)
*Lucia (1537–1539)
*Albrecht (1539-1539)

He married secondly to Anna Maria (1532–20 March 1568), daughter of [[Eric I of Brunswick|Eric I]], Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]], in 1550. The couple had two children;

*Elisabeth (1551–1596)
*[[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albrecht Friedrich]] (1553–1618)

'''Aachen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaːxən|-|De-Aachen-2.ogg}}, also known in English by its [[French language|French]] name '''Aix-la-Chapelle''') has historically been a [[spa town]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. Aachen was a favoured residence of [[Charlemagne]], and the place of coronation of the [[List of German monarchs|Kings of Germany]]. Geographically, Aachen is the westernmost town of Germany, located along its borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], {{convert|65|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name=CVDE&gt;Bridgwater, W. &amp; Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[RWTH Aachen University]], one of [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]], is located in the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;RWTH&quot; is the abbreviation of &quot;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule&quot;, which translates into &quot;Rhine-Westphalian Technical University&quot;. The institution is commonly referred to as &quot;RWTH Aachen&quot; or simply &quot;RWTH&quot;, with the abbreviation remaining untranslated in other languages to avoid the use of the &quot;Hochschule&quot; term, which is sometimes mistakenly translated as [[Highschool#United States|highschool]]. Sometimes, RWTH Aachen is also referred to as &quot;TH Aachen&quot; or &quot;Aachen University&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;''Note:'' The term &quot;FH Aachen&quot; does not refer to the RWTH but to the [[Fachhochschule Aachen]], a [[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]], which is also located in Aachen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rwth-aachen.de&quot;&gt;[http://www.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaabdzfc 2007 statistics of RWTH Aachen University]''(German; retrieved 2009-04-09)''&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's predominant economic focus is on science, engineering, information technology and related sectors. For innovation, Aachen is currently ranked 8th among cities in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovation-cities.com/2thinknow-innovation-cities-global-256-index/ Innovation Cities Index 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Aachen1566.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Medieval architecture can be found in Aachen.]]
A quarry on the Lousberg, which was first used in [[Neolithic]] times, attests to the long occupation of the site of Aachen.

No larger settlements, however, have been found to have existed in this remote rural area, distant at least 15&amp;nbsp;km from the nearest road even in Roman times, up to the early medieval period when the place is mentioned as a king's mansion for the first time, not long before [[Charlemagne]] became ruler of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]].

Since [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, the hot springs at Aachen have been channeled into baths.&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; There are currently two places to &quot;take the waters&quot;, at the [[Carolus Thermen]] complex and the bathhouse in [[Burtscheid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bad-aachen.de/Deutsch/gebiete.htm Spa districts in Aachen (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some documentary proof that the Romans named the [[hot spring|hot sulfur springs]] of Aachen ''Aquis-Granum'', and indeed to this day the city is known in [[Italian language|Italian]] as Aquisgrana, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as Aquisgrán and in Polish as Akwizgran. The name ''Granus'' has lately been identified as that of [[Grannus|a Celtic deity]].

In [[French language|French-speaking]] areas of the former [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], the word ''aquis'' evolved into the modern ''Aix''.

===The Middle Ages===
[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]].]]

After Roman times, [[Einhard]] mentions that in 765–6 [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Younger]] spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' (&quot;{{lang|la|Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.}}&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noctes-gallicanae.org/Charlemagne/Annales/Pepin_le_Bref.htm Pépin le Bref], ''Annales d'Éginhard''&lt;/ref&gt; which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as King of Franks, 768, [[Charlemagne]] came to spend [[Christmas]] at Aachen for the first time. He went on to remain there in a [[Palace of Aachen|mansion]] which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] (since 1929, cathedral) and the palatial presentation halls. Charlemagne spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in Aachen, which became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never very widely acknowledged outside the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|bishopric of Liège]] where he may still be venerated by tradition.&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt;

In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned king of the kingdom in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. Over the next 500 years, most kings of Germany destined to reign over the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned &quot;[[List of German monarchs|King of the Germans]]&quot; in Aachen. The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to [[Flanders]], achieving a modest position in the trade in [[wool]]len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]], subject to the Emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the &quot;Aachener Reich&quot;. Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of Jülich|duke of Jülich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

From the early 16th century, Aachen lost power. A fire devastated the city in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003197 &quot;Aachen&quot;]. (2006). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved 9 December 2006, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen became attractive as a spa by the middle of the 17th century, not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because Aachen was then — and remained well into the 19th century — a place of high-level [[prostitution]] in Europe. Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history is found in the 18th century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas; the main indication for visiting patients, ironically, was [[syphilis]]; only by the end of the 19th century had rheuma become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid. This explains why Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as ''Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle'' in [[English language|English]]) in 1668, leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]]. The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, finishing the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818 to decide the fate of occupied [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic France.

===The nineteenth century===
By the middle of the 19th century, industrialization swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt remains of the city's mediæval constitution was kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'') until 1801, when Aachen became the &quot;[[Prefectures in France|chef-lieu]] du [[Roer (department)|département de la Roer]]&quot; in Napoléon's [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] took over and the city became one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; Administered within the [[Rhine Province]], by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1840, the [[rail transport|railway]] from [[Cologne]] to [[Belgium]] passed through Aachen. The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions up to 1875 when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building operations and new, less miserable quarters were built in the eastern part of the city, where drainage of waste liquids was easiest. In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important for the production of railway locomotives and carriages, [[iron]], [[pin]]s, [[sewing needle|needles]], [[button]]s, [[tobacco]], woollen goods, and [[silk]] goods.

===The twentieth century===
Aachen was heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. The [[Battle of Aachen]] occurred between 2–21 October 1944 and Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies. The city was destroyed partially — and in some parts completely — during the fighting,&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; mostly by [[United States Army|American]] [[artillery]] fire and demolitions carried out by the [[Waffen-SS]] defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of [[Foillan|St. Foillan]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], and the [[Rathaus]] (city hall), although [[Aachen Cathedral]] was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was murdered by an SS commando unit.

While the [[Palace of Aachen|emperor's palace]] no longer exists, the church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aachen.de/EN/ts/140_museums/140_90.html Cathedral of Aachen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

[[Aachen Cathedral]] was erected on the orders of [[Charlemagne]] in AD 786 and was on completion the largest cathedral north of the [[Alps]]. On his death Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles.

The 14th century city hall lies between two central places, the ''Markt'' (market place) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist Alfre Rethel which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature.

The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the Markt, is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosts the city archive. The Grashaus was the former city hall before the present building took over this function.

The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in south-eastern direction lies the 19th century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].

Also well-known and well worth seeing are the two remaining city gates, the ''Ponttor'', one half mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Kleinmarschiertor'', close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

There are many other places and objects worth seeing, for example a notable number of [[church (building)|church]]es and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular Baroque style typical of the region, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, amongst others. The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early twentieth-century manufacturing sites in the city.

==Economy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
[[File:Aachen Ford-Entwicklungszentrum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] Research Center, Aachen.]]
Aachen has a large number of spin-offs from the university's IT-technology department and is a major centre of IT development in Germany. Due to the low level of investment in cross-border railway projects, the city has preserved a slot within the [[Thalys]] high-speed train network which uses existing tracks on its last 70&amp;nbsp;km from Belgium to Cologne.
The airport that serves Aachen, [[Maastricht Aachen Airport]], is located about 40&amp;nbsp;km away in Dutch territory, close to the town of Beek.
Aachen was the administrative centre for the coal-mining industries in neighbouring places to the northeast; it never played any role in [[Lignite|brown coal]] mining, however, neither in administrative or industrial terms.
Products manufactured in or around Aachen include electronics, chemicals, plastics, textiles, glass, cosmetics, and needles and pins. Its most important source of revenue, the textile industries, have been dead for almost half a century now.

==Transport==
Aachen's [[Train station|railway station]], the [[Aachen Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]], was constructed in 1841 at the [[Cologne-Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne-Aachen railway line]] and replaced in 1905, moving it significantly closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Mönchengladbach]] and [[Liège]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from [[Paris]] to Cologne also stop at Aachen Hauptbahnhof. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and one [[Regionalbahn|RB]] line connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Liège, [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''euregiobahn'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.
There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''Aachen West'', ''Aachen-Schanz'', ''Aachen-Rothe Erde'' and ''Eilendorf''. Only slower trains stop at these, but Aachen-West has developed enormous importance due to the expanding [[RWTH Aachen]] university.

Aachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (West-East), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (North-South) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). Due to the enormous amount of traffic at the Aachen road interchange, there is often serious traffic accumulation, which is why there are plans to expand the interchange in the coming years.

The nearest airports are [[Düsseldorf International Airport]] (80&amp;nbsp;km), [[Cologne Bonn Airport]] (90&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] (40&amp;nbsp;km).

==Sports==
The annual CHIO (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen was also the host of the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].

The local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run-out in Germany's [[Fußball-Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the second division.
The stadium &quot;Tivoli&quot;, opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division. Today, the stadium is used by the amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club holds its games in the new stadium &quot;Neuer Tivoli&quot; - meaning New Tivoli- a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32.960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.

In the South of the city you can find Aachen's biggest tennis club &quot;TC Grün Weiss&quot;, which hosts the famous ATP Tournament once a year.

==Awards==
Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the [[Karlspreis]] (German for ‘Charlemagne Award’) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to the President of the United States, [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to cooperation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and human rights in Europe, and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2003 the medal was awarded to [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an ‘Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal’, which was awarded for the first time ever.

==Miscellaneous==
{{trivia|date=January 2011}}
[[File:CarolusThermen01.JPG|thumb|200px|left|upright|In the Carolus Thermen named for [[Charlemagne]].]]
For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens.
[[File:Aachen Rosenmontag 2009.jpg|thumb|Aachen is also famous for its [[carnival]] (Karneval, Fasching), in which families dress in colorful costumes.]]
In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an [[Anno Domini]] date on a general circulation [[coin]], a [[groschen]]. It was written MCCCLXXII. None with this date are known to exist any longer. The earliest date for which an Aachen coin still exists is dated 1373.
[[File:Mies van der Rohe - Wohnhaus II.JPG|thumb|House of the family of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]].]]
King [[Æthelwulf of Wessex|Ethelwulf of Wessex]], father of [[Alfred the Great]] was born in Aachen.
Ludwig [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]], one of the founders of [[modern architecture]] and the last director of the [[Bauhaus]] during its period in [[Dessau]] and [[Berlin]] was born in Aachen as well.

Aachen has the [[hot spring|hottest springs]] of [[Central Europe]] with water temperatures of 74[[Celsius|°C]](165[[Fahrenheit|°F]]). The water contains a considerable percentage of [[Sodium chloride|common salt]] and other [[salt|sodium salts]] and [[sulfur|sulphur]].

In 1850 [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Reuter]] founded the [[Reuters]] News Agency in Aachen which transferred messages between Brussels and Aachen using [[carrier pigeon]]s.

The [[Scotch-Club]] in Aachen was the first [[discothèque]] since October 19, 1959. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.

The local specialty of Aachen is an originally stonehard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called ''[[Aachener Printen]]''. Unlike [[gingerbread]] (''{{lang-de|[[Lebkuchen]]}}''), which is sweetened with honey, ''Printen'' are sweetened with sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.

Aachen is at the western end of the [[Benrath line]] that divides [[High German languages|High German]] to the south from the rest of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] speech area to the north.

As a spa city, Aachen could use the title ''Bad Aachen'', but as the town then would not then appear in first place on alphabetically ordered lists, it declined to do so.

==Education==
[[File:Aachen RWTH Hauptgebaeude.jpg|thumb|The main building of RWTH Aachen University|right]]
[[File:Aachen-ElegantStreet.JPG|thumb|Typical Aachen street with early twentieth century [[Gründerzeit]] houses|right]]
[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinics attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xfem2009.rwth-aachen.de/MainContents/AboutAachen.php|title=About Aachen|publisher=Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science (AICES) at RWTH Aachen University|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).

[[FH Aachen]], [[Aachen University of Applied Sciences (AcUAS)]] was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions like Mechatronics, Construction Engineering, Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programs and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or Doppeldiplome (double degrees). Foreign students accounts for more than 21% of the student body.

The [[German Army]]'s Technical School (''Technische Schule des Heeres und Fachschule des Heeres für Technik'') is in Aachen.

'''Agate''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|ɡ|ə|t}}) is a [[microcrystalline]] variety of [[silica]], chiefly [[chalcedony]], characterised by its fineness of grain and brightness of color. Although agates may be found in various kinds of rock, they are classically associated with [[volcanic]] rocks and can be common in certain [[metamorphic rocks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wilder&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology and history==
The stone was given its name by [[Theophrastus]], a Greek philosopher and naturalist, who discovered the stone along the shore line of the river Achates ({{lang-el|Ἀχάτης}}) sometime between the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2318659 Achates], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  Colorful agates and other [[chalcedony|chalcedonies]] were obtained over 3,000 years ago from the Achates River, now called [[Dirillo]], in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ancient use===
Agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of [[hardstone carving]], and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites, indicating its widespread use in the ancient world; for example, archaeological recovery at the [[Knossos]] site on [[Crete]] illustrates its role in [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2007. [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation and characteristics ==
[[File:Agatebots.jpg|thumb|left|Faceted Botswana agate]]
Most agates occur as [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] in [[volcanic]] rocks or ancient [[lava]]s where they represent cavities originally produced by the disengagement of [[volatiles]] in the molten mass which were then filled, wholly or partially, by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls. Such agates, when cut transversely, exhibit a succession of parallel lines, often of extreme tenuity, giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as banded agate, riband agate and striped agate.

In the formation of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing [[silica]] in solution—derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself—percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous coating on the interior of the vapour-vesicles. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of chalcedony often alternate with layers of crystalline [[quartz]]. Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is still [[Viscosity|viscous]], and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a [[Brazil]]ian [[geode]] lined with [[amethyst]] and weighing 35&amp;nbsp;tons was exhibited at the [[Düsseldorf Exhibition]] of 1902. Perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by Moxon cited below.

The first deposit on the wall of a cavity, forming the &quot;skin&quot; of the agate, is generally a dark greenish mineral substance, like [[celadonite]], [[delessite]] or &quot;[[green earth]]&quot;, which are rich in [[iron]] probably derived from the decomposition of the [[augite]] in the enclosing volcanic rock. This green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown [[iron oxide]] ([[limonite]]), producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate-nodule. The outer [[surface]] of an agate, freed from its matrix, is often pitted and rough, apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating. The first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the &quot;priming&quot;, and upon this base zeolitic minerals may be deposited.

Many agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of quartz, often amethyst, having the apices of the [[crystal]]s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity, or geode.

On the disintegration of the matrix in which the agates are embedded, they are set free. The agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the [[soil]] or are deposited as [[gravel]] in streams and shorelines.

== Types of agate ==

}}
A Mexican agate, showing only a single eye, has received the name of ''cyclops agate.'' Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or [[moss agate]]. ''Dendritic'' agates have fern like patterns in them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance.

'''Turritella agate''' is formed from silicified [[fossil]] ''[[Elimia tenera]]'' (erroneously considered ''[[Turritella]]'') shells. ''E. tenera'' are spiral marine [[gastropod]]s having elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, [[coral]], [[petrified wood]] and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized. Agatized coral is often referred to as [[Petoskey stone]] or agate.

Greek agate is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in Sicily back to 400 B.C. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads. Even though the stone had been around centuries and was known to both the Sumerians and the Egyptians, both who used the gem for decoration and for playing important parts in their religious ceremonies, any agate of this color from Sicily, once an ancient Greek colony, is called Greek agate.

Another type of agate is Brazilian agate, which is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.

Certain stones, when examined in [[thin section]]s by transmitted light, show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed ''rainbow agates''. Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.

Other forms of agate include [[Lake Superior agate]], carnelian agate (usually exhibiting reddish hues), Botswana agate, [[Ellensburg blue agate]], blue lace agate, plume agates, tube agate (with visible flow channels), fortification agate (which exhibit little or no layered structure), ''fire agate'' (which seems to glow internally like an opal) and Mexican crazy-lace agate (which exhibits an often brightly colored, complex banded pattern) also called Rodeo Agate and Rosetta Stone depending on who owned the mine at the time.

== Uses in industry and art ==
Industry uses agates chiefly to make ornaments such as pins, brooches, paper knives, inkstands, marbles and seals. Because of its hardness and ability to resist acids, agate is used to make mortars and pestles to crush and mix chemicals. Because of the high polish possible with agate it has been used for centuries for [[leather burnishing]] tools. [[Idar-Oberstein]] was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farlang.com/art/2007-04-15.7721093142 Background Article on Idar Oberstein]&lt;/ref&gt; Agates have long been used in arts and crafts. The sanctuary of a Presbyterian church in [[Yachats, Oregon]], has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yachatspresbyterian.org/webapp/GetPage?pid=211&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aspirin''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), also known as '''acetylsalicylic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˌ|s|ɛ|t|əl|ˌ|s|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ɨ|k}} {{respell|ə|SET|əl-sal-i|SIL|ik}}; abbreviated '''ASA'''), is a [[salicylate]] [[medication|drug]], often used as an [[analgesic]] to relieve minor aches and pains, as an [[antipyretic]] to reduce [[fever]], and as an [[anti-inflammatory]] medication.

[[Salicylic acid]], the main metabolite of aspirin, is an integral part of human and animal metabolism. While much of it is attributable to diet, a substantial part is synthesized endogenously.&lt;ref name=Paterson_2008&gt;{{cite pmid|19053387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin also has an [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] effect by inhibiting the production of [[thromboxane]], which under normal circumstances binds [[platelet]] molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, and [[thrombus|blood clot]] formation in people at high risk for developing blood clots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJM198308183090703| issn = 00284793| volume = 309| issue = 7| pages = 396–403| last = Lewis| first = H D

The main [[adverse drug reaction|undesirable side effects]] of aspirin are [[gastrointestinal]] [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]], stomach bleeding, and [[tinnitus]], especially in higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer used to control [[flu-like symptoms]] or the symptoms of [[chickenpox]] or other viral illnesses, because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ2002-Macdonald&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Macdonald S|title=Aspirin use to be banned in under 16 year olds|journal=BMJ|volume=325|issue=7371|page=988|year=2002|pmid= 12411346 |pmc=1169585|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7371.988/c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin is part of a group of medication called [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs).  Though it, and other in its group called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) and inhibit the same enzyme [[cyclooxygenase]] as their mechanism of action, they do so in a irreversible manner (see NSAID [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs#Mechanism of action|mechanism of action]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman and Gilman's&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Burke| first = Anne|last2=Smyth|first2=Emer|last3=FitzGerald|first3=Garret A.| title = Chapter 26: Analgesic Antipyretic and Antiinflammatory Agents in Goodman and Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therpeutics.| publisher = McGraw-Hill| year = 2006|location = New York| pages = 671–716| url = http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=942410&amp;searchStr=aspirin| isbn = 0071422803}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, NSAIDs antiplatelet effects last in the order of hours, whereas aspirin's effect lasts for days (until the body replaces the suppressed platelets).  Hence, when physicians tell patients to stop taking NSAIDs, they usually imply aspirin as well.

Today, aspirin is one of the most widely used medications in the world, with an estimated 40,000 [[tonnes]] of it being consumed each year.&lt;ref name='cox3article'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3): filling in the gaps toward a COX continuum?|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=2002|coauthors=Warner TD, Mitchell JA.|volume=99|issue=21|pages=13371–3|pmid=12374850 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/extract/99/21/13371|doi=10.1073/pnas.222543099|author=Warner, T. D.|pmc=129677}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where ''Aspirin'' is a registered [[trademark]] owned by [[Bayer]], the generic term is ''acetylsalicylic acid'' (ASA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordconstructions.com/articles/health/aspirin.html |title=The use of aspirin|publisher=Wordconstructions.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Aspirin is used for the treatment of a number of conditions including: [[fever]], pain, [[rheumatic fever]], inflammatory diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[pericarditis]], and [[Kawasaki disease]].&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt; It is used in the prevention of [[transient ischemic attack]]s, [[stroke]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], pregnancy loss, and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspirin|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/aspirin.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===
In general, aspirin works well for dull, throbbing pain; it is ineffective for pain caused by most muscle [[cramp]]s, [[bloating]], [[gastric distension]] and acute skin irritation.&lt;ref name=pmid14592563&gt;{{Cite pmid|14592563}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most studied example is pain after surgery, such as tooth extraction, for which the highest allowed dose of aspirin (1 g) is equivalent to 1 g of paracetamol, 60&amp;nbsp;mg of [[codeine]] and 5&amp;nbsp;mg of [[oxycodone]]. A combination of aspirin and [[caffeine]], generally, affords greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent aspirin alleviates pain much faster than aspirin in tablets (15–30 min vs. 45–60 min).&lt;ref name=pmid10868553&gt;{{Cite pmid|10868553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as a postsurgery painkiller, aspirin is inferior to ibuprofen and has higher gastrointestinal toxicity. The maximum dose of aspirin (1 g) provides weaker pain relief than an intermediate dose of ibuprofen (400&amp;nbsp;mg), and this relief does not last as long.&lt;ref name=pmid10868553/&gt; A combination of aspirin and codeine may have a slightly higher analgesic effect than aspirin alone; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful.&lt;ref name=pmid9373807&gt;{{Cite pmid|9373807}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears ibuprofen is at least equally, and possibly more, effective than this combination.&lt;ref name=pmid6763202&gt;{{Cite pmid|6763202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a meta-analysis of clinical trials for [[dysmenorrhea|menstrual pain]], aspirin demonstrated higher efficacy than placebo, but lower than ibuprofen or [[naproxen]], although maximum doses of aspirin were never used in these trials. The authors concluded ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio.&lt;ref name=pmid9692420&gt;{{Cite pmid|9692420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin did not ease pain during cycling exercise,&lt;ref name=pmid9268956&gt;{{Cite pmid|9268956}}&lt;/ref&gt; while caffeine, surprisingly, was very effective.&lt;ref name=pmid18458355&gt;{{Cite pmid|18458355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid14622688&gt;{{Cite pmid|14622688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, aspirin, codeine or paracetamol were not better than placebo for muscle soreness after exercise.&lt;ref name=pmid10896014&gt;{{Cite pmid|10896014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention of heart attacks and strokes===
There are two distinct uses of aspirin for prophylaxis of cardiovascular events: primary prevention and secondary prevention. Primary prevention is about decreasing [[stroke]]s and [[heart attack]]s in the general population of those who have no diagnosed heart or [[vascular]] problems. Secondary prevention concerns patients with known [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Baigent C, Blackwell L, Collins R, ''et al.'' |title=Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9678 |pages=1849–60 |year=2009 |pmid=19482214 |pmc=2715005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60503-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low doses of aspirin are recommended for the secondary prevention of strokes and heart attacks. For both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and [[Ischaemic stroke|ischaemic stroke]] by about a fifth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Although aspirin also raises the risk of [[Hemorrhagic stroke|hemorrhagic stroke]] and other major [[bleeding|bleeds]] by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive. Thus, in secondary prevention trials, aspirin reduced the overall mortality by about a tenth.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;/&gt;

For persons without cardiovascular problems, the benefits of aspirin are unclear. In the primary prevention trials, aspirin decreased the overall incidence of heart attacks and ischaemic strokes by about a tenth. However, since these events were rare, the absolute reduction of their rate was low: from 0.57% to 0.51% per year. In addition, the risks of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding almost completely offset the benefits of aspirin. Thus, in the primary prevention trials, aspirin did not change the overall mortality rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;/&gt; Further trials {{As of|2010|alt=are in progress}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;/&gt;

The expert bodies diverge in their opinions regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention, such as can be accomplished by including aspirin in a [[polypill]] for the general population. The US Government Preventive Services Task Force recommended making individual, case by case choices based on the estimated future risk and patients' preferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19293073&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wolff T, Miller T, Ko S |title=Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=150 |issue=6 |pages=405–10 |year=2009 |pmid=19293073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19293072&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=150 |issue=6 |pages=396–404 |year=2009 |pmid=19293072 |author1= US Preventive Services Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration argued such recommendations are unjustified, since the relative reduction of risk in the primary prevention trials of aspirin was same for persons in high- and low-risk groups and did not depend on the blood pressure. The Collaboration suggested [[statin]]s as the alternative and more effective preventive medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;/&gt;

===Coronary and carotid arteries, bypasses and stents===
The [[coronary arteries]] supply [[blood]] to the [[heart]]. Aspirin is recommended for one to six months after placement of [[stent]]s in the coronary arteries and for years after a [[coronary artery bypass graft]].

The [[carotid arteries]] supply blood to the [[Human brain|brain]]. Patients with mild [[carotid artery stenosis]] benefit from aspirin; it is recommended after a [[carotid endarterectomy]] or carotid artery stent.

After [[vascular surgery]] of the lower legs using artificial [[medical grafting|grafts]] which are [[surgical suture|sutured]] to the arteries to improve blood supply, aspirin is used to keep the grafts open.

===Other uses===
Although aspirin has been used to combat fever and pains associated with [[common cold]] for more than 100 years, only recently its efficacy was confirmed in controlled clinical trials on adults. One gram of aspirin, on average, reduced the oral body temperature from {{convert|39.0|C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|37.6|C|abbr=on}} after three hours. The relief began after 30 minutes, and after six hours, the temperature still remained below {{convert|37.8|C|abbr=on}}. Aspirin also helped with &quot;achiness&quot;, discomfort and headache,&lt;ref name=pmid16154478&gt;{{Cite pmid|16154478}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with sore throat pain, for those who had it.&lt;ref name=pmid12873261&gt;{{Cite pmid|12873261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin was indistinguishable from paracetamol in any respect, except for, possibly, slightly higher rate of sweating and gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;ref name=pmid16154478/&gt;

Fever and joint pain of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]] respond extremely well, often within three days, to high doses of aspirin. The therapy usually lasts for one to two weeks; and only in about 5% of the cases it has to continue for longer than six months. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin treatment is unnecessary, as it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.&lt;ref name=NHFA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf|title=Diagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia.

Along with rheumatic fever, [[Kawasaki disease]] remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children, although even this use has been questioned by some authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15545617&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hsieh KS, Weng KP, Lin CC, Huang TC, Lee CL, Huang SM |title=Treatment of acute Kawasaki disease: aspirin's role in the febrile stage revisited |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=6 |pages=e689–93 |year=2004 |pmid=15545617 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1037 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15545617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the only indications for aspirin use in children and adolescents under 16 are Kawasaki disease and prevention of blood clot formation.

Taking aspirin before [[air travel]] in cramped conditions has been suggested to decrease the risk of [[deep-vein thrombosis]] (DVT). The reason for taking aspirin is the long period of sitting without exercise, not air travel itself. A large, randomized, controlled trial in 2000 of aspirin against placebo in 13,000 patients with hip fractures found &quot;a 29% relative risk reduction in DVT with 160 mg of aspirin taken daily for five weeks. Although there are obvious problems with extrapolating the data to long-distance travelers, this is the best evidence we could find to justify aspirin use&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/441153 |title=Loke and Dery: Air Travel and Venous Thrombosis: How Much Help Might Aspirin Be? 2002 |publisher=Medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 article published by the Journal of Clinical Investigation suggested that aspirin might prevent liver damage. In their experiment, scientists from [[Yale University]] and The [[University of Iowa]] induced damage in certain liver cells ([[hepatocytes]]) using excessive doses of [[acetaminophen]]. This caused hepatoxicity and hepatocyte death, which triggered an increase in the production of [[TLR9]]. The expression of TLR9 caused an inflammatory cascade involving [[pro–IL-1β]] and [[pro-IL-18]]. Aspirin was found to have a protective effect on hepatocytes because it led to the &quot;downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines&quot;.&lt;ref name=Imaeda2009&gt;{{Cite journal

In another 2009 article published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, men and women who regularly took aspirin after colorectal cancer diagnosis were found to have lower risks of overall and colorectal cancer death compared to patients not using aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Chan, ''et al.''|title=Aspirin Use and Survival After Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer|journal=JAMA|date=12 August 209| pages=649–658|volume=302|issue=6|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/302/6/649?rss=1|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1112|pmid=19671906|first2=S|first3=CS|last2=Ogino|last3=Fuchs|pmc=2848289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 article in the Journal of Clinical Oncology has suggested aspirin may reduce the risk of death from breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, M et al (2010). &quot;Aspirin intake and survival after breast cancer&quot;. ''Journal of Clinical Oncology'' (pre-publication). Available at http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/JCO.2009.22.7918v1&lt;/ref&gt; While the information has been well-circulated by the media,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Is aspirin a miracle drug?&quot;. ''ABC News'', 2010. Available at http://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/aspirin-miracle-drug-9980248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coomer, C (2010). &quot;Aspirin battling breast cancer&quot;. ''Fox News Health Blog'', available at http://health.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/02/17/aspirin-battling-breast-cancer/&lt;/ref&gt; official health bodies and medical groups have expressed concern over the touting of aspirin as a &quot;miracle drug&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Women warned aspirin reports may be misleading&quot;. ''National Prescribing Service'' (2010), available at http://www.nps.org.au/news_and_media/media_releases/repository/Women_warned_aspirin&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by Oxford University involving over 25000 patients showed taking a small (75&amp;nbsp;mg) daily dose of aspirin for between four and eight years substantially reduces death rates from a range of common cancers by at least a fifth and the reduction of risk continued for 20 years in both men and women. For specific cancers the, reduction was about 40% for [[bowel cancer]], 30% for [[lung cancer]], 10% for [[prostate cancer]] and 60% for [[oesophageal cancer]], while the reductions in [[pancreas cancer|pancreas]], [[stomach cancer|stomach]], [[brain cancer|brain]], [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[ovarian cancer]]s were difficult to quantify because there were not enough data, but other studies are in progress. However, taking aspirin doubles the annual risk of major internal bleeding that normally has a very low incidence (about 1 in 1000) in middle age, but increased dramatically after 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Small daily aspirin dose 'cuts cancer risk&quot;.

For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dorsch MP, Lee JS, Lynch DR, Dunn SP, Rodgers JE, Schwartz T, Colby E, Montague D, Smyth SS |title=Aspirin Resistance in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease with and without a History of Myocardial Infarction |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume= 41|issue=May |page= 737|year=2007 |pmid=17456544|doi=10.1345/aph.1H621}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 patients found 28% to be resistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18202034&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Krasopoulos G, Brister SJ, Beattie WS, Buchanan MR |title=Aspirin &quot;resistance&quot; and risk of cardiovascular morbidity: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7637 |pages=195–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18202034 |pmc=2213873|doi=10.1136/bmj.39430.529549.BE |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18202034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dosage===
[[Image:Regular strength enteric coated aspirin tablets.jpg|thumb|Coated 325&amp;nbsp;mg aspirin tablets]]
Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300&amp;nbsp;mg in Britain and 325&amp;nbsp;mg in the USA.  Smaller doses are based on these standards; thus 75 and 81&amp;nbsp;mg tablets are used—there is no medical significance in the slight difference.
It is of historical interest that the US 325mg dose is almost exactly equivalent to the historic 5 [[Grain_(unit)|grain]] aspirin tablet that preceded the metric dosage.

For adults, doses are generally taken four times a day for fever or arthritis,&lt;ref name=BNF&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary]]|edition=45|year=2003|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&amp;drugid=3881&amp;drugname=Aspirin+EC+Oral&amp;monotype=monograph |title=Aspirin monograph: dosages, etc |publisher=Medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.&lt;ref name=BNF /&gt;

New recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, March, 2009) on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/589895?src=cmemp |title=Medscape: Medscape Access |publisher=Cme.medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81&amp;nbsp;mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause.&lt;ref name=medscape /&gt; Low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81&amp;nbsp;mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.&lt;ref name=medscape /&gt;

In children with [[Kawasaki disease]], aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary for Children]]|year=2006|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastrointestinal===
Aspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H Toft&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sørensen HT, Mellemkjaer L, Blot WJ, ''et al.'' |title=Risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with use of low-dose aspirin |journal=Am.

In addition to enteric coating, &quot;buffering&quot; is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses MgO. Other preparations use CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |title=General Chemistry Online: FAQ: Acids and bases: What is the buffer system in buffered aspirin? |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking it with vitamin C is a more recently investigated method of protecting the stomach lining.

[[Deglycyrrhizinated licorice]] (DGL), an extract of the popular herb licorice, reportedly helps relieve the symptoms of gastritis. In a 1979 research study, a dose of 350 milligrams of DGL was shown to decrease the amount of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by three adult-strength aspirin tablets (750 milligrams).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Reese''et al.'' |title=Effect of deglycyrrhinized liquorice on gastric mucosal damage by aspirin |journal=Scand J Gastroenterol |year=1979 |issue=14 |pages=605–07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dose of 500 milligrams of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe, an amino acid naturally formed in the body) given together with a large dose of aspirin (1300 milligrams) in a research study reduced the amount of stomach damage by 90 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laudanno&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Laudanno ''et al.'' |title=Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) and S-adenosylmethionine in the prevention of hemorrhagic gastritis induced by aspirin in the human.

===Central effects===
Large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, have been proposed to cause [[tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on [[arachidonic acid]] and [[NMDA receptor]]s cascade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutton&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Guitton MJ, Caston J, Ruel J, Johnson RM, Pujol R, Puel JL |title=Salicylate induces tinnitus through activation of cochlear NMDA receptors |journal=J.

===Reye's syndrome===
{{Main|Reye's syndrome}}
Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute [[encephalopathy]] and [[fatty liver]], can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in under-18 patients were reported to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a [[Respiratory tract infection (disambiguation)|respiratory infection]], [[chickenpox]], or [[diarrhea]]. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported.&lt;ref name=Belay&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Belay ED, Bresee JS, Holman RC, Khan AS, Shahriari A, Schonberger LB |title=Reye's syndrome in the United States from 1981 through 1997 |journal=N.

Last reviewed: 16 December 2008 http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Reyes-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hives and swelling===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms that resemble an allergic reaction, including hives, swelling and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[Aspirin#Overdose|overdose]].

===Other effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema]] (swelling of skin tissues) in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients participating in the study. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Berges-Gimeno MP &amp; Stevenson DD |year=2004 |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced reactions and desensitization |journal=J Asthma |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=375–84 |pmid=15281324 |doi=10.1081/JAS-120037650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on [[MRI]] scans of 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm or smaller hypointense (dark holes) patches.&lt;ref&gt;Vernooij MW, Haag MD, van der Lugt A, Hofman A, Krestin GP, Stricker BH, Breteler MM.

Aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 elective surgical patients required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Scher, K.S. |year=1996 |title=Unplanned reoperation for bleeding |journal=Am Surg |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=52–55 |pmid=8540646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overdose===
{{Main|Aspirin poisoning}}
Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a [[mortality rate]] of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;{{vn|date=May 2011}} chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pediatrics1982-gaudreault&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gaudreault P, Temple AR, Lovejoy FH Jr |title=The relative severity of acute versus chronic salicylate poisoning in children: a clinical comparison |journal=Pediatrics |year=1982 |pages=566–9 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pmid= 7122154}} (primary source) {{MEDRS|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including [[activated charcoal]], intravenous dextrose and normal saline, [[sodium bicarbonate]], and dialysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=9780323028455 |page=2242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels generally range from 30–100&amp;nbsp;mg/L after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300&amp;nbsp;mg/L in patients taking high doses and 700–1400&amp;nbsp;mg/L following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to [[bismuth subsalicylate]], [[methyl salicylate]] and [[sodium salicylate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morra P, Bartle WR, Walker SE, Lee SN, Bowles SK, Reeves RA |title=Serum concentrations of salicylic acid following topically applied salicylate derivatives |journal=Ann.

===Interactions===
Aspirin is known to [[Drug interaction|interact]] with other drugs.

==Chemical properties==
Aspirin, an [[acetyl]] derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance, with a [[melting point]] of {{convert|135|C|0|abbr=on}}. Acetylsalicylic acid decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or of the [[acetates]],[[carbonates]], [[citrates]] or [[hydroxides]] of the [[alkali metals]]. Acetylsalicylic acid is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic [[acids]]. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.&lt;ref&gt;

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a [[chemical reaction]] that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[acetyl]] group, (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimental Organic Chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R. |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-28250-2 |page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known, although there had been indications aspirin might have a second crystalline form since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Peddy Vishweshwar, Jennifer A. McMahon, Mark Oliveira, Matthew L. Peterson, and Michael J. Zaworotko| title = The Predictably Elusive Form II of Aspirin|journal = [[J. Am. Chem.

The form II is only stable at 100 [[Kelvin|K]] and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s through the [[acetyl]] groups with the (acidic) [[methyl]] proton to [[carbonyl]] [[hydrogen bond]]s, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the [[carboxylic acid]] groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main|Mechanism of action of aspirin}}
&lt;!--[[Image:PTGS2 inhibited by Aspirin.png|thumb|Structure of PTGS2 inactivated by aspirin, in the active site of each of the two monomers, serine 530 has been acetylated. Also visible is the salicylic acid which has transferred the acyl group, and the heme cofactor.]]--&gt;

===Discovery of the mechanism===
In 1971, British [[pharmacologist]] [[John Robert Vane]], then employed by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[thromboxane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis as a mechanism of action for aspirin-like drugs|author = John Robert Vane| journal = Nature - New Biology| year = 1971| volume = 231| issue = 25| pages = 232–5| pmid= 5284360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vane JR, Botting RM |year=2003 |title=The mechanism of action of aspirin |journal=Thromb Res |volume=110 |issue=5–6 |pages=255–8 |pmid=14592543 |doi=10.1016/S0049-3848(03)00379-7 |url=http://www.eao.chups.jussieu.fr/polys/certifopt/saule_coxib/theme/1vane2003.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this discovery, he was awarded both a [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] in 1982 and a [[knighthood]].

===Suppression of prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an [[acetyl]] group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.

Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[platelet]]s, producing an inhibitory effect on [[platelet|platelet aggregation]]. This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in Heart Attack and Stroke Prevention |accessdate=2008-05-08 |publisher=American Heart Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40&amp;nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Tohgi| first = H| coauthors = S Konno, K Tamura, B Kimura and K Kawano|year = 1992|title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin|journal = Stroke| volume = 23|pages = 1400–1403 |pmid=1412574|issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostaglandins are local [[hormone]]s produced in the body and have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are primarily caused by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute [[myocardial infarction]]. An unwanted side effect of the effective anticlotting action of aspirin is that it may cause excessive bleeding.

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
There are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase: PTGS1 and PTGS2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits PTGS1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of PTGS2. Normally, PTGS2 produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, [[COX 2 inhibitor]]s, have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox3article&quot; /&gt;

However, several of the new COX 2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn recently, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.&lt;ref name=&quot;SomasundaramS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somasundaram, S. et al.|year=2000|title=Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|volume=14|pages=639–650|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x|pmid=10792129|author1=Somasundaram|first2=G|first3=RJ|first4=J|first5=M|first6=IA|first7=S|first8=A|first9=R|issue=5|last2=Sigthorsson|last3=Simpson|last4=Watts|last5=Jacob|last6=Tavares|last7=Rafi|last8=Roseth|last9=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses of aspirin are given, it may actually cause fever owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. Additionally, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to show aspirin helps to fight infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Mark J. |last=Paul-Clark |first2=Thong van |last2=Cao |first3=Niloufar |last3=Moradi-Bidhendi |first4=Dianne |last4=Cooper |first5=Derek W. |last5=Gilroy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=15-epi-lipoxin A4–mediated Induction of Nitric Oxide Explains How Aspirin Inhibits Acute Inflammation |journal=J.

===Effects upon hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity===
Aspirin, like other medications affecting [[prostaglandin]] synthesis, has profound effects on the [[pituitary]] gland, which indirectly affects a number of other hormones and physiological functions.Effects on [[growth hormone]], [[prolactin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|6642786}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] (with relevant effect on [[Triiodothyronine|T3]] and [[Thyroxine|T4]]) were observed directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|820703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[Salicylic acid]] is a weak acid, and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is poorly soluble in the [[pH|acidic]] conditions of the stomach, which can delay absorption of high doses for eight to 24 hours. The increased pH and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed rapidly there, which in turn allows more of the salicylate to dissolve. Owing to the issue of solubility, however, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;'RK Ferguson'&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Death following self-poisoning with aspirin|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=1970-08-17|first=RK|last=Ferguson|coauthors=Boutros, AR|volume=213|issue=7|pages=1186–8|pmid=5468267|doi=10.1001/jama.213.7.1186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;'FL Kaufman'&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Darvon poisoning with delayed salicylism: a case report|journal=Pediatrics|date=1970-04|first=FL|last=Kaufman|coauthors=Dubansky, AS|volume=49|issue=4|pages=610–1|pmid=5013423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM197208312870903|title=Salicylate accumulation kinetics in man|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=1972-09-31|first=G|last=Levy|coauthors=Tsuchiya, T|volume=287|issue=9|pages=430–2|pmid=5044917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound by [[protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 l/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. Conjugation with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] it forms salicyl acyl and phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first order to zero order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidneys|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the [[kidneys]] as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%) and acyl  glucuronides (5%), and gentisic acid (&lt; 1%). When small doses (less than 250&amp;nbsp;mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;'O Hartwig'&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pharmacokinetic considerations of common analgesics and antipyretics|journal=American Journal of Medicine|date=1983-11-14|first=Otto H|last=Hartwig|volume=75|issue=5A|pages=30–7|pmid=6606362 |pmc= |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(83)90230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;'AK Done'&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Salicylate intoxication.

==History==
{{Main|History of aspirin}}
[[File:Aspirine-1923.jpg|thumb|left|1923 advertisement]]
Plant extracts, including [[willow]] [[bark]] and [[spiraea]], of which salicylic acid was the active ingredient, had been known to help alleviate headaches, pains and fevers since antiquity. The father of modern medicine, [[Hippocrates]], who lived sometime between 460 BC and 377 BC, left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blaspirin.htm |title=History of aspirin |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A French chemist, [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]], was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853. In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various [[acid anhydride]]s, he mixed [[acetyl chloride]] with a [[sodium]] salt of salicylic acid ([[sodium salicylate]]). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified.&lt;ref name=gerhardt&gt;{{de icon}} {{Cite journal|author=Gerhardt C|title=Untersuchungen über die wasserfreien organischen Säuren |journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=87|pages=149–179|year=1853 |doi=10.1002/jlac.18530870107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no [[structural theory]] existed at that time, Gerhardt called the compound he obtained &quot;salicylic-acetic anhydride&quot; (''wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure''). This preparation of aspirin (&quot;salicylic-acetic anhydride&quot;) was one of the many reactions Gerhardt conducted for his paper on anhydrides and he did not pursue it further.

[[Image:BayerHeroin.png|thumb|right|180px|Advertisement for Aspirin, Heroin, Lycetol and Salophen]]
Six years later, in 1859, von Gilm obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called ''acetylierte Salicylsäure'', acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride.&lt;ref name=gilm&gt;{{de icon}} {{Cite journal|author=von Gilm H|title=Acetylderivate der Phloretin- und Salicylsäure|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=112|issue=2|pages=180–185|year=1859|doi=10.1002/jlac.18591120207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}}{{Cite journal|author= Schröder, Prinzhorn, Kraut K|title=Uber Salicylverbindungen|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1869|doi=10.1002/jlac.18691500102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, chemists working at [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] produced a synthetically altered version of [[salicin]], derived from the species, which caused less digestive upset than pure [[salicylic acid]]. The identity of the lead chemist on this project is a matter of controversy. Bayer's official story is the work was done by [[Felix Hoffmann]], but the Jewish chemist [[Arthur Eichengrün]] later claimed he was the lead investigator and records of his contribution were expunged under the [[Nazi]] regime. The new drug, formally acetylsalicylic acid, was named Aspirin by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] after the old [[botany|botanical]] name for [[meadowsweet]], ''Spiraea ulmaria''.

[[File:Abner ben Ner.jpg|thumb|250px|Tomb of Abner]]
In the [[Book of Samuel]], '''Abner''' ([[Biblical Hebrew]] אבנר בן נר meaning &quot;father of [or is a] light&quot;), is first cousin to [[Saul the King|Saul]] and commander-in-chief of his army (1 Samuel 14:50, 20:25). He is often referred to as the son of [[List of minor Biblical figures#Ner|Ner]].

==Biography==

Abner is only referred to incidentally in Saul's history (1 Samuel 17:55, 26:5),&lt;ref name=&quot;isbe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia|editor=James Orr|publisher=ISBE|location=US|year=1915|url=http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/A/ABNER/|accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous [[battle of Gilboa]] when Saul's power was crushed.  Seizing the youngest but only surviving of Saul's sons, [[Ish-bosheth]], Abner set him up as king over [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]] at [[Mahanaim]], east of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]]. [[David (biblical king)|David]], who was accepted as king by [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] alone, was meanwhile reigning at [[Hebron]], and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.

The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]] between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2 Samuel 2:12).  In the general engagement which followed, Abner was defeated and put to flight.  He was closely pursued by [[Asahel]], brother of [[Joab]], who is said to have been &quot;light of foot as a wild roe&quot; (2 Samuel 2:18).  As Asahel would not desist from the pursuit, though warned, Abner was compelled to slay him in self-defence.  This originated a deadly [[feud]] between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood. However, according to Josephus, in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1, Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of his brother, Asahel, the reason being that Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned Asahel and had no other choice but to kill him out of self defense. This battle was part of a civil war between David and Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul. After this battle Abner switched to the side of David and granted him control over the tribe of Benjamin. This act put Abner in David's favor. The real reason that Joab killed Abner was that he became a threat to his rank of general. He then justifies it later by mentioning his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbe&quot;/&gt;

For some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of David.  At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing Abner of sleeping with [[Rizpah]] (cf. 2 Samuel 3:7), one of Saul's [[concubine]]s, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the [[throne]] (cf. 2 Samuel 16:21ff.).&lt;ref name=&quot;isbe&quot;/&gt;

Abner was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with David, who welcomed him on the condition that his wife [[Michal]] should be restored to him. This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast.  Almost immediately after, however, Joab, who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew Abner at the gate of Hebron.  The ostensible motive for the [[assassination]] was a desire to avenge Asahel, and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time. The conduct of David after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2 Samuel 3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).

David had Abner buried in [[Hebron]] (2 Samuel 3.31-39). His tomb,  according to a medieval Jewish tradition, is considered to be in  a building not far from the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Soon after Abner's death, Ish-bosheth was assassinated as he slept (2 Samuel 4), and David became king of the reunited kingdoms (2 Samuel 5).

==Film==
In the 1960 film ''[[David and Goliath (1960 film)|David and Goliath]]'', Abner ([[Massimo Serato]]) tries to murder David (Ivica Pajer) when he returns in triumph after killing Goliath; however, Abner is slain by King Saul ([[Orson Welles]]).

'''Ahmed I Bakhti''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: احمد اول ''Aḥmed-i evvel'', {{lang-tr|I.Ahmet}}) (April 18, 1590 &amp;nbsp;– November 22, 1617) was the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1603 until his death in 1617.

==Biography==
Ahmed I's mother was [[Valide Sultan]] [[Handan Sultan]], an ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] who was originally named Helena. He was born at [[Manisa]] Palace. He succeeded his father [[Mehmed III]] (1595&amp;ndash;1603) in 1603 at age 13. He broke with the traditional fratricide and sent his brother Mustafa to live at the old palace at Bayezit along with their grandmother Safiye Sultan. He was known for his skills in fencing, poetry, horseback riding, and fluency in numerous languages.

In the earlier part of his reign Ahmed I showed decision and vigor, which were belied by his subsequent conduct. The wars which attended his accession both in [[Hungary]] and in [[Iran|Persia]] terminated unfavourably for the empire, and its prestige received its first check in the [[Treaty of Sitvatorok|Treaty of Zsitvatorok]], signed in 1606, whereby the annual tribute paid by [[Austria]] was abolished. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] were ceded to Persia.

Ahmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name Bahti. He was devoutly religious, spending much of his wealth to support the works of scholars and pious men. He also attempted to enforce conformance to Islamic laws and traditions, restoring the old regulations that prohibited alcohol and he attempted to enforce attendance at the [[Friday Mosque]] prayers and paying alms to the poor in the proper way.  Ahmed I died of [[typhus]] in 1617.

==Legacy==
[[File:Savary Franco Ottoman Capitulations 1615.jpg|thumb|Bilingual Franco-Turkish translation of the 1604 [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman Capitulations]] between Sultan Ahmed I and [[Henry IV of France]], published by [[François Savary de Brèves]] in 1615.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA799 ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid'' by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Today Ahmed I is remembered mainly for the construction of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (also known as the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]]), one of the masterpieces of [[Islamic architecture]]. The area in [[Istanbul]] around the Mosque is today called Sultanahmet. He died at [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]] and is buried in a mausoleum right outside the walls of the famous mosque.

He was married twice, to Valide Sultan [[Mahfiruze Hatice Sultan]], originally named Maria, a [[Greeks|Greek]], mother of [[Osman II]], and to Valide Sultan Kadinefendi [[Kösem Sultan]] or Mahpeyker, originally named Anastasia, a [[Greeks|Greek]], mother of [[Murad IV]] and [[Ibrahim I]]. He also had two sons named Bayezid and Suleiman.

==Rival to Ottoman Throne==
A half-brother of Amhed, [[Jahja]], resented his accession to the Ottoman throne in 1603, and spent his life scheming to become Sultan.

'''Ahmed II Khan Ghazi''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: احمد ثانى ''Aḥmed-i &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ānī'') &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;(February 25, 1643 &amp;nbsp;– February 6, 1695)&lt;/span&gt; was the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1691 to 1695. Ahmed II was born at [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Istanbul]], the son of Sultan [[Ibrahim I]] (1640&amp;ndash;48) by [[Valide Sultan]] [[Khadija Muazzez]], and succeeded his brother [[Suleiman II]] (1687&amp;ndash;91) in 1691.

Ahmed II's best known act was to confirm [[Mustafa Köprülü]] as [[grand vizier]]. Only a few weeks after his accession the Ottoman Empire sustained a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] from the [[Austria]]ns under Margrave [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis William]] of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and was driven from [[Hungary]]. During the four years of his reign disaster followed on disaster, and in 1695 Ahmed II died at [[Edirne]] Palace, worn out by disease and sorrow.

He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother [[Mustafa II]] (1695–1703). [[Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha]] and his daughter, [[Princess Hatice]] (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the ''[[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]]''.

== Biography ==
[[File:Ahmed III by John Young.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ahmed III by John Young]]
Ahmed III cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]'s menacing attitude. In fact both his wives were Frenchwomen. He awarded refuge in Ottoman territory to [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of [[Peter I of Russia]] (1672–1725) in the [[Battle of Poltava]] of 1709. King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] escaped to the Ottoman Empire after losing the [[Battle of Poltava]] against the [[Russian Empire|Russians]], which was a part of the [[Great Northern War]]. In 1710 he convinced the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under [[Baltacı Mehmet Pasha]] won a major victory at the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)|Battle of Prut]]. In the aftermath, Russia returned [[Azov]] back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of [[Taganrog]] and others in the area, and to stop interfering into the affairs of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Forced against his will into [[Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711|war with Russia]], Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman [[sovereign]] before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his [[grand vizier]] [[Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha]] succeeded in completely surrounding at the [[Pruth River Campaign]] in 1711. The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia. 

Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen [[Janissary|janissaries]], led by the [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Patrona Halil]], was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the sultan was forced to give up the throne.

Ahmed voluntarily led his nephew [[Mahmud I]] (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the [[Kafes]] previously occupied by Mahmud and died at [[Topkapı Palace]] after six years of confinement.

== Character of Ahmed III's rule ==
[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 006.jpg|thumb|Sultan Ahmed III receives French ambassador Vicomte d'Andrezel at [[Topkapı Palace]].]]
[[File:Marquis de Bonnac being received by Sultan Ahmed III.jpg|thumb|French ambassador [[Marquis de Bonnac]] being received by Sultan Ahmed III.]]
The reign of Ahmed III, which had lasted for twenty-seven years, although marked by the disasters of the [[Great Turkish War]], was not unsuccessful. The recovery of [[Azov]] and the [[Morea]], and the conquest of part of [[Persia]], managed to counterbalance the [[Balkans|Balkan]] territory ceded to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18]]. In 1716, he sent and army of 33,000 men to capture [[Corfu]] from the [[Republic of Venice]].

Ahmed III left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive [[taxation]] or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated [[Patronage|patron]] of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first [[printing press]] authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Constantinople, operated by [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]] (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).

It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the [[Danubian Principalities]] was introduced: previously, the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] had appointed [[Hospodar]]s, usually native [[Moldavia]]n and [[Wallachia]]n [[boyar]]s, to administer those provinces; after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711|Russian campaign]] of 1711, during which [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] found an ally in [[Moldavia]] [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the Porte began overtly deputizing [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[Greeks]] in that region, and extended the system to [[Wallachia]] after [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Stefan Cantacuzino]] established links with [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene of Savoy]]. The Phanariotes constituted a kind of ''[[Dhimmi]]'' nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.

== Marriages and issue ==
He married [[Mihrimah Sultan|Aminā (Emine) Mihr-î-Mâh Sultan]], and [[Rabia Sharmi|Râbi'a Sermi Sultan]]. By first wife he had [[Mustafa III]] and by second wife he had [[Abdul Hamid I]].

==In Fiction==
[[File:Ahmet III 1720.jpg|thumb|left|Sultan Ahmed III]]
A passage in [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' has the book's eponymous main character meet the deposed Ahmed III while on a ship from [[Venice]] to [[Constantinople]]. The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells Candide, who initially doubts his credentials:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not jesting, my name is Achmet III. For 
several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; 
my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of 
my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; 
my nephew, Sultan Mahmoud, sometimes allows me 
to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the 
Carnival at Venice&quot; ([http://www.archive.org/stream/candideotherroma00voltuoft/candideotherroma00voltuoft_djvu.txt]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer [[Nedim Gürsel]] and made into the setting of his 2001 novel ''Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul''.

In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did Voltaire (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.

The  {{Nihongo|'''Ainu'''|アイヌ}}, also called '''Aynu''', '''Aino''' (アイノ), and in historical texts '''Ezo''' (蝦夷), are [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people or groups in Japan and Russia. Historically they spoke the [[Ainu language]] and [[Ainu languages|related varieties]] and lived in [[Hokkaidō]], the [[Kuril Islands]], and much of [[Sakhalin]]. Most of those who identify themselves as Ainu still live in this same region, though the exact number of living Ainu is unknown. This is due to [[ethnic issues in Japan]] resulting in those with Ainu backgrounds hiding their identities and confusion over mixed heritages. In Japan, because of intermarriage over many years with Japanese, the concept of a pure Ainu ethnic group is no longer feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=1gHR0aGi6b&amp;dq=pure%20ainu%20no%20longer&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=pure%20Ainu%20ethnic%20group%20is%20no%20longer%20feasible&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of bilingualism and bilingual education, Volume 1997] By Colin Baker, Sylvia Prys Jones&lt;/ref&gt; Official estimates of the population are of around 25,000, while the unofficial number is upward of 200,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poisson, B 2002, p.5&quot;/&gt;

==History==
Ainu culture dates from around 1200 CE&lt;ref name=&quot;fieldmuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/anthropology/anthro_sites/boone/ainu/ainu_map/ainu_map6.html|title=The Boone Collection – Image Gallery: Ainu Artifacts|publisher=[[Field Museum of Natural History]]|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent research suggests that it originated in a merger of the [[Okhotsk culture|Okhotsk]] and [[Satsumon culture|Satsumon]] cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato, Takehiro 2007&quot;&gt;Sato, Takehiro; et al. (2007). &quot;Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis&quot;. Journal of Human Genetics 52 (7): 618–627. doi:10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z&lt;/ref&gt; In 1264, [[Nivkh people]] reported to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] that Ainu invaded the land of Nivkh, resulting in battles between Ainu and the Yuan Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html|title=第59回 交易の民アイヌ Ⅶ 元との戦い|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Asahikawa, Hokkaidō|Asahikawa City]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active contact between the [[Wajin]] (the ethnically Japanese) and the Ainu of Ezochi (now known as [[Hokkaido]]) began in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, M (eds) 1997, Japan’s Minorities: The Illusion of Homogeneity, Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ainu were a society of hunter-gatherers, who lived mainly by hunting and fishing, and the people followed a religion based on phenomena of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu.html &quot;NOVA Online – Island of the Spirits – Origins of the Ainu&quot;]. Retrieved on May 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bjs48 02 Ainu.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A group of Ainu people (between 1863 and early 1870s)]]
During the Tokugawa period (1600–1868) the Ainu became increasingly involved in trade with Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island that is now called Hokkaido. The Bakufu government granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the Northern part of the island. Later the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period Ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by Japanese, and suffered from epidemic diseases such as smallpox.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56&quot;&gt;Brett L. Walker, The conquest of Ainu Lands:Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion 1590-1800-University of California Press,2001,Pages 49–56,61–71 and Pages 172–176&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point for Ainu culture was the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868. A variety of social, political and economic reforms were introduced by the Japanese government, in hope of modernising the country in the Western style, and included the annexation of Hokkaido.  Sjöberg quotes Baba’s (1980) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:&lt;ref name=&quot;Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56&quot;/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘ … The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia.  Second … it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class … Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy.’&lt;ref&gt;Sjöberg, K 1993, The Return of the Ainu, Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labeling the Ainu as former aborigines, with the idea they would assimilate—this resulted in the land the Ainu people lived on being taken by the Japanese government, and was from then on under Japanese control.&lt;ref&gt;Loos, N &amp; Osani, T 1993, Indigenous Minorities and Education, Sanyusha Publishing Co., Ltd., Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.

[[File:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|250px|Ainu bear sacrifice. Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870.]]
The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land—over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Philippa |last= Fogarty|title=  Recognition at last for Japan's Ainu|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437244.stm|work= BBC News|publisher= BBC|date= June 6, 2008|accessdate=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wajin who had decided to move to Hokkaido, who had been encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island’s abundance of natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of western industrial agriculture.   This development was termed ''Kaitakushi''.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, S 2008, ‘The Ainu’s modern struggle’ in World Watch, Vol 21, No. 6, pp. 20–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as this, factories such as flour mills and beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöberg, K 1993, The Return of the Ainu, Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Levinson|first= David |title=Encyclopedia of modern Asia, Volume 1|publisher= Charles Scribner's Sons|page= 72|year= 2002
|isbn= 9780684806174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1899 act mentioned above was replaced in 1997—until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato, Takehiro 2007&quot;/&gt; It was not until June 6, 2008 that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see [[#Official recognition|Official Recognition]], below).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato, Takehiro 2007&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Oki Ainu Dub Band at tff.Rudolstadt 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The Oki Dub Ainu Band, led by the Ainu Japanese musician [[Oki (musician)|Oki]], in Germany in 2007]]
Intermarriages between Japanese and Ainu were actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, [[Oki (musician)|Oki]], born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument ''[[tonkori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/article/605230042/|title=アイヌ⇔ダブ越境！異彩を放つOKIの新作|language=Japanese|publisher=HMV Japan|date=May 23, 2006|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many small towns in the southeastern or [[Hidaka Subprefecture|Hidaka]] region where full-blooded Ainu may still be seen such as in [[Nibutani]] ([[Ainu language|Ainu]]: ''Niputay''). In [[Sambutsu]] especially, on the eastern coast, many children of such marriages may be seen.

Their most widely known [[ethnonym]] is derived from the word ''ainu'', which means &quot;human&quot; (particularly as opposed to ''kamui'', divine beings), basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race, in the Hokkaidō dialects of the [[Ainu language]]; '''[[Emishi]]''' (Ebisu) and '''[[Ezo]]''' {{IPA|[endzo]}} (Yezo)  (both {{lang|ja|蝦夷}}) are Japanese terms, which are believed to derive from another word for &quot;human&quot;, which otherwise survived in Sakhalin Ainu as ''enciw'' or ''enju''. Today, many Ainu dislike the term Ainu because it had once been used with derogatory nuance, and prefer to identify themselves as ''Utari'' (''comrade'' in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.

===Official recognition===
On June 6, 2008, a bi-partisan, non-binding resolution was approved by the [[Japanese Diet]] calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous to Japan]] and urge an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognised the Ainu people as &quot;an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture&quot; and rescinds the law passed in 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ito, M|title=Diet officially declares Ainu indigenous|publisher=Japan Times|date=June 7, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2009|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080607a1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the resolution is historically significant, Hideaki Uemura, professor at [[Keisen University]] in Tokyo and a specialist in indigenous peoples' rights, commented that the motion is &quot;weak in the sense of recognizing historical facts&quot; as the Ainu were &quot;forced&quot; to become Japanese in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes2008&quot; /&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of the Ainu have often been considered Jōmon-jin, natives to Japan from the [[Jōmon period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denoon|first=Donald; Hudson, Mark|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Multicultural Japan: palaeolithic to postmodern]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0521003628|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the Children of the Sun came&quot; is told in one of their Yukar Upopo (Ainu legends).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoberg1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Return of the Ainu: Cultural Mobilization and the Practice of Ethnicity in Japan |last=Sjöberg |first=Katarina V. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Harwood Academic Publ. |location=Chur |series=Studies in Anthropology and History |volume=9 |isbn=3718654016 |pages= |oclc=27684176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ainu culture as it is known today dates from around the year 1200&lt;ref name=&quot;fieldmuseum&quot;/&gt; and recent research suggests that it originated in a merger of the [[Okhotsk culture|Okhotsk]] and Satsumon cultures, one of the ancient Japanese cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato2007&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Sato | first = Takehiro | authorlink = | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | month = | title = Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 52 | issue = 7 | pages = 618–627 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z | url = | quote = | pmid = 17568987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their economy was based on farming as well as hunting, fishing and gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu.html |title=NOVA Online – Island of the Spirits – Origins of the Ainu |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic testing of the Ainu people has shown them to belong mainly to [[Haplogroup D (Y-DNA)|Y-haplogroup D2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tajima2004&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Tajima | first = Atsushi | authorlink = | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | month = | title = Genetic origins of the Ainu inferred from combined DNA analyses of maternal and paternal lineages  | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 187–193 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-004-0131-x | url = | quote = | pmid = 14997363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Y-DNA haplogroup D2 is found frequently throughout the [[Japanese Archipelago]] including [[Okinawa]].

In a study by Tajima ''et al.'' (2004), two out of a sample of sixteen (or 12.5%) Ainu men have been found to belong to [[Haplogroup C3 (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup C3]], which is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tajima2004&quot;/&gt; Hammer ''et al.''

Based on analysis of one sample of 51 modern Ainus, their mtDNA lineages have been reported to consist mainly of [[haplogroup Y (mtDNA)|haplogroup Y]] (11/51 = 21.6% according to Tanaka ''et al.'' 2004, or 10/51 = 19.6% according to Adachi ''et al.'' 2009, who have cited Tajima ''et al.'' 2004), [[haplogroup D (mtDNA)|haplogroup D]] (9/51 = 17.6%, particularly D4(xD1)), [[haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M7a]] (8/51 = 15.7%), and [[haplogroup G (mtDNA)|haplogroup G1]] (8/51 = 15.7%).&lt;ref name = &quot;Tajima2004&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanaka2004&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Tanaka | first = Masashi | authorlink = | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | month = | title = Mitochondrial Genome Variation in Eastern Asia and the Peopling of Japan | journal = Genome Research | volume = 14 | issue = 10A| pages = 1832–1850 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2286304 | url = | quote =| pmid = 15466285 | pmc = 524407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Adachi2009&quot;&gt;Noboru Adachi, Ken-ichi Shinoda, Kazuo Umetsu, and Hirofumi Matsumura, &quot;Mitochondrial DNA Analysis of Jomon Skeletons From the Funadomari Site, Hokkaido, and Its Implication for the Origins of Native American,&quot; ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' 138:255–265 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup Y is otherwise found mainly among [[Nivkhs]], and with lower frequency among [[Tungusic peoples]], [[Koreans]], [[Mongols]] (including [[Kalmyks]] and [[Buryats]]), [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], Japanese, [[Central Asia]]ns, South Siberian Turkic peoples (e.g. [[Tuvans]], [[Todjins]], [[Soyots]]), [[Koryaks]], [[Alyutors]], [[Itelmens]], [[Taiwanese aborigines]], [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], [[Indonesia]]ns, and [[Malaysia]]ns. MtDNA Haplogroup D is found frequently throughout East Asia and Central Asia, and is also common in some populations of North Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Americas; in addition, it has been found with low frequency in some populations of Europe and Southwest Asia. Haplogroup M7a has been found elsewhere mainly among Japanese and [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]], and with lower frequency among [[Udege people|Udegeys]], [[Koreans]], Chinese, [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], [[Taiwanese aborigines]], [[Buryats]], [[Central Asia]]ns, and [[War language|Waars]] of the [[Jaintia Hills district|Jaintia Hills]] in [[Meghalaya]], India.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tanaka2004&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Jin2010&quot;&gt;Han-Jun Jin, Ki-Cheol Kim, and Wook Kim, &quot;Genetic Diversity of Two Haploid Markers in the Udegey Population From Southeastern Siberia,&quot; ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Derenko2007&quot;&gt;Miroslava Derenko, Boris Malyarchuk, Tomasz Grzybowski, Galina Denisova, Irina Dambueva, Maria Perkova, Choduraa Dorzhu, Faina Luzina, Hong Kyu Lee, Tomas Vanecek, Richard Villems, and Ilia Zakharov, &quot;Phylogeographic Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA in Northern Asian Populations,&quot; ''American Journal of Human Genetics'', 2007 November; 81(5): 1025–1041.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kivisild2002&quot;&gt;Toomas Kivisild, Helle-Viivi Tolk, Jüri Parik, Yiming Wang, Surinder S.

A recent reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the Jōmon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shigematsu2004&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Shigematsu | first = Masahito | authorlink = | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | month = | title = Morphological affinities between Jomon and Ainu: Reassessment based on nonmetric cranial traits | journal = Anthropological Science | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–172 | doi = 10.1537/ase.00092 | url = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with the reference to the Ainu culture being a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures referenced above.

Some have speculated that the Ainu may be descendants of a prehistoric group of humans that also produced [[indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian]] peoples. In [[Steve Olson (writer)|Steve Olson]]'s book ''Mapping Human History'', page 133, he describes the discovery of fossils dating back 10,000 years, representing the remains of the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]], a group whose facial features more closely resemble those of the indigenous peoples of [[New Guinea]] and Australia.

After a new wave of immigration, probably from the Korean Peninsula some 2,300 years ago, of the [[Yayoi people]], the Jōmon were pushed into northern Japan. Genetic data suggest that modern Japanese are descended from both the Yayoi and the Jōmon.

==Geography==
The Ainu were distributed in the northern and central islands of Japan, from Sakhalin island in the north to the Kuril islands and the island of Hokkaidō and Northern Honshū, although some investigators place their former range as throughout Honshū and as far north as the southern tip of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in what is now [[Cape Lopatka]]. The island of Hokkaido was known to the Ainu as Ainu Moshir, and was formally annexed by the Japanese at the late date of 1868, partly as a means of preventing the intrusion of the Russians, and partly for imperialist reasons.

[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-Sakhalin. Part II. Group of Ainu People.png|thumb|right|A group of Sakhalin Ainu around 1903]]
According to the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897, 1446 persons in the Russian Empire reported Ainu language as their mother tongue, 1434 of them in Sakhalin Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=o Russian Empire Census of 1897: Totals]
[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=113 Russian Empire Census of 1897: Sakhalin] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern half of Sakhalin was acquired by Japan as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05, but at the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviets [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)|declared war on Japan]] and took possession of the Kurie islands and southern Sakhalin. The Ainu population, as previously Japanese subjects, were &quot;repatriated&quot; to Japan.

According to the 2002 Russian Federation census, no responders gave the ethnonym Ainu in boxes 7 or 9.2 in the K-1 form of the census,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-3.xls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perepis2002.ru/index.html?id=87&lt;/ref&gt; though some still might exist.

The only Ainu speakers remaining (besides perhaps a few partial speakers) live solely in Japan. There, they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of Hokkaidō.

Due to intermarriage with the Japanese and ongoing absorption into the predominant culture, there are no truly Ainu settlements existing in Japan today. The town of [[Nibutani]] ([[Ainu language|Ainu]]: ''Niputay'') in Hidaka area (Hokkaido prefecture) has a number of Ainu households and a visit to some of the Ainu owned craft shops close to the Ainu museums (there are two of them in Nibutani) is an opportunity to interact with the Ainu people. Many &quot;authentic Ainu villages&quot; advertised in Hokkaido such as [[Akan, Hokkaidō|Akan]] and [[Shiraoi, Hokkaidō|Shiraoi]] are tourist attractions and provide an opportunity to see and meet Ainu people.

==Language==
{{Main|Ainu languages}}

Today, it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remain,&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, S. 2008, &quot;The Ainu's modern struggle&quot; in ''World Watch'', Vol 21., No. 6, pp. 20–24.&lt;/ref&gt; while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers – the language has been regarded as “endangered”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Vovin|Vovin, A.]] 1993, ''A Reconstruction of Proto-Ainu'', Brill, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.

The Ainu language is significantly different from the Japanese language in its syntax, phonology, morphology, and vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Although there have been attempts to show that they are related, modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact, such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;Shibatani, M. 1990, ''The Languages of Japan'', Cambridge University Press, London, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, no attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;Shibatani, M. 1990, The Languages of Japan, Cambridge university Press, London, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Words used as prepositions in English (such as to, from, by, in, and at) are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or [[agglutinate]]d sounds or [[morphemes]] that represent nouns or ideas.

The Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese [[kana]] or the Russian Cyrillic and now Latin alphabets by investigators. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent [[terminal consonant]]s has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu.  For example, some words, such as &quot;''Kor''&quot; (meaning &quot;to hold&quot;), are now pronounced with a terminal vowel sound, as in &quot;''Koro''&quot;.

Many of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the [[Yukar]], or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the [[Uepeker tales|Uepeker]] (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.&lt;ref&gt;Omniglot, 2009, “Ainu”, retrieved August 2, 2009, http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ainu.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Ainu cuisine|Ainu music|Yukar|}}
[[File:Woman playing traditional Ainu instrument.jpg|thumb|Woman playing traditional Ainu instrument]]
[[File:Ainu ceremonial dress.jpg|thumb|Ainu ceremonial dress. [[British Museum]].]]
Traditional Ainu culture was quite different from [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full [[beard]]s and [[moustache]]s. Men and women alike cut their [[hair]] level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women [[tattoo]]ed their [[mouth]]s, and sometimes the [[forearm]]s. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for color. Their traditional [[Clothing|dress]] was a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree, called attusi or attush. Various styles of clothing were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.

Modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or [[salmon]]. Both sexes are fond of [[earring]]s, which are said to have been made of [[grape]]vine in former times, as also are bead necklaces called [[tamasay]], which the women prized highly.

Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of bear, [[fox]], [[wolf]], [[badger]], [[ox]] or [[horse]], as well as [[fish]], [[fowl]], [[millet]], [[vegetable]]s, [[herb]]s, and [[root]]s. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.

Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest {{convert|20|ft|0|abbr=on}} square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center. There was no chimney, only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed.

Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of flag{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used [[chopstick]]s when eating; the women had wooden [[spoon]]s. [[Ainu cuisine]] is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaidō, serving primarily Japanese fare.

The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. [[Corporal punishment|Beating]] was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed.

==Hunting==
The Ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer. The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn, [[plant gathering]], salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered. A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor) . Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory. The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of [[sika deer]]), [[rabbit]], [[fox]], [[raccoon dog]] and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu as were [[salmon]]. They also hunted [[sea eagles]] such as [[white-tailed sea eagles]], raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese. The Ainu hunted with [[arrows]] and [[spear]]s with poison-coated points. They obtained the [[poison]], called &quot;[[surku]]&quot;, from the roots and stalks of [[aconitum|aconites]]. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, [[tobacco]], and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers. They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the god of fire and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.

The Ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw. At that time bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an &quot;amappo&quot;.

The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also they often used traps, including spring traps loaded with arrows. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.

==Religion==
{{Further|[[Ainu creation myth]]}}
The Ainu are traditionally [[animists]], believing that everything in nature has a ''[[kamuy]]'' (spirit or god) on the inside. There is a hierarchy of the ''kamui''.

The most important is grandmother earth (fire), then ''kamui'' of the [[mountain]] (animals), then ''kamui'' of the sea ([[Marine biology|sea animals]]), lastly everything else. They have no [[priests]] by profession.

The village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary; ceremonies are confined to making [[libation]]s of [[sake|rice beer]], uttering [[prayers]], and offering [[willow]] sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called ''[[inaw]]'' (singular) and ''nusa'' (plural).

They are placed on an altar used to &quot;send back&quot; the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called ''[[Iomante]]''. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of [[Illness|sickness]]. They believe their spirits are [[Immortality|immortal]], and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to ''kamui mosir'' (Land of the Gods).

Some Ainu in the north are members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Ornaments==
Men wore a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] called &quot;sapanpe&quot; for important ceremonies. Sapanpe was made from wood fiber with bundles of partially-shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its center. Men carried an &quot;emush&quot; (sword) secured by an &quot;emush at&quot; strap to their shoulders.

Women wore a &quot;matanpushi&quot; (embroidered headband) and &quot;ninkari&quot; (earrings).

Ninkari was a metal [[ring (jewellery)|ring]] with a ball. Women wore it through a hole in the ear. Matanpushi and ninkari were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called &quot;maidari&quot; now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called &quot;tekunkani.&quot;

Women wore a necklace called &quot;rekutunpe,&quot; a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques. They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a &quot;tamasay&quot; or &quot;shitoki,&quot; usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent. The Ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the Matsumae Clan.

==Housing==

[[File:Ainu traditional house”cise”3.jpg|thumb|The family would gather around the fireplace]]
A village is called a &quot;kotan&quot; in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal [[clan]]. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.

Kotan houses were made of [[cogon grasses]], [[bamboo grass]], [[bark]]s, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the &quot;rorun-puyar,&quot; a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side) , through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called &quot;shiso&quot;) . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called &quot;harkiso&quot;). The house had a platform for valuables called &quot;iyoykir&quot; behind the shiso. The Ainu placed &quot;shintoko&quot;(hokai) and &quot;ikayop&quot; (quivers) there.

Outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called &quot;ashinru&quot; and for women called &quot;menokoru&quot;, a &quot;pu&quot; (storehouse) for food, a &quot;heper set&quot; (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar &quot;nusasan&quot; faced the east side of the house (rorunpuyar). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as &quot;lyomante,&quot; a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.

==Life of Ainu==
The Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called ''tunpu'' annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.

The age of marriage was 17–18 years old for men and 15–16 years for women, who were [[tattoo]]ed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.

When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts with each other. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, Ieggings, and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many ''yomeiri'' marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.

For a ''yomeiri'' marriage, a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, including a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket (''hokai''). If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house. At the wedding ceremony, participants prayed to the god of fire. Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl, and other participants were entertained.

The worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as ''attush'', until coming of age.

Newborn babies were named ''ayay'' (a baby's crying), ''shipo'', ''poyshi'' (small excrement), ''shion'' (old excrement), etc. Children were called by these &quot;temporary&quot; names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born. Their tentative names had a portion meaning &quot;excrement&quot; or &quot;old things&quot; to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behavior or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents' wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.

Men wore [[loincloth]]s and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 15–16. Women were also considered adults at the age of 15–16. They wore underclothes called ''mour'' and had their hair dressed properly and wound [[waistcloth]]s called ''raunkut'', ''ponkut'', etc. around their bodies. When women reached age 12–13, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed. When they reached age 15–16, their tattoos were completed. Thus were they qualified for marriage.

==American continent connection theory==
In the late 20th century, speculation arose that people of the group related to the [[Jōmon]] may have been one of the first to settle [[North America]]. This theory is based largely on skeletal and cultural evidence among tribes living in the western part of North America and certain parts of [[South America]].

It is possible that North America had several peoples among its early settlers—these relatives of the Jōmon being one of them. The best known evidence that may support this theory is probably [[Kennewick Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060425183740.htm Kennewick Man Skeletal Find May Revolutionalize Continent's History], ''Science Daily'', April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/280/5361/191 ANTHROPOLOGY: Kennewick Man's Contemporaries], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic map#Linkage mapping|Genetic mapping]] studies by [[Cavalli-Sforza]] have shown a sharp gradient in gene frequencies centered in the area around the [[Sea of Japan]], and particularly in the [[Japanese Archipelago]], that distinguishes these populations from others in the rest of eastern Asia and most of the American continent. This gradient appears as the third most important genetic movement (in other words, the third principal component of genetic variation) in Eurasia (after the &quot;Great expansion&quot; from [[Africa]], which has a [[cline]] centered in [[Arabia]] and adjacent parts of the [[Middle East]], and a second cline that distinguishes the northern regions of Eurasia and particularly [[Siberia]] from regions to the south), which would make it consistent with the early Jōmon period, or possibly even the pre-Jōmon period.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza. ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' p.253, ISBN 0-691-08750-4: &quot;The synthetic maps suggest a previously unsuspected center of expansion from the Sea of Japan but cannot indicate dates. This development could be tied to the Jōmon period, but one cannot entirely exclude the pre-Jōmon period and that it might be responsible for a migration to the Americas. A major source of food in those pre-agricultural times came from fishing, then as now, and this would have limited for ecological reasons the area of expansion to the coastline, perhaps that of the Sea of Japan, but also father along the Pacific Coast.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutions==
[[File:Ainu promotion center, Sapporo.JPG|thumb|Ainu cultural promotion center and museum, in [[Sapporo]]  (Sapporo Pirka Kotan)]]

Most Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the [[Hokkaido Utari Association]]. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese [[nation-state]]. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.

Other key institutions include ''The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC)'', set up by the Japanese Government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the [http://www.cais.hokudai.ac.jp/en/index.html Hokkaido University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies] established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers.  Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.&lt;ref&gt;Links to these organizations needed, also Tokyo Ainu documentary, http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/top.htm, and http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/groups.htm has links to Tokyo area Ainu groups.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current affairs==
===Litigation===

On March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the [[Saru River]] watershed in southern Hokkaido. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Levin, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Essential Commodities and Racial Justice: Using Constitutional Protection of Japan’s Indigenous Ainu People to Inform Understandings of the United States and Japan], New York University Journal of International Law and Politics, Vol. 33, pp. 445-46, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to [[Nibutani]] village,&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Mark (trans.), Kayano et al. v. Hokkaido Expropriation Committee: ‘The Nibutani Dam Decision’ (1999). International Legal Materials, Vol. 38, p. 394, 1999. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635447 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Levin, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Essential Commodities] p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and [[Shigeru Kayano|Kayano Shigeru]]—well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Idem.], p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;  After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaido Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaido Development Bureau.

The final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a giant victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635447 Nibutani Dam Decision (Levin trans.)]; see also [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Idem.], p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as &quot;Wajin&quot; in the case and discussions about the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635447 Nibutani Dam Decision (Levin trans.)]; see also Mark A. Levin, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1551462 The Wajin’s Whiteness: Law and Race Privilege in Japan], Horitsu Jiho, Vol. 80, No. 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;japan_con&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Constitution of Japan |url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Japan/English/english-Constitution.html |publisher=Solon.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two week later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Act—the 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_hitchingham_masako.pdf Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture &amp; Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions (Hitchingham trans.)]; see also, Mark A. Levin, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Essential Commodities] p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japan's view of the Ainu people is a testament to the importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the 'Cultural Landscape along the [[Saru River|Sarugawa River]] resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement' was designated an [[Cultural Landscapes of Japan|Important Cultural Landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=412&amp;item_id=00003550 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Citation to Levin and Tsunemoto in Oklahoma Law Review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental advisory boards===

Much national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as ''shingikai/''審議会 in Japanese.  One such committee operated in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Citation to Siddle's book&quot;&gt;Citation to Siddle's book&lt;/ref&gt; and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_hitchingham_masako.pdf Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture &amp; Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions (Hitchingham trans.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citation to Siddle's book&quot;/&gt;

More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included.  It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

*Sakhalin Ainu – Pure blooded individuals may be surviving in Hokkaido. From both Northern and Southern Sakhalin, a total of 841 Ainu were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. Only a few in remote interior areas remained, as the island was turned over to Russia. Even when Japan was granted Southern Sakhalin in 1905, only a handful returned. Japanese census of 1905 counted only 120 Sakhalin Ainu (down from 841 in 1875, 93 in Karafuto and 27 in Hokkaido). Russian census of 1926 counted 5 Ainu, while several of their multiracial children were recorded as ethnic Nivkh, Slav or Uilta.
** North Sakhalin – Only 5 pure blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Russian Census in Northern Sakhalin. Most of the Sakhalin Ainu (mainly from coastal areas) were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. The few remained (mainly from remote interior) were mostly married to Russians as can be seen from the works of [[Bronisław Piłsudski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;howell2005&quot;&gt;Howell, David L. (2005). [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0prtzCvKb50C&amp;pg=PA187 ''Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan'']. [[University of California Press]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Southern Sakhalin ([[Karafuto]]) – Japanese rule until 1945. Japan evacuated almost all the Ainus to Hokkaido after the WW2. Isolated individuals might have remained in Sakhalin.&lt;ref&gt;http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_26.php?reg=1420&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, there were about 100 Ainu living in Russian Sakhalin.&lt;ref name=&quot;wurm&quot;&gt;Wurm, Stephen Adolphe; Mühlhäusler, Peter; Tryon, Darrell T.

[[Walter de Gruyter]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 1010.&lt;/ref&gt;  

*Northern Kuril Ainu (no known living population) – Also known as Kurile in Russian records. Were under Russian rule till 1875. First came under Japanese rule after the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]]. Major population was on the island of [[Shumshu]], with a few others in islands like [[Paramushir]]. Altogether they numbered 221 in 1860. They had Russian names, spoke Russian fluently and were [[Russian Orthodox]] in religion. As the islands were gifted to the Japanese, more than a hundred Ainu fled to Kamchatka along with their Russian employers (where they were assimilated in to the [[Kamchadal]] population).&lt;ref name=&quot;wurm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minichiello, Sharon (1998).

[[University of Hawaii Press]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Only about half remained under Japanese rule. In order to [[Russification|derussify]] the Kurile, the entire population of 97 individuals were relocated to [[Shikotan]] in 1884, given Japanese names and children were enrolled in to Japanese schools. Unlike the other Ainu groups, the Kurile failed to adjust to their new surroundings and by 1933 only 10 individuals were alive (plus another 34 multiracial individuals). The last group of 20 individuals (including a few pure bloods) were evacuated to Hokkaido in 1941, where they vanished as a separate ethnic group soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;howell2005&quot;/&gt;

*Southern Kuril Ainu (no known living population) – Numbered almost 2,000 people (mainly in [[Kunashir]], [[Iturup]] and [[Urup]]) during the 18th century. In 1884, their population had decreased to 500. Around 50 individuals (mostly multiracial) who remained in 1941 were evacuated to Hokkaido by the Japanese soon after WW2.&lt;ref name=&quot;wurm&quot;/&gt;

*Kamchatka Ainu (no known living population) – Known as Kamchatka Kurile in Russian records. Ceased to exist as a separate ethnic group after their defeat in 1706 by the Russians. Individuals were assimilated in to the Kurile and [[Kamchadal]] ethnic groups. Last recorded in 18th century by Russian explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Shibatani, Masayoshi (1990). [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sD-MFTUiPYgC&amp;pg=PA3 ''The languages of Japan'']. [[Cambridge University Press]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Amur Valley Ainu (probably none remain) – a few individuals married to ethnic Russians and ethnic Ulchi reported by Bronisław Piłsudski in early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Piłsudski, Bronisław; Majewicz, Alfred F. (2004). [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NX0W2N8pgWQC&amp;pg=PA816 ''The collected works of Bronisław Piłsudski Volume 3'']. [[Walter de Gruyter]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 816.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 26 pure blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Russian Census in Nikolaevski Okrug (present day [[Nikolayevsky_District,_Khabarovsk_Krai|Николаевский район]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_26.php?reg=1410&lt;/ref&gt; Probably assimilated in to the Slavic rural population. Although no one identifies as Ainu nowadays in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], there are a large number of [[Ulch people|ethnic Ulch]] with partial Ainu ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Shaman: an international journal for Shamanistic research, Volumes 4-5 p.155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piłsudski, Bronisław; Majewicz, Alfred F.

'''Acropolis''' ({{lang-el|Ακρόπολις}}) means &quot;high city&quot; in Greek, literally ''city on the extremity'' and is usually translated into English as '''Citadel''' (''akros, akron,''&lt;ref&gt;acro- (n.d.) The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved September 29, 2008, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acro- from Dictionary.com website:] Quote: &quot;[From Greek akros, extreme; see ak- in Indo-European roots.] &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; edge, extremity + ''polis,'' city, pl. acropoleis). For purposes of defense, early people naturally chose elevated ground to build a new settlement, frequently a hill with precipitous sides. In many parts of the world, these early [[citadel]]s became the nuclei of large cities, which grew up on the surrounding lower ground, such as modern [[Rome]]. 

The word ''acropolis'', although [[Greek language|Greek]] in origin and associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even Castle Rock in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]].

The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 World Heritage: Acropolis, Athens ]&lt;/ref&gt; which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''.  Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]].

Because of its classical Greco-Roman style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the &quot;American Acropolis&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as ''La Rocca'' of the commune.

The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] cities, including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].

{{Alternative medical systems}}
'''Acupuncture''' is an [[alternative medicine]] that treats patients by insertion and manipulation of needles in the body. Its proponents variously claim that it relieves [[pain]], treats [[infertility]], treats [[disease]], prevents disease, or promotes general [[health]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorlands&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Novak, Patricia D. |author2=Dorland, Norman W. |author3=Dorland, William Alexander Newman |title=[[Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary]] |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1995 |edition=25th |pages= |isbn=0-7216-5738-9 |oclc=33123537 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficacy of acupuncture, beyond the [[placebo effect]] has never been unequivocally demonstrated.  Acupuncture typically incorporates [[traditional Chinese medicine]] as an integral part of its practice and theory. However, many practitioners consider 'Traditional Chinese Medicine' (TCM) to narrowly refer to modern mainland Chinese practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;fruehauf&quot;&gt;[http://chineseclassics.org/j/images/tcmcrisis.pdf Fruehauf: TCM in Crisis]&lt;/ref&gt;  Acupuncture in Japan and Korea, and to a certain extent Taiwan, diverged from mainland China in theory and practice. In European countries such as the UK almost half the practitioners follow these non-TCM practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks,Hicks&amp;Mole&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hicks, Angela |author2=Hicks, John |author3=Mole, Peter |title=[[Five Element Constitutional Acupuncture]] |publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=London |year=2004 |edition=1st |pages=ix |isbn=o443071705 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable difference is that these other approaches often are primarily acupuncture, and do not incorporate Chinese herbal medicine. The term “acupuncture” is sometimes used to refer to insertion of needles at points other than traditional ones, or to applying an electric current to needles in acupuncture points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peñas2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=de las Peñas |first1=César Fernández |last2=Arendt-Nielsen |first2=Lars |last3=Gerwin |first3=Robert D |title=Tension-type and cervicogenic headache: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |year =2010 |accessdate = 2011-01-29 |isbn=9780763752835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Robertson2006'&gt;{{cite book |last1= Robertson |first1=Valma J |last2=Robertson |first2=Val |last3=Low |first3=John |last4=Ward |first4=Alex |last5=Reed |first5=Ann |title=Electrotherapy explained: principles and practice |publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]] |year=2006  |isbn=9780750688437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture dates back to [[prehistoric]] times, with written records from the [[2nd century BCE|second century BCE]].&lt;ref name=Prioreschi2004/&gt; Different variations of acupuncture are practiced and taught throughout the world.&lt;ref name = &quot;AAMA list&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|Acupuncture chart from the [[Ming Dynasty]] (c. 1368–1644)|200px]]

===Antiquity===

The earliest written record of acupuncture is the [[China|Chinese]] text ''Shiji'' (史記, English: ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') with elaboration of its history in the 2nd century BCE medical text ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' (黃帝內經, English: ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon'').&lt;ref name = Prioreschi2004/&gt;

Acupuncture's origins in China are uncertain. One explanation is that some soldiers wounded in battle by [[arrow]]s were believed to have been cured of chronic afflictions that were otherwise untreated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tiran | first = D | coauthors = Mack S | title =Complementary therapies for pregnancy and childbirth | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=IuQpoxRFRiIC&amp;pg=PA79 79] | isbn = 0702023280 | publisher = [[Elsevier#Health Sciences|Elsevier Health Sciences]] | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are variations on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book | last =  White | first = A | coauthors = [[Edzard Ernst|Ernst E]] | year = 1999 | title = Acupuncture: a scientific appraisal  | publisher = [[Elsevier#Health Sciences|Elsevier Health Sciences]] | isbn = 0750641630 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=e2KkvlQI7sYC&amp;pg=PA1 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpened stones known as ''Bian shi'' have been found in [[China]], suggesting the practice may date to the [[Neolithic]]&lt;ref name = Chiu&gt;{{cite book | last = Chiu | first = M | year = 1993 | title = Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion | publisher = [[Elsevier#Health Sciences|Elsevier Health Sciences]] | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=V5PAB4d5qmgC&amp;pg=PA2 2] | isbn = 0443042233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly even earlier in the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ma |first1=K.-W. |title=The roots and development of Chinese acupuncture: from prehistory to early 20th century |journal=Acupuncture in Medicine |volume=10 |pages=92–9 |year=1992 |doi=10.1136/aim.10.Suppl.92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] have been found dating from the [[Shang Dynasty]] ([[1600 BCE|1600]]–[[1100 BCE]]) which suggest that acupuncture was practiced along with [[moxibustion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Robson | first = T | title = An Introduction to Complementary Medicine | isbn = 1741140544 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=E6oa37ZyTxEC&amp;pg=PA90 90] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite improvements in [[metallurgy]] over centuries, it was not until the 2nd century BCE during the [[Han Dynasty]] that stone and bone needles were replaced with metal.&lt;ref name = Chiu/&gt; The earliest records of acupuncture is in the ''Shiji'' (史記, in English, ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') with references in later medical texts that are equivocal, but could be interpreted as discussing acupuncture. The earliest Chinese medical text to describe acupuncture is the ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'', the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]]'s ''Classic of Internal Medicine (History of Acupuncture)'' which was compiled around 305–204 BCE.&lt;ref name = Prioreschi2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&amp;pg=PA147 147–8] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1888456019 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Huangdi Neijing'' does not distinguish between acupuncture and moxibustion and gives the same indication for both treatments. The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which also date from the 2nd century BCE (though antedating both the ''Shiji'' and ''Huangdi Neijing''), mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion but not acupuncture. However, by the 2nd century BCE, acupuncture replaced moxibustion as the primary treatment of systemic conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prioreschi2004&quot;/&gt;

In Europe, examinations of the 5,000-year-old mummified body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]] have identified 15 groups of [[tattoo]]s on his body, some of which are located on what are now seen as contemporary acupuncture points. This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in [[Eurasia]] during the early [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorfer |pages=1023–5 |first1=L |last2=Moser |first2=M |last3=Bahr |first3=F |last4=Spindler |first4=K |last5=Egartervigl |first5=E |last6=Giullen |first6=S |last7=Dohr |first7=G |last8=Kenner |first8=T |volume=354 |title=A medical report from the stone age? |year=1999 |journal=The Lancet |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12242-0 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/Iceman_Tattoos.pdf |pmid=10501382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle history ===
[[File:hua t08.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Acupuncture chart from Hua Shou ([[floruit|fl.]] [[1340]]s, [[Ming Dynasty]]). This image from ''Shi si jing fa hui (Expression of the Fourteen Meridians).'' ([[Tokyo]] : Suharaya Heisuke kanko, Kyoho gan [[1716]]).]]

Acupuncture spread from China to [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]] and elsewhere in East Asia.

Around ninety works on acupuncture were written in China between the [[Han Dynasty]] and the [[Song Dynasty]], and the [[Emperor Renzong of Song]], in [[1023]], ordered the production of a bronze statuette depicting the meridians and acupuncture points then in use. However, after the end of the Song Dynasty, acupuncture and its practitioners began to be seen as a technical rather than scholarly profession. It became more rare in the following centuries, supplanted by medications, and became associated with the less prestigious practices of [[shamanism]], [[midwifery]] and moxibustion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 25].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] missionaries in the 16th century were among the first to bring reports of acupuncture to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Unschuld, Paul. Chinese Medicine, p. 94. 1998, Paradigm Publications&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob de Bondt]], a Danish [[surgeon]] traveling in Asia, described the practice in both [[Japan]] and [[Java]]. However, in China itself the practice was increasingly associated with the lower-classes and illiterate practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA58 58–9].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European text on acupuncture was written by [[Willem ten Rhijne]], a Dutch [[physician]] who studied the practice for two years in Japan. It consisted of an essay in a [[1683]] medical text on [[arthritis]]; Europeans were also at the time becoming more interested in moxibustion, which Rhijne also wrote about.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA75 75].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1757]] the physician [[Xu Daqun]] described the further decline of acupuncture, saying it was a lost art, with few experts to instruct; its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA188 188].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1822]], an edict from the Chinese Emperor banned the practice and teaching of acupuncture within the Imperial Academy of Medicine outright, as unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars. At this point, acupuncture was still cited in Europe with both skepticism and praise, with little study and only a small amount of experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA308 308–9].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===
In the early years after the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leaders ridiculed traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, as [[superstitious]], [[irrational]] and backward, claiming that it conflicted with the Party's dedication to [[science]] as the way of progress. Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] later reversed this position, saying that &quot;Chinese medicine and pharmacology are a great treasure house and efforts should be made to explore them and raise them to a higher level.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture gained attention in the United States when President [[Richard Nixon]] visited China in 1972. During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than [[anesthesia]]. Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high [[pain tolerance]] and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving [[morphine]] surreptitiously through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ | title = Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 1) | first = BL | last = Beyerstein | coauthors = Sampson W | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | year = 1996 | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | publisher = [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest exposure in the West came when [[New York Times]] reporter [[James Reston]], who accompanied Nixon during the visit, received acupuncture in China for post-operative pain after undergoing an emergency [[appendectomy]] under standard anesthesia.

In 2006, a [[BBC]] documentary ''Alternative Medicine'' filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture-induced anesthesia. It was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of weak anesthetics that in combination could have a much more powerful effect. The program was also criticized for its fanciful interpretation of the results of a brain scanning experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Singh2008|Singh &amp; Ernst]], 2008, p.

The use of acupuncture as anesthesia for surgery has fallen out of favor with scientifically trained surgeons in China. A delegation of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] reported in 1995: ''We were not shown acupuncture anesthesia for surgery, this apparently having fallen out of favor with scientifically trained surgeons. Dr. Han, for instance, had been emphatic that he and his colleagues see acupuncture only as an analgesic (pain reducer), not an anesthetic (an agent that blocks all conscious sensations).''&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;/&gt;

== Traditional Chinese Medicine theory ==
=== Qi, acupuncture meridians and points ===
{{See also|Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese astrology|Acupuncture point|Meridian (Chinese medicine)}}
[[File:ChineseMedecine.JPG|thumb|rt|200px|Old Chinese medical chart on acupuncture meridians]]

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on a pre-scientific [[paradigm]] of medicine that developed over several thousand years and involves concepts that have no counterpart within contemporary medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt; TCM is based in part on [[Daoism]], with a belief that all parts of the universe are interconnected.&lt;ref name=&quot;acupuncturetoday.com&quot;&gt;[http://acupuncturetoday.com/abc/ The ABCs of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chinese medical classic the [[Su Wen]], [[disease]] is believed to be produced by a failure to live in accord with the [[Dao]]. Within the more systematized teachings of received Chinese medicine there are endogenous, exogenous and miscellaneous causes of disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;essentials&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=anon |author2= |author3= |title=[[Essentials of Chinese Acupuncture]] |publisher=Foreign Languages Press |location=Beijing |year=1980 |edition=1st |pages=39–46 |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in science based medicine disease is attributed to specific (often single) causes, for example bacteria, viruses, or genetic conditions. In contrast to the approach of [[evidence-based medicine]] which is based on the [[germ theory of disease]], [[human anatomy]] and [[human physiology]], Traditional Chinese Medicine attributes disease and pathology to perturbations in the [[Metaphysics(beyond natural law)|metaphysical]] force known as qi (a word variously translated as &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;breath&quot;, or &quot;vital energy&quot;',&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdic Qi&quot;&gt;[http://www.zdic.net/zd/zi/ZdicE6ZdicB0ZdicA3.htm]{{Better source|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and imbalance of [[yin and yang]], and the [[Wu Xing]] (known as the five phases or elements, earth, water, fire, wood and metal).&lt;ref name=FE&gt;{{cite web | title = The Five Elements (Wu Xing) | publisher = Acupuncture.com | url = http://www.acupuncture.com.au/education/theory/thefiveelements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qi'' is believed to flow in and around the body in channels called meridians. Heart-qi is believed to be a force that causes the blood to circulate through the body, whereas in science based medicine the blood is propelled by the heart pumping it. Modern practioners may consider ''qi'' to be no more than a metaphor for function, but many proponents consider it to be an actual 'substance'.

No force corresponding to qi (or yin and yang) has been found in the sciences of [[physics]] or [[human physiology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matuk2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = NIH-1997consensus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;[[Felix Mann]], quoted in {{cite journal |first=M |last=Bauer |url=http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 |journal=Chinese Medicine Times |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=31 |year=2006 |title=The Final Days of Traditional Beliefs? – Part One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TorT52&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahn2008&quot; /&gt; Support for the existence of ''qi'' is often looked for in scientific fields such as [[bioelectricity]]&lt;ref name=&quot;becker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Becker, Robert O. |author2=Selden, Gary |author3= |title=[[The Body Electric]] |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |year=1985 |edition= |pages= |isbn=0-688-06971-1 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this research is rarely verified and the connection with ''qi'' may be spurious.

The location of [[meridians]] is said in the [[Ling Shu]] to be based on the [[List of rivers in China|number of rivers]] flowing through the [[History of China|ancient Chinese empire]], and acupuncture points were originally derived from Chinese [[astrological]] calculations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matuk2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SDAM&gt;''&quot;There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints [or acupoints]...

The anatomical system of TCM divides the body's organs into &quot;hollow&quot; and &quot;solid&quot; organs, for example, the intestines are &quot;hollow&quot;, and the heart or liver are &quot;solid&quot;. It is believed that solid organs are related, and hollow organs are related, and that there is a balance between the two &quot;systems&quot; of organs which is important to health. The ''zang'' systems are associated with the solid ''yin'' organs such as the [[liver]], while the ''fu'' systems are associated with the [[Lumen (anatomy)|hollow ''yang'' organs]] such as the [[intestine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alternativemedicine.healthcommunities.com/tcm/index.shtml Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Communities.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Health is explained as a state of balance between the ''[[yin and yang]]'', with disease ascribed to either of these forces being unbalanced, blocked or stagnant.

It is believed that through birth or early childhood, a “weakness” in one of the five elements develops until it impedes the flow of ''qi'' cycling throughout the body, causing the symptoms of illness. Acupuncture is described as manipulating the qi to restore balance.&lt;ref name=FE/&gt; TCM also links the organs of the body to the stars, planets and [[Chinese astrology|astrological beliefs]] to explain the phenomena of the persistence of health and illness in the human body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unschuld&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Unschuld, Paul U. |title=Nan-Ching, The Classic of Difficult Issues |publisher=University of California Press |year=1986 |pages=3–179 |isbn=9780520053724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blood ===
TCM asserts that blood is propelled by qi, that there 100 blood “vessels are the pathways of the blood’, that the vessels gather at a specific acupuncture point (Taiyuan LU-9) associated with the lung (or lungs), and that when qi flow is not in balance, blood pools and stagnates.&lt;ref&gt;Classic of Difficulties (45th Difficulty)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Classic of Categories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=APDB&gt;Some Acupuncture Points Which Treat Disorders of Blood, Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji, [http://www.acupuncture.com/education/theory/ptsforblood.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern science based medicine has shown that blood is propelled by pumping action of the heart, and that there are many more than 100 blood vessels, that the vessels do not gather at that or any specific point, and that blood doesn't fail to circulate except by failure of pumping by the heart, and does not pool or stagnate except when a vessel is physically blocked or the heart pumping is disrupted.

== Clinical practice ==
[[File:Aiguille d acupuncture avec regle.dsc02265.untilted+cropped+WB.jpg|thumb|150px|One type of acupuncture needle]]

In a modern acupuncture session, an initial consultation is followed by taking the pulse on both arms, and an inspection of the tongue; it is believed that this gives the practitioner a good indication of what is happening inside the body. Classically, in clinical practice, acupuncture is highly individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on controlled scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html |journal=Medical Acupuncture |date=Spring / Summer 2000 |volume=12 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, acupuncture typically lasts from 10 to 60 minutes, with [[diagnosis]] and treatment for a single session ranging from $25 to $80 in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;acupuncture.com.au&quot;&gt;What is involved in an Acupuncture &amp; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment?, About Acupuncture, Acupuncture.com, [http://www.acupuncture.com.au/education/theory/thefiveelements.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes needles are left in the ear for up to 3 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;acupuncture.com.au&quot;/&gt;

=== Needles ===
Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel wire. They are usually disposable, but reusable needles are sometimes used as well, though they must be sterilized between uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Collinge, William J. |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-446-67258-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|to|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needle in more fleshy areas. Needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on|lk=out}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on|lk=out}}, with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.&lt;ref name=FCA&gt;{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=bKoMiuhSb3YC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2–3] | title = Fundamentals of Chinese Acupuncture | last = Ellis | first = A | isbn = 091211133X | publisher = Paradigm Publications | year = 1991 | coauthors = Wiseman N; Boss K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional diagnosis ===

The acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient in order to make a diagnosis according to the tradition which he or she utilizes. In TCM, there are four diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.
*Auscultation and olfaction refer, respectively, to listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing) and attending to body odor.
*Inquiring focuses on the &quot;seven inquiries&quot;, which are: chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].
*Palpation includes feeling the body for tender &quot;ashi&quot; points, and palpation of the left and right radial pulses at two levels of pressure (superficial and deep) and three positions ''Cun, Guan, Chi'' (immediately proximal to the wrist crease, and one and two fingers' breadth proximally, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring fingers).

==== Tongue and pulse====

Examination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in traditional Chinese medicine. The surface of the tongue is believed to contain a map of the entire body, and is used to determine acupuncture points to manipulate. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |publisher=Eastland Press |edition=Revised |date=June 1995 |isbn= |author=Giovanni Maciocia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TCM diagnosis also involves measuring for three superficial and three deep [[pulse]]s at different locations on the [[radial artery]] of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses that are thought to correspond to twelve internal organs.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with terms like &quot;floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick&quot;, which are used to ascribe a specific imbalance in the body.  Learning TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Thomas; Eisenberg, David |title=Encounters with Qi: exploring Chinese medicine |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1995 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=DgFA-kVkuZEC&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 53–4]|isbn=0-393-31213-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific conditions ==
=== Bacterial infection ===
TCM proponents believe acupuncture cures some [[bacterial infection]]s, which they believe are caused by problems in the flow of qi, and base their diagnosis on examination of the tongue and pulse, as well as other symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jin, Hui De; Chou, Chung-ying; Zhou, Zhong Ying; Zhou, Zhongying |title=Clinical manual of Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=1997 |pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=JaFIATxmdoUC&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 207]|isbn=0-443-05128-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1676]], it was discovered that bacterial infections are caused by [[bacteria]], spurring the scientific field of [[bacteriology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Porter JR |title=Antony van Leeuwenhoek: tercentenary of his discovery of bacteria |journal=Bacteriological Reviews |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=260–9 |year=1976 |pmid=786250 |pmc=413956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this discovery, evidence based medicine treats bacterial infections with specific antibiotics targeted to kill the specific bacteria, and base diagnoses on a laboratory analysis to determine the type of bacteria.

A prominent example of this difference appears in an article appearing in the ''Journal of Chinese Medicine'', which describes the cause of bleeding from the mouth and nose as ''&quot;Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;''Some acupuncture points which treat disorders of blood, Journal of Chinese Medicine'', Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji, [http://www.jcm.co.uk/product/catalog/product/view/7937/some-acupuncture-points-which-treat-disorders-of-blood/]&lt;/ref&gt; Science based medicine would look for some other cause, for example, a [[tuberculosis]] bacterial infection, and not consider other causes.

===Reproduction===
Proponents believe acupuncture can assist with fertility, pregnancy and child birth, attributing various conditions of health and difficulty with the flow of qi through various meridians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Isaacs, Lyndsey; West, Zita |title=Acupuncture in pregnancy and childbirth |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-443-10371-2 |oclc= |doi= | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=BhVvDfLypxIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain  ===
Steven E. Braverman published his belief that needling has been successful in treating some pain in the acupuncture journal ''Medical Acupuncture'', which is reviewed by other members of the acupuncture community.&lt;ref name = &quot;AAMA list&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braverman S |title=Medical Acupuncture Review: Safety, Efficacy, And Treatment Practices |journal=Medical Acupuncture |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2004 |url=http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol15_3/article1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that acupuncture may be considered as a [[complementary medicine|complementary therapy]] for various conditions.

== Scientific basis and research on efficacy==

Different types of comparison are made in the scientific literature and terminology can vary, therefore care is needed when assessing research. “Acupuncture” may refer only to insertion of needles in traditionally determined acupuncture points; in which case, it is contrasted with randomly inserting needles, which is called a “sham treatment”, “[[placebo]]”, “needling” or &quot;medical acupuncture&quot; if the points are determined by anatomy and not by TCM. In some sources “acupuncture” refers to random needling with needle insertion, and this is compared to pressing telescoping needles against the skin at the same points but not puncturing the skin, which is called a &quot;sham treatment&quot; or &quot;placebo&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAMA list&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ADNLBP&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furlan |first1=Andrea D. |last2=Van Tulder |first2=Maurits |last3=Cherkin |first3=Dan |last4=Tsukayama |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Lao |first5=Lixing |last6=Koes |first6=Bart |last7=Berman |first7=Brian |title=Acupuncture and Dry-Needling for Low Back Pain: An Updated Systematic Review Within the Framework of the Cochrane Collaboration |journal=Spine |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=944–63 |year=2005 |pmid=15834340 |doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000158941.21571.01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence-based medicine ===

There is scientific agreement that an [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) framework should be used to assess health outcomes and that systematic reviews with strict protocols are essential. Organizations such as the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and [[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] publish such reviews. In practice, EBM is &quot;about integrating individual clinical expertise and the best external evidence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sackett1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sackett |first1=DL |last2=Rosenberg |first2=WM |last3=Gray |first3=JA |last4=Haynes |first4=RB |last5=Richardson |first5=WS |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't. 1996. |journal=Clinical orthopaedics and related research |volume=455 |pages=3–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17340682}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vickers |first1=Andrew J |title=Message to complementary and alternative medicine: evidence is a better friend than power. |journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=1 |pages=1 |year=2001 |pmid=11346455 |pmc=32159 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific disagreement over methodological aspects of research into acupuncture is not uncommon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS_ev&quot;/&gt;

Over the last decade, researcher [[Edzard Ernst]] and colleagues have produced regular [[systematic review]]s of the acupunture literature. In 2007, they concluded that &quot;the emerging clinical evidence seems to imply that acupuncture is effective for some but not all conditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ernst |first1=E. |last2=Pittler |first2=MH |last3=Wider |first3=B |last4=Boddy |first4=K |title=Acupuncture: its evidence-base is changing. |journal=The American Journal of Chinese Medicine |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=21–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17265547 |doi=10.1142/S0192415X07004588}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 review of the literature on pain concluded &quot;numerous systematic reviews have generated little truly convincing evidence that acupuncture is effective in reducing pain.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21440191&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|21440191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.painjournalonline.com/article/S0304-3959(11)00077-7/abstract | title=Acupuncture’s claims punctured: Not proven effective for pain, not harmless | author=Harriet Hall | journal=Pain | volume=152 | issue=4 | pages=711–712 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Review journal|review articles]] discussing the effectiveness of acupuncture have concluded it is possible to explain its effects as a [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst_2006-02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane back 2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madsen2009&quot;/&gt; Evidence for the treatment of psychological conditions other than pain is equivocal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;/&gt;

For acute [[low back pain]] there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either acupuncture or [[dry needling]], though for chronic low back pain acupuncture is more effective than sham treatment but no more effective than conventional and alternative treatments for short-term pain relief and improving function. However, when combined with other conventional therapies, the combination is slightly better than conventional therapy alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane back 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furlan |first1=Andrea D |last2=Van Tulder |first2=Maurits W |last3=Cherkin |first3=Dan |last4=Tsukayama |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Lao |first5=Lixing |last6=Koes |first6=Bart W |last7=Berman |first7=Brian M |editor1-last=Furlan |editor1-first=Andrea D |title=Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain |year=2005 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001351.pub2 |pmid=15674876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Manheimer E, White A, Berman B, Forys K, Ernst E |title=Meta-analysis: acupuncture for low back pain |journal=[[Ann Intern Med]] |volume=142 |issue=8 |pages=651–63 |year=2005 |pmid=15838072 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/142/8/651.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review for the American Pain Society/American College of Physicians found fair evidence that acupuncture is effective for chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17909210&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evanoff |first1=G.

According to the 1997 [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] consensus statement on acupuncture:
{{quote|Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the &quot;acupuncture points&quot;, the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial. Even more elusive is the basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of [[Qi]], the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt;}}

====''Qi'', acupuncture points and meridians ====
[[File:Archie McPhee acupuncture.jpg|thumb|200px|Modern acupuncture model.]]

The locations of acupuncture points were originally based on Chinese astrological considerations.&lt;ref name=AACS/&gt; No research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians.&lt;ref name = &quot;TorT52&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahn2008&quot;/&gt; The [[nervous system]] has been evaluated for a relationship to acupuncture points, but no structures have been clearly linked to them. Controversial studies using [[nuclear medicine|nuclear imaging]] have suggested that tracers may be used to follow meridians and are not related to veins or lymphatic tissues, but the interpretation of these results is unclear. The [[electrical resistance]] of acupuncture points and meridians have also been studied, with conflicting results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahn2008&quot; /&gt;

The meridians are part of the controversy in the efforts to reconcile acupuncture with conventional medicine. The [[National Institutes of Health]] 1997 consensus development statement on acupuncture stated that acupuncture points, Qi, the meridian system and related theories play an important role in the use of acupuncture, but are difficult to relate to a contemporary understanding of the body.&lt;ref name = NIH-1997consensus/&gt; Chinese medicine forbade dissection, and as a result the understanding of how the body functioned was based on a system that related to the world around the body rather than its internal structures. The 365 &quot;divisions&quot; of the body were based on the number of days in a year, and the 12 meridians proposed in the TCM system are thought to be based on the 12 major rivers that run through China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matuk2006&quot; /&gt;

These ancient traditions of Qi and meridians have no counterpart in modern studies of [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[physics]] and to date scientists have been unable to find evidence that supports their existence.&lt;ref name = &quot;TorT52&quot;&gt;[[#Singh2008|Singh &amp; Ernst]], 2008, p.

Acupuncturist [[Felix Mann]], who was the author of the first comprehensive English language acupuncture textbook ''Acupuncture: The Ancient Chinese Art of Healing'' has stated that &quot;The traditional acupuncture points are no more real than the black spots a drunkard sees in front of his eyes&quot; and compared the meridians to the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] of longitude used in geography – an imaginary human construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mann, Felix |title=Reinventing acupuncture: a new concept of ancient medicine |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=ErALnM5c8I4C&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 14]; [http://books.google.com/books?id=ErALnM5c8I4C&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 31] |isbn=0-7506-4857-0 |oclc=44162535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann attempted to join up his medical knowledge with that of Chinese theory. In spite of his protestations about the theory, he was fascinated by it and trained many people in the west with the parts of it he borrowed. He also wrote many books on this subject. His legacy is that there is now a college in London and a system of needling that is known as &quot;Medical Acupuncture&quot;. Today this college trains doctors and western medical professionals only. Reviewers Leonid Kalichman and Simon Vulfsons have described the use of [[dry needling]] of myofascial [[trigger point]]s as an effective and low risk treatment modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=L. |last2=Vulfsons |first2=S. |title=Dry Needling in the Management of Musculoskeletal Pain |journal=The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine |volume=23 |pages=640–6 |year=2010 |doi=10.3122/jabfm.2010.05.090296}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[systematic review]] of acupuncture for pain found that there was no difference between inserting needles into &quot;true&quot; acupuncture on traditional acupuncture points versus &quot;placebo&quot; points not associated with any TCM acupuncture points or meridians. The review concluded that &quot;A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias. Whether needling at acupuncture points, or at any site, reduces pain independently of the psychological impact of the treatment ritual is unclear.&quot;&lt;ref name = Madsen2009/&gt;

A history of medical science article published in the journal Biocommunications states that &quot;the Chinese drew mystical numerical associations, called the Da shu, or “great numbers.” It was no coincidence to the ancient Chinese, for example, that our four limbs matched the number of seasons and directions, and that in the one record of a human dissection on the body of the rebel Wangsun Qing, the hired butchers of his captor, Wang Mang, reported finding five zang (liver, gall bladder, heart, spleen, kidneys) corresponding to the five planets; 12 vessels circulating blood and air corresponding to the 12 rivers flowing toward the Central Kindgom; and 365 parts of the body, one for each day of the year (Lingshu 13/311 ), and the Ling shu cited says “There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints (or acupoints)... There are 12 channel rivers across the land, while humans have 12 channel” – Ling Shu&lt;ref name=&quot;Matuk2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=UNUiHP7MPJMC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22%22traditional+chinese+medicine%22+%2212+rivers%22+acupuncture+%22365+days%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rsClvQps3o&amp;sig=-DGpUyl70Yd4YtHE87RauAe_Q1U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OrJcTcaZOoqcsQO9u5nhCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=12%20rivers&amp;f=false Traditional Chinese Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;

A report for [[CSICOP]] on [[pseudoscience]] in China written by Wallace Sampson and [[Barry Beyerstein]] said:

{{quote|A few Chinese scientists we met maintained that although Qi is merely a metaphor, it is still a useful physiological abstraction (''e.g.'', that the related concepts of [[yin and yang]] parallel modern scientific notions of endocrinologic [sic] and metabolic feedback mechanisms). They see this as a useful way to unite Eastern and Western medicine. Their more hard-nosed colleagues quietly dismissed Qi as only a philosophy, bearing no tangible relationship to modern physiology and medicine.&lt;ref name=Sampson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sampson| first=Wallace I. |year=1996 |month=September/October |title=Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 2) |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=20 |issue=5 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_2/ |accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Possible mechanisms ===

Evidence supports that stimulation of one acupuncture point reduces post-operative nausea and vomiting, although insertion of needles at that point does not increase the reduction over nonpenetrating stimulation,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15266478&quot;/&gt; and [[pain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane back 2005&quot;/&gt; but evidence for the treatment of other conditions is equivocal,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;/&gt; and several [[Review journal|review articles]] discussing the effectiveness of acupuncture have concluded it is possible to explain through the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst_2006-02&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madsen2009&quot;/&gt; Endorphin release, stimulation of the peripheral nervous system, and pain mediation through the effects of other neuropeptides are thought to be the most likely explanations for the effects of the insertion of needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt; [[Publication bias]] is a significant concern when evaluating the literature. Other claims of efficacy have not been tested. Reports from the US [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM), the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and various US government reports have studied and commented on the efficacy (or lack thereof) of acupuncture. There is general agreement that acupuncture is safe when administered by well-trained practitioners using sterile needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCCAM2006-Acupuncture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12801494&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12564354&quot; /&gt; The [[neural]] mechanisms underlying minute pain relief from insertion of needles are unknown, but it has been suggested that it may involve recruitment of the body's own pain reduction system, and an increased release of [[endorphin]]s, [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], or [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid]].&lt;ref name=Sun2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Y. |last2=Gan |first2=T.

=== Efficacy study design ===

One of the major challenges in acupuncture research is in the design of an appropriate [[placebo]] [[control group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12184353&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=A.R. |last2=Filshie |first2=J. |last3=Cummings |first3=T.M. |author4=International Acupuncture Research Forum |title=Clinical trials of acupuncture: consensus recommendations for optimal treatment, sham controls and blinding |journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=237–245 |year=2001 |pmid=12184353 |doi=10.1054/ctim.2001.0489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In trials of new drugs, [[double blinding]] is the accepted standard, but since acupuncture is a procedure rather than a pill, it is difficult to design studies in which both the acupuncturist and patient are blinded as to the treatment being given. The same problem arises in double-blinding procedures used in biomedicine, including virtually all surgical procedures, dentistry, physical therapy, ''etc.'' As the [[Institute of Medicine]] states: &quot;Controlled trials of surgical procedures have been done less frequently than studies of medications because it is much more difficult to standardize the process of surgery. Surgery depends to some degree on the skills and training of the surgeon and the specific environment and support team available to the surgeon. A surgical procedure in the hands of a highly skilled, experienced surgeon is different from the same procedure in the hands of an inexperienced and unskilled surgeon... For many [[Alternative medicine|CAM]] modalities, it is similarly difficult to separate the effectiveness of the treatment from the effectiveness of the person providing the treatment.&quot;&lt;ref name=IOM2005/&gt;{{Rp|126|date=May 2009}} Acupuncture itself is also a very strong placebo, and can provoke extremely high expectations from patients and test subjects; this is particularly problematic for health problems like chronic low back pain, where conventional treatment is often relatively ineffective and may have been unsuccessfully used in the past. In situations like these, it may be inappropriate to consider &quot;conventional care&quot; a proper control intervention for acupuncture since patient expectations for conventional care are quite low.&lt;ref name = &quot;pmid19942631&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Connell |first1=NE |last2=Wand |first2=BM |last3=Goldacre |first3=B |title=Interpretive bias in acupuncture research?: A case study. |journal=Evaluation &amp; the health professions |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=393–409 |year=2009 |pmid=19942631 |doi=10.1177/0163278709353394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blinding of the practitioner in acupuncture remains challenging. One proposed solution to blinding patients has been the development of &quot;sham acupuncture&quot;, ''i.e.'', needling performed superficially or at non-acupuncture sites. Controversy remains over whether, and under what conditions, sham acupuncture may function as a true placebo, particularly in studies on [[pain]], in which insertion of needles anywhere near painful regions may elicit a beneficial response.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16783282&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=M.

Indeed, superficial needle penetration is a common technique in many authentic traditional Japanese acupuncture styles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Annals_2007_Knee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manheimer |first1=E |last2=Linde |first2=K |last3=Lao |first3=L |last4=Bouter |first4=LM |last5=Berman |first5=BM |title=Meta-analysis: acupuncture for osteoarthritis of the knee. |journal=Annals of internal medicine |volume=146 |issue=12 |pages=868–77 |year=2007 |pmid=17577006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of 13 studies of pain treatment with acupuncture, published in January 2009 in the journal ''BMJ'', concluded there was little difference in the effect of real, sham and no acupuncture.&lt;ref name = Madsen2009/&gt;

===Medical organizations===

In 1997, the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs stated:
{{quote|Critics contend that acupuncturists, including many traditionally trained physicians, merely stick needles in patients as a way to offer another form of treatment for which they can be reimbursed, since many insurance companies will do so. Critical reviews of acupuncture summarized by Hafner4 and others19 conclude that no evidence exists that acupuncture affects the course of any disease...Much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious. Well-designed, stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) – Alternative Medicine |url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/no-index/about-ama/13638.shtml |publisher=American Medical Association |year=1997| accessdate=2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also in 1997, the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) issued a consensus statement on acupuncture that concluded that despite research on acupuncture being difficult to conduct, there was sufficient evidence to encourage further study and expand its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH-1997consensus&quot;/&gt;  The consensus statement and conference that produced it were criticized by [[Wallace Sampson]], founder of the ''[[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]]'', writing for an affiliated publication of [[Quackwatch]] who stated the meeting was chaired by a strong proponent of acupuncture and failed to include speakers who had obtained negative results on studies of acupuncture.  Sampson also stated he believed the report showed evidence of [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acuwatch.org/general/nihcritique.shtml | last = Sampson | first = W | title = Critique of the NIH Consensus Conference on Acupuncture | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | accessdate = 2009-06-05 | date = 2005-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 the NIH's [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] stated that it continued to abide by the recommendations of the 1997 NIH consensus statement, even if research is still unable to explain its mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCCAM2006-Acupuncture&quot;/&gt;

In 2003 the [[World Health Organization]]'s Department of Essential Drugs and Medicine Policy produced a report on acupuncture.  The report was drafted, revised and updated by Zhu-Fan Xie, the Director for the Institute of Integrated Medicines of [[Peking University Health Science Center|Beijing Medical University]].  It contained, based on research results available in early 1999, a list of diseases, symptoms or conditions for which it was believed acupuncture had been demonstrated as an effective treatment, as well as a second list of conditions that were possibly able to be treated with acupuncture.  Noting the difficulties of conducting controlled research and the debate on how to best conduct research on acupuncture, the report described itself as &quot;...intended to facilitate research on and the evaluation and application of acupuncture. It is hoped that it will provide a useful resource for researchers, health care providers, national health authorities and the general public.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO 2003.3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2003 |last=World Health Organization |editor=Zhang X |url=http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4926e/#Js4926e.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coordinator for the team that produced the report, Xiaorui Zhang, stated that the report was designed to facilitate research on acupuncture, not recommend treatment for specific diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot; Lancet_WHO_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |title=Critics slam draft WHO report on homoeopathy |journal=The Lancet |volume=366 |pages=705–6 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67159-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report was controversial; critics assailed it as being problematic since, in spite of the disclaimer, supporters used it to claim that the WHO endorsed acupuncture and other alternative medicine practices that were either pseudoscientific or lacking sufficient evidence-basis.  Medical scientists expressed concern that the evidence supporting acupuncture outlined in the report was weak, and Willem Betz of SKEPP (Studie Kring voor Kritische Evaluatie van Pseudowetenschap en het Paranormale, the Study Circle for the Critical Evaluation of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal) said that the report was evidence that the &quot;WHO has been infiltrated by missionaries for [[alternative medicine]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot; Lancet_WHO_2005&quot;/&gt; The WHO 2005 report was also criticized in the 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' for, in addition to being produced by a panel that included no critics of acupuncture at all, containing two major errors – including too many results from low-quality [[clinical trial]]s, and including a large number of trials originating in [[China]] where, probably due to [[publication bias]], no negative trials have ever been produced. In contrast, studies originating in [[Western culture|the West]] include a mixture of positive, negative and neutral results. Ernst and Singh, the authors of the book, described the report as &quot;highly misleading&quot;, a &quot;shoddy piece of work that was never rigorously scrutinized&quot; and stated that the results of high-quality clinical trials do not support the use of acupuncture to treat anything but pain and nausea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Singh2008|Singh &amp; Ernst]], 2008, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&amp;pg=PA277 277-8].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Health Service]] of the [[United Kingdom]] states that there is &quot;reasonably good evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment&quot; for nausea, vomiting, osteoarthritis of the knee and several types of pain but &quot;because of disagreements over the way acupuncture trials should be carried out and over what their results mean, this evidence does not allow us to draw definite conclusions&quot;. The NHS states there is evidence against acupuncture being useful for rheumatoid arthritis, smoking cessation and weight loss, and inadequate evidence for most other conditions that acupuncture is used for.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS_ev&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Acupuncture/Pages/Evidence.aspx |title=Acupuncture: Evidence for its effectiveness |accessdate=2010-08-10 |date=2010-03-18 |publisher=[[National Health Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Because acupuncture needles penetrate the skin, many forms of acupuncture are [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] procedures, and therefore not without risk. Injuries are rare among patients treated by trained practitioners in some countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12564354&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lao L, Hamilton GR, Fu J, Berman BM |title=Is acupuncture safe?
