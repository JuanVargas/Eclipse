'''Ancient Egypt''' was an [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[civilization]] of eastern [[North Africa]], concentrated along the lower reaches of the [[Nile|Nile River]] in what is now the modern country of [[Egypt]]. 

Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150&amp;nbsp;BC (according to [[conventional Egyptian chronology]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/index.html|title=Chronology|accessdate=25 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the political unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] under the first [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (2004) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[history of ancient Egypt]] occurred in a series of stable ''Kingdoms'', separated by periods of relative instability known as ''Intermediate Periods''. The [[Old Kingdom]] of the [[Early Bronze Age]], the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] and the [[New Kingdom]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]]. Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the [[Ramesside period]], after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was conquered by a succession of foreign powers in this late period. In the aftermath of [[Alexander the Great]]'s death, one of his generals, [[Ptolemy Soter]], established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]] ruled Egypt until 30&amp;nbsp;BC, when it fell to the [[Roman Empire]] and became [[Egypt (Roman province)|a Roman province]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River Valley. The predictable flooding and controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which fueled [[social development]] and culture. With resources to spare, the [[administration (government)|administration]] sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|writing system]], the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to [[Military history of Ancient Egypt|defeat foreign enemies]] and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite [[Egyptian writing|scribe]]s, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a Pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that facilitated the building of monumental [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], [[Egyptian temple|temples]], and [[obelisk]]s; a system of [[Egyptian mathematics|mathematics]], a practical and effective [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|system of medicine]], irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt; [[Egyptian faience]] and glass technology, new forms of [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], and the earliest known peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period led to the [[Egyptology|scientific investigation]] of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy, for Egypt and the world.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{History of Egypt}}{{Small Egyptian Dynasty List}}
{{Main|History of ancient Egypt|History of Egypt|Population history of Egypt}}

By the late [[Paleolithic]] period the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the Nile valley, and since nomadic [[Anatomically modern humans|modern human]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s began living in the region through the end of the [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] some 120&amp;nbsp;thousand years ago, the Nile has been the lifeline of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 17, 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predynastic period===
{{Main|Predynastic Egypt}}
In Predynastic and [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic]] times, the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed [[savanna]] and traversed by herds of grazing [[ungulates]]. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first [[Domestication|domesticated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Egypte louvre 316.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A typical Naqada II jar decorated with gazelles. (Predynastic Period)]]
By about [[6th millennium BC|5500 BC]], small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper Egypt, the [[Badari]], was known for its high quality ceramics, [[stone tool]]s, and its use of copper.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1964) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Egypt, the Badari was followed by [[Amratian culture|Amratian]] and [[Gerzean culture|Gerzean]] cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. Gordon (1953), &quot;New light on the most ancient Near East&quot; (Praeger Publications)&lt;/ref&gt; which brought a number of technological improvements. In Gerzian times, early evidence exists of contact with [[Canaan]] and the [[Byblos]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;Patai, Raphael (1998), &quot;Children of Noah: Jewish Seafaring in Ancient Times&quot; (Princeton Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern Egypt, the [[Naqada]] culture, similar to the Badari, began to expand along the Nile by about [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]]. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported [[obsidian]] from [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], used to shape blades and other objects from [[Lithic flake|flakes]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara G. Aston, James A. Harrell, Ian Shaw (2000). Paul T. Nicholson and Ian Shaw editors. &quot;Stone,&quot; in ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology,'' Cambridge, 5–77, pp. 46–47. Also note: Barbara G. Aston (1994). &quot;Ancient Egyptian Stone Vessels,&quot; ''Studien zur Archäologie und Geschichte Altägyptens'' 5, Heidelberg, pp. 23–26. (See on-line posts: [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/stone/obsidian.html] and [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/obsidian.html].)&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians also imported myrrh from an ancient Ethiopian civilization they referred to as &quot;[[Punt]]&quot;. The Egyptians sometimes called Punt land Ta-Netjeru, meaning &quot;Land of the Gods,&quot; and considered it their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to The End of the 18th century'' (Asmara: Red Sea Press, Inc., 1997), pp.5, 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/naqadan/chronology.html#naqadaI|title=Chronology of the Naqada Period|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a power center at [[Nekhen|Hierakonpolis]], and later at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the [[Nile Delta|Nile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw61&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; They also traded with [[Nubia]] to the south, the oases of the [[Libyan Desert|western desert]] to the west, and the cultures of the [[eastern Mediterranean]] to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw61&quot; /&gt;

The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, which included painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, cosmetic palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a [[ceramic glaze]] known as [[Egyptian faience|faience]], which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/faience/periods.html|title=Faience in different Periods|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually evolved into a full system of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] for writing the ancient Egyptian language.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Dynastic Period===

[[File:NarmerPalette ROM-gamma.jpg|thumb|The [[Narmer Palette]] depicts the unification of the Two Lands.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Early Dynastic Period of Egypt}}

The 3rd century BC Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] grouped the long line of pharaohs from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to begin his official history with the king named &quot;Meni&quot; (or [[Menes]] in Greek) who was then believed to have united the two kingdoms of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]] (around 3100 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to a unified state actually happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have actually been the pharaoh [[Narmer]], who is depicted wearing [[Regalia|royal regalia]] on the ceremonial Narmer Palette in a symbolic act of unification.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150&amp;nbsp;BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified their control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], from which they could control the [[labor force]] and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical [[trade route]]s to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate [[mastaba]] tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labor, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Kingdom===

{{Main|Old Kingdom}}

[[File:Menkaura-ColossalStatue MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|upright|Alabaster statue of [[Menkaura]] at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]]]

Stunning advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the [[Old Kingdom]], fueled by the increased [[agricultural productivity]] made possible by a well-developed central administration.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of the [[vizier]], state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve [[crop yield]], drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a [[Criminal law|justice system]] to maintain peace and order.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; With the surplus resources made available by a productive and stable economy, the state was able to sponsor construction of colossal monuments and to commission exceptional works of art from the royal workshops. The pyramids built by [[Djoser]], [[Khufu]], and their descendants are the most memorable symbols of ancient Egyptian civilization, and the power of the pharaohs that controlled it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. By the end of the Old Kingdom, five centuries of these feudal practices had slowly eroded the [[economic power]] of the pharaoh, who could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 116–7&lt;/ref&gt; As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with [[4.2 kiloyear event|severe droughts]] between 2200 and 2150&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/apocalypse_egypt_04.shtml |title=The Fall of the Old Kingdom |author=Fekri Hassan|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately caused the country to enter a 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Intermediate Period===
{{Main|First Intermediate Period of Egypt}}
After Egypt's [[central government]] collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—a fact demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the [[optimism]] and originality of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw146&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Free from their loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and [[political power]]. By 2160&amp;nbsp;BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the [[Intef I|Intef family]], took control of Upper Egypt. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055&amp;nbsp;BC the Theban forces under [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands and inaugurating a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Kingdom===

{{Main|Middle Kingdom of Egypt}}

[[File:Egypte louvre 231 visage.jpg|thumb|upright|Amenemhat III, the last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom]]

The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's prosperity and stability, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Mentuhotep II and his 11th Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier [[Amenemhat I]], upon assuming kingship at the beginning of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] around 1985&amp;nbsp;BC, shifted the nation's capital to the city of [[Itjtawy]] located in [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; From Itjtawy, the pharaohs of the 12th Dynasty undertook a far-sighted [[land reclamation]] and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in Nubia rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the &quot;[[Walls-of-the-Ruler]]&quot;, to defend against foreign attack.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Having secured military and political security and vast agricultural and mineral wealth, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in expressions of personal piety and what could be called a [[democratization]] of the afterlife, in which all people possessed a soul and could be welcomed into the company of the gods after death.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) pp. 179–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw146&quot;/&gt; and the [[relief]] and portrait sculpture of the period captured
subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, [[Amenemhat III]], allowed Asiatic settlers into the delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with inadequate [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later 13th and 14th dynasties. During this decline, the foreign Asiatic settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the [[Hyksos]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Intermediate Period and the Hyksos===

{{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}}

Around 1785&amp;nbsp;BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, Asiatic immigrants living in the Eastern Delta town of [[Avaris]] seized control of the region and forced the central government to retreat to Thebes, where the pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryholt310&quot;&gt;Ryholt (1997) p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyksos (&quot;foreign rulers&quot;) imitated Egyptian models of government and portrayed themselves as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze Age]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

After their retreat, the Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Hyksos to the north and the Hyksos' Nubian allies, the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]], to the south. After years of inaction tenuous, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555&amp;nbsp;BC &lt;ref name=&quot;Ryholt310&quot;/&gt; The pharaohs [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and [[Kamose]] were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians, but it was Kamose's successor, [[Ahmose I]], who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt’s borders and secure her complete dominance of the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egypt NK edit.svg|upright|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of Ancient Egypt (15th century BC)]]

===New Kingdom===

{{Main|New Kingdom}}

The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbors. Military campaigns waged under [[Thutmose I|Tuthmosis I]] and his grandson [[Thutmose III|Tuthmosis III]] extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.  When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC, Egypt extended from [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]] in north Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as [[bronze]] and wood.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god [[Amun]], whose growing cult was based in [[Karnak]]. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The female pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] used such propaganda to legitimize her claim to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/hatshepsut.html |title=Hatshepsut|accessdate=9 December 2007 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her successful reign was marked by trading expeditions to [[Land of Punt|Punt]], an elegant [[mortuary temple]], a colossal pair of obelisks and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III sought to erase her legacy near the end of his reign, possibly in retaliation for usurping his throne.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFEC EGYPT ABUSIMBEL 2006-003.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Four colossal statues of [[Ramesses II]] flank the entrance of his temple [[Abu Simbel]].]]

Around 1350&amp;nbsp;BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to [[Akhenaten]], he touted the previously obscure [[Solar deity|sun god]] [[Aten]] as the [[God|supreme deity]], suppressed the worship of other deities, and attacked the power of the priestly establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred (1988) p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day [[Amarna]]), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to foreign affairs and absorbed himself in his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, and the subsequent pharaohs [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ay]], and [[Horemheb]] erased all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the [[Amarna Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Cline (2001) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1279&amp;nbsp;BC, Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.&lt;ref&gt;From his two principal wives and large harem, Ramesses II sired more than 100 children. Clayton (1994) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the [[Hittites]] in the [[Battle of Kadesh]] and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around 1258&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley (2001) pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]] and the [[Sea Peoples]]. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of Syria and Palestine. The impact of external threats was exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery and civil unrest. The high priests at the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|temple of Amun]] in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their growing power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Third Intermediate Period map.svg|thumb|upright|Around 730 BC Libyans from the west fractured the political unity of the country.]]

=== Third Intermediate Period ===

{{Main|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}

Following the death of [[Ramesses XI]] in 1078 BC, [[Smendes]] assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]]. The south was effectively controlled by the [[Theban High Priests of Amun (21st and 22nd Dynasty)|High Priests of Amun at Thebes]], who recognized Smendes in name only.&lt;ref&gt;Cerny (1975) p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under [[Shoshenq I]] in 945 BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]], and [[Cushi|Kushites]] threatened from the south. Around 727&amp;nbsp;BC the Kushite king [[Piye]] invaded northward, seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the [[Assyria]]n sphere of influence, and by 700&amp;nbsp;BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667&amp;nbsp;BC the Assyrians began their attack on Egypt. The reigns of both Kushite kings [[Taharqa]] and his successor, [[Tantamani|Tanutamun]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom the Nubian rulers enjoyed several victories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_07_assyro.htm &quot;The Kushite Conquest of Egypt&quot;, ''Ancient~Sudan: Nubia''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and sacked the temples of Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Period===
{{Main|Late Period of ancient Egypt}}
With no permanent plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Sixth Dynasty]]. By 653&amp;nbsp;BC, the Saite king [[Psamtik I]] was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of [[Naucratis|Naukratis]] became the home of Greeks in the delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525&amp;nbsp;BC, the powerful Persians, led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the battle of [[Pelusium]]. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of [[Susa]], leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with [[Cyprus]] and [[Phoenicia]] in the sixth [[satrap]]y of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh dynasty, ended in 402&amp;nbsp;BC, and from 380–343&amp;nbsp;BC the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt, which ended with the kingship of [[Nectanebo II]]. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the Thirty-First Dynasty, began in 343&amp;nbsp;BC, but shortly after, in 332&amp;nbsp;BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to [[Alexander the Great]] without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ptolemaic Dynasty===
{{Main|History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty}}
In 332 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Ptolemies, was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Alexandria]]. The city showcased the power and prestige of Greek rule, and became a [[Seat of Wisdom|seat of learning]] and culture, centered at the famous [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city&amp;mdash;as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian gods]] were [[Syncretic religion|syncretized]] into composite deities, such as [[Serapis]], and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful Syrian opponents made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman domination===

{{Main|History of Roman Egypt}}

[[File:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|left|100px|upright|The [[Fayum mummy portraits]] epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures.]]

Egypt became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, following the defeat of [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] by [[Augustus|Octavian]] (later [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] Augustus) in the [[Battle of Actium]]. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the [[Roman legion|Roman army]], under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw422&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some of the Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw422&quot;/&gt;

From the mid-1st century, Christianity took root in Alexandria as it was seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from [[paganism]] and threatened the popular religious traditions. This led to persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of [[Diocletian]] starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2003) p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; In 391 the Christian Emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Church in Ancient Society''&quot;, [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], p. 373, Oxford University Press US, 2001, ISBN 0-19-924695-5&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D 100–400&quot;'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]], p. 63, Yale University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-300-03216-1&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Egypt's pagan culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak [[Egyptian language|their language]], the ability to read [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and economy==
===Administration and commerce===

[[File:Pharaoh.svg|thumb|upright|The pharaoh was usually depicted wearing symbols of royalty and power.]]

The [[pharaoh]] was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme [[Commander|military commander]] and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the [[vizier]], who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] each governed by a [[nomarch]], who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The [[Egyptian temple|temples]] formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nation's wealth in a system of [[granary|granaries]] and treasuries administered by overseers, who redistributed grain and goods.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use [[Currency|coinage]] until the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late period]], they did use a type of money-barter system,&lt;ref&gt;Meskell (2004) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; with standard sacks of grain and the ''[[Deben (unit)|deben]]'', a weight of roughly {{convert|91|g|oz|0}} of copper or silver, forming a common denominator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian372&quot;&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5½&amp;nbsp;sacks (200&amp;nbsp;kg or 400&amp;nbsp;lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn 7½&amp;nbsp;sacks (250&amp;nbsp;kg or 550&amp;nbsp;lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140&amp;nbsp;deben.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian372&quot;/&gt; Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian372&quot;/&gt; During the 5th century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of [[precious metal]] rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Walbank (1984) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social status===
Egyptian society was highly stratified, and [[social status]] was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or [[Nobility|noble family]] that owned the land.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a [[corvée]] system.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, the so-called &quot;white kilt class&quot; in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.&lt;ref&gt;Billard (1978) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. [[Slavery]] was known in ancient Egypt, but the extent and prevalence of its practice are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/social/index.html |title=Social classes in ancient Egypt |accessdate=11 December 2007 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes except slaves, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the [[vizier]] and his court for redress.&lt;ref name=UCJohnson/&gt; Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as [[God's Wife of Amun|Divine Wives of Amun]]. Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, served only secondary roles in the temples, and were not as likely to be as educated as men.&lt;ref name=UCJohnson/&gt; Also see a BBC History article online for more information on [[gender equality]] in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/women_01.shtml A maintained BBC History article by Dr. Joann Fletcher (last updated 5Nov2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louvre-antiquites-egyptiennes-p1020372 Cropped and bg reduced.png|thumb|left|upright|Scribes were elite and well educated. They assessed taxes, kept records, and were responsible for administration.]]

===Legal system===
The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;/&gt; Although no [[legal code]]s from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCJohnson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777190170/|title=Women's Legal Rights in Ancient Egypt|accessdate=31 August 2010|publisher=University of Chicago, 2004| author=Janet H. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local councils of elders, known as ''Kenbet'' in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;/&gt; More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the ''Great Kenbet'', over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes (2003) p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian358&quot;/&gt; Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[oracle]]s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an [[ostracon]].&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (1999) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

[[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields, harvesting the crops, and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer.]]

A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich [[fertile soil]] resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''Akhet'' (flooding), ''Peret'' (planting), and ''Shemu'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain. [[Winnowing]] removed the [[chaff]] from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians cultivated [[emmer]] and [[barley]], and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flax]] plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food.]]

====Animals====

The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal117&quot;&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Animals, both [[Domestication|domesticated]] and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry such as ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian381&quot;&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and they provided both honey and wax.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and [[oxen]] as [[Working animal|beasts of burden]], and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian381&quot;/&gt; Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, and the camel, although known from the New Kingdom, was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that [[elephant]]s were briefly utilized in the Late Period, but largely abandoned due to lack of [[grazing]] land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelian381&quot;/&gt; Dogs, cats and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as lions, were reserved for royalty. [[Herodotus]] observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal117&quot;/&gt; During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]] and the ibis god [[Thoth]], and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes (2003) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
{{See|Mining in Egypt}}
Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These [[natural resource]]s allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and [[fashion jewelry]].&lt;ref&gt;Greaves (1929) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embalming|Embalmers]] used salts from the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] for [[mummy|mummification]], which also provided the [[gypsum]] needed to make plaster.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas (1962) p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; Ore-bearing [[rock formation]]s were found in distant, inhospitable [[wadi]]s in the [[Arabian Desert|eastern desert]] and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive [[Gold mining|gold mines]] in [[Nubia]], and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The [[Wadi Hammamat]] was a notable source of granite, [[greywacke]], and gold. [[Flint]] was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as [[sulfur]] as cosmetic substances.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulfur?topic=49557 ''Sulfur''. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians worked deposits of the [[Lead|lead ore]] [[galena]] at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from [[malachite]] ore mined in the Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;Scheel (1989) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in [[Alluvium|alluvial deposits]], or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], greywacke, [[alabaster]], and [[carnelian]] dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of [[emerald]]s in Wadi Sikait and [[amethyst]] in Wadi el-Hudi.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===

The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their [[Foreign contacts of ancient Egypt|foreign neighbors]] to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]], they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; An Egyptian [[colony]] stationed in southern [[Canaan]] dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Porat and Edwin van den Brink (editor), &quot;An Egyptian Colony in Southern Palestine During the Late Predynastic to Early Dynastic,&quot; in ''The Nile Delta in Transition: 4th to 3rd Millennium BC'' (1992), pp. 433–440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narmer]] had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Naomi&quot;&gt;Naomi Porat, &quot;Local Industry of Egyptian Pottery in Southern Palestine During the Early Bronze I Period,&quot; in ''Bulletin of the Egyptological, Seminar 8'' (1986/1987), pp. 109–129. See also [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/1stdynegyppotsinpalestine.html University College London web post, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian trade with [[Byblos]] yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt relied on trade with [[Anatolia]] for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone [[lapis lazuli]], which had to be imported from far-away [[Afghanistan]]. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of [[olive oil]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1990) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian language]] is a northern [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language closely related to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Semitic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137&lt;/ref&gt; It has the second longest history of any language (after [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]), having been written from c. 3200&amp;nbsp;BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of Ancient Egyptian are [[Old Egyptian]], [[Middle Egyptian]] (Classical Egyptian), [[Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian was a [[synthetic language]], but it became more [[Analytic language|analytic]] later on. Late Egyptian develops prefixal definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|articles]], which replace the older inflectional [[Grammatical case|suffixes]]. There is a change from the older [[Verb Subject Object]] [[word order]] to [[Subject Verb Object]].&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137-38&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], [[hieratic]], and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic [[Coptic alphabet]]. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Orthodox Church]], and traces of it are found in modern [[Egyptian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Vittman (1991) pp. 197–227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sounds and grammar===

Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]] consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and voiced and voiceless [[Affricate consonant|affricates]]. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Later Egyptian to about nine.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995a) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a [[Semitic root|triliteral]] or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the [[Grammatical person|person]]. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton '''{{transl|egy|S-Ḏ-M}}''' is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is ''{{transl|egy|sḏm=f}}'' 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (1995a) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{transl|egy|sḏm ḥmt}}'' 'the woman hears'.

Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call ''[[Arabic grammar|nisba]]tion'' because of its similarity with Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The word order is &lt;small&gt;PREDICATE-SUBJECT&lt;/small&gt; in verbal and adjectival sentences, and &lt;small&gt;SUBJECT-PREDICATE&lt;/small&gt; in nominal and adverbial sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) pp. 67, 70, 109&lt;/ref&gt; The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2005) p. 2147&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs and nouns are negated by the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''n'', but ''nn'' is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===

{{Main|Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieratic}}

[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Rosetta Stone|Rosetta stone]] (ca 196 BC) enabled linguists to begin the process of hieroglyph decipherment.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphic writing]] dates to c. 3200&amp;nbsp;BC, and is composed of some 500 symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called [[hieratic]], which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Around the 1st century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified [[Greek alphabet]] with the addition of some Demotic signs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the 4th century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno (2004) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and Islamic periods in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly (2005) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{Main|Ancient Egyptian literature}}

[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith surgical papyrus]] (ca 16th century BC) describes anatomy and medical treatments and is written in hieratic.]]

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the ''Per Ankh'' institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.&lt;ref&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the [[Pyramid Texts|Pyramid]] and [[Coffin Texts]], were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300&amp;nbsp;BC. Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside]] administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of [[Harkhuf]] and [[Weni the Elder|Weni]]. The genre known as ''[[Sebayt]]'' (''Instructions'') was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the [[Ipuwer Papyrus|Ipuwer papyrus]], a poem of lamentations describing [[natural disaster]]s and social upheaval, is a famous example.

The [[Story of Sinuhe]], written in [[Middle Egyptian]], might be the classic of Egyptian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim (1975) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Also written at this time was the [[Westcar Papyrus]], a set of stories told to [[Khufu]] by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim (1975) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Instruction of Amenemope]] is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Wisdom in Ancient Israel&quot;'', John Day,/John Adney Emerton,/Robert P. Gordon/ Hugh Godfrey/Maturin Williamson, p23, Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-521-62489-4&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the [[Late Egyptian|vernacular language]] was more often employed to write popular pieces like the [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instruction of Any]]. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the [[Greco-Roman|Graeco-Roman]] period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim (1980) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LowClassAncientEgyptianStatuettes.png|thumb|Statues depicting lower-class Ancient Egyptian occupations.]]

[[File:Ägyptischer Maler um 1400 v. Chr. 001.jpg|thumb|The ancient Egyptians maintained a rich cultural heritage complete with feasts and festivals accompanied by music and dance.]]

Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of [[Mudbrick|mud-brick]] designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling flour and a small oven for baking bread.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from [[animal fat]] and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness, and aromatic perfumes and ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 406–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, and drums and imported [[lute]]s and [[lyre]]s from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/furniture/music.html|title=Music in Ancient Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sistrum]] was a rattle-like [[musical instrument]] that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. [[Senet]], a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was [[mehen (game)|mehen]], which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and [[ball game]]s were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at [[Beni Hasan]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers village of [[Deir el-Madinah]] has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community can be studied in such detail.&lt;ref&gt;“''The Cambridge Ancient History: II Part I , The Middle East and the Aegean Region, c.1800-13380 B.C”'', Edited I.E.S Edwards–C.JGadd–N.G.L Hammond-E.Sollberger, Cambridge at the University Press, p. 380, 1973, ISBN 0-521-08230-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
&lt;!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' --&gt;
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian cuisine}}
Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed, the [[Egyptian cuisine|cuisine of modern Egypt]] retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 399–400&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:S F-E-CAMERON EGYPT 2006 FEB 00289.JPG|thumb|The well preserved [[Temple of Edfu|Temple of Horus at Edfu]] is an exemplar of Egyptian architecture.]]
The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Karnak|temples at Thebes]]. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large [[stone structures]] with accuracy and precision.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) pp. 94–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in [[Malkata]] and [[Amarna]], show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;Badawy (1968) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, [[Djoser]]'s mortuary complex, include [[post and lintel]] supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.

The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples, such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]], the open courtyard, and the enclosed [[hypostyle]] hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Graeco-Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/temple/typestime.html|title=Types of temples in ancient Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the [[mastaba]], a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground [[Chamber tomb|burial chamber]]. The [[step pyramid]] of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (1991) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===

[[File:Nefertiti 30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nefertiti bust|The Bust of Nefertiti]], by the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]], is one of the most famous masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.]]
{{Main|Art of Ancient Egypt}}
The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500&amp;nbsp;years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The [[Narmer Palette]], for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1997) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (2001) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone to carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with [[gum arabic]] as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Pharaohs used [[relief]]s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of [[funerary art]], such as [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;&gt;James (2005) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style frescoes were found in [[Avaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to [[Akhenaten]]'s revolutionary religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; This style, known as [[Amarna art]], was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
&lt;!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' --&gt;

{{Main|Ancient Egyptian religion}}

[[File:BD Hunefer.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Book of the Dead]] was a guide to the deceased's journey in the afterlife.]]

Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]] and stories into a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology''&quot;, edited by [[Donald B. Redford]], p. 106, Berkley, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Ka statue]] provided a physical place for the Ka to manifest.]]

Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the king's behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw313&quot;&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''šwt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2000) pp. 79, 94–5&lt;/ref&gt; The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the &quot;blessed dead&quot;, living on as an ''akh'', or &quot;effective one&quot;. For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a &quot;feather of truth&quot;. If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, ''et al.'' (1994) pp. 150–3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tutmask.jpg|thumb|upright|Pharaohs' tombs were provided with vast quantities of wealth, such as this golden mask from the mummy of [[Tutankhamun]].]]

===Burial customs===
&lt;!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' --&gt;
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}
The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by [[Mummy|mummification]], performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;/&gt; Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by [[desiccation]]. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in [[canopic jar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/ok.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Old Kingdom|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anubis attending the mummy of Sennedjem.jpg|thumb|left|Anubis was the ancient Egyptian god associated with mummification and burial rituals; here, he attends to a mummy.]]

By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70&amp;nbsp;days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called [[natron]]. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Late Period, Ptolemaic, Roman and Christian Period |accessdate=9 March 2008 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[Book of the Dead|books of the dead]] were included in the grave, along with [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/shabtis.html|title=Shabtis|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;James (2005) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===

{{Main|Military history of Ancient Egypt}}

[[File:Egyptian-Chariot.png|thumb|right|An Egyptian [[chariot]].]]

The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the [[ancient Near East]]. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of [[Buhen]] on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the [[Levant]]. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and parts of the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical military equipment included [[Bow (weapon)|bows and arrows]], spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching [[Leather|animal skin]] over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using [[Chariotry in Ancient Egypt|chariots]] that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the [[Khopesh]] was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Manuelian (1998) pp. 366–67&lt;/ref&gt; The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army, and there is evidence that at least a few pharaohs, such as [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and his sons, did do so.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (1994) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology, medicine, and mathematics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Civilization]] --&gt;

===Technology===
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian technology}}
In technology, medicine and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional [[empiricism]], as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers Papyrus|Ebers papyri]] (c. 1600&amp;nbsp;BC), is first credited to Egypt, and the roots of the [[History of scientific method|scientific method]] can also be traced back to the ancient Egyptians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The Egyptians created their own alphabet and [[decimal|decimal system]].
[[File:Egyptian glass jar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassmaking was a highly developed art.]]

===Faience and glass===
Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as [[Egyptian faience|faience]], which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], small amounts of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] and [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and a colorant, typically copper.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as [[Egyptian blue|Egyptian Blue]], also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or [[sintering]]) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding [[Micromineral|trace elements]] to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2000) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}
[[File:Ancient Egyptian medical instruments.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the temple at Kom Ombo.]]
The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from [[malaria]] and debilitating [[schistosomiasis]] parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The life-long labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to [[abscess]]es (though [[dental caries|caries]] were rare).&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted [[Periodontitis|periodontal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Adult [[life expectancy]] was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Figures are given for ''adult'' life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy ''at birth.'' Filer (1995) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, like [[Imhotep]], remained famous long after their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.&lt;ref&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Training of physicians took place at the ''Per Ankh'' or &quot;House of Life&quot; institution, most notably those headquartered in [[Bubastis|Per-Bastet]] during the New Kingdom and at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] and [[Sais, Egypt|Saïs]] in the Late period. [[Medical papyri]] show [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|empirical knowledge]] of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Stroual (1989) pp. 244–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,&lt;ref&gt;Stroual (1989) p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; while opium was used to relieve pain. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve [[asthma]] symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set [[Broken Bones|broken bones]], and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until he died.&lt;ref&gt;Filer (1995) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shipbuilding===
{{Main|Shipbuilding}}
Early [[Egyptians]] knew how to assemble planks of wood into a [[hull (ship)|ship hull]] as early as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC. The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] reports&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;&gt;Ward, Cheryl. &quot;[http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html World's Oldest Planked Boats]&quot;, in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). Archaeological Institute of America.&lt;/ref&gt; that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the [[Ancient Egyptian Boats (First Dynasty) - Abydos|Abydos boats]]. These are a group of 14 discovered ships in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] that were constructed of wooden planks &quot;sewn&quot; together. Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of [[New York University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot;&gt;Schuster, Angela M.H. &quot;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/abydos.html This Old Boat]&quot;, 11 December 2000. Archaeological Institute of America.&lt;/ref&gt; woven [[strap]]s were found to have been used to lash the planks together,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot; /&gt; and [[Cyperus papyrus|reeds]] or [[grass]] stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot; /&gt; Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to [[Khasekhemwy|Pharaoh Khasekhemwy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot; /&gt; originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot; /&gt; and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot; /&gt; The ship dating to 3000&amp;nbsp;BC was {{convert|75|ft|m}} long&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot; /&gt; and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot; /&gt; According to professor O'Connor, the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to [[Hor-Aha|Pharaoh Aha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA2&quot; /&gt;

Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with [[treenail]]s to fasten them together, using [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[caulking]] the seams. The &quot;[[Khufu ship]]&quot;, a 43.6-meter vessel sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a [[solar barque]]. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with [[mortise and tenon]] joints.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot; /&gt; Despite the ancient Egyptian's ability to construct very large boats to sail along the easily navigable Nile, they were not known as good sailors and did not engage in widespread sailing or shipping in the Mediterranean or Red Seas.

=== Mathematics ===

{{Main|Egyptian mathematics}}

The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic [[Naqada]] period, and show a fully developed [[numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;Understanding of Egyptian mathematics is incomplete due to paucity of available material and lack of exhaustive study of the texts that have been uncovered. Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor and grain.&lt;ref&gt;Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, circles and even spheres{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. They understood basic concepts of [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], and could solve simple sets of [[simultaneous equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hiero | {{frac|2|3}} | &lt;hiero&gt;D22&lt;/hiero&gt;| align=right| era=default}}

[[Mathematical notation]] was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write [[Egyptian fraction|fractions]] as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction ''two-fifths'' into the sum of ''one-third'' + ''one-fifteenth''. Standard tables of values facilitated this.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1990) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Vulgar fraction|common fractions]], however, were written with a special glyph&amp;mdash;the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner (1957) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had a grasp of the principles underlying the [[Pythagorean theorem]], knowing, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the [[hypotenuse]] when its sides were in a 3–4–5 ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal241&quot;&gt;Strouhal (1989) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to estimate the area of a [[circle]] by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:

:Area ≈ [({{frac|8|9}})''D'']&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ({{frac|256|81}})''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3.16''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

a reasonable approximation of the formula '''[[Pi|π]]'''''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strouhal241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[golden ratio]] seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (1989) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

{{See also|Tourism in Egypt}}

[[File:Camel and the pyramids.jpg|thumb|250px|Tourists riding a [[bactrian camel]] in front of [[Pyramid of Khafre]]. [[Giza]] Pyramids are one of [[Tourism in Egypt|Egypt's most popular tourist]] draws.]]

The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess [[Isis]], for example, became popular in the [[Roman Empire]], as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans also imported [[building material]]s from Egypt to erect Egyptian style structures. Early historians such as [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later [[Islam]], but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[al-Maqrizi]].&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly (2005) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of [[Egyptomania]] across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the European [[colonialism|colonial]] occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners had more positive results. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], for example, arranged the first studies in [[Egyptology]] when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's [[natural history]], which was published in the ''[[Description de l'Égypte|Description de l'Ėgypte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti (1998) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.

'''Analog Brothers''' is an experimental hip-hop crew featuring Ice Oscillator also known as [[Ice-T]] (keyboards, drums, vocals), Keith Korg also known as [[Kool Keith]] (bass, strings, vocals), Mark Moog also known as Marc Live (drums, ''violyns'' and vocals), Silver Synth also known as Black Silver (synthesizer, lazar bell and vocals), and Rex Roland also known as Pimp Rex (keyboards, vocals, production). Its album ''Pimp to Eat'' featured guest appearances by various members of [[Rhyme Syndicate]], [[Odd Oberheim]], [[Jacky jasper]] (who appears as Jacky Jasper on the song &quot;We Sleep Days&quot; and H-Bomb on &quot;War&quot;), D.J. Cisco from S.M., the [[Synth-a-Size Sisters]] and Teflon. 

While the group only recorded one album together as the Analog Brothers, a few bootlegs of its live concert performances, including freestyles with original lyrics, have occasionally surfaced online. After ''Pimp to Eat'', the Analog Brothers continued performing together in various line ups. [[Kool Keith]] and Marc Live joined with [[Jacky jasper]] to release two albums as KHM. Marc Live rapped with Ice T's group SMG. Marc also formed a group with Black Silver called Live Black, but while five of their tracks were released on a demo CD sold at concerts, Live Black's first album has yet to be released.

In 2008, [[Ice-T]] and Black Silver toured together as Black Ice, and released an album together called Urban Legends.

In addition to all this, the Analog Brothers continue to make frequent appearances on each other's solo albums.

The '''motor neurone diseases''' (or '''motor neuron diseases''') (MND) are a group of [[neurological disorder]]s that selectively affect [[motor neuron]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000031126|motor neuron disease}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cells that control voluntary muscle activity including speaking, walking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body.

==Terminology==
''MND'' refers to a group of diseases that affect motor neurones. In the [[United States]], MND is more commonly called ''[[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]]'', or ''[[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease'', after the [[baseball]] player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm |title=Motor Neuron Diseases Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |publisher=www.ninds.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In France the disease is sometimes known as ''maladie de Charcot'' (Charcot's disease), although it may also be referred to by the direct translation of ALS, ''sclerose laterale amyotrophique (SLA)''. To avoid confusion, the annual scientific research conference dedicated to the study of MND is called the International ALS/MND Symposium. ALS/MND refers to a specific subset of pathologically identical diseases; there are numerous other afflictions of motor neurones that are pathologically distinct from ALS/MND and have a different clinical course. Examples of other diseases of the motor neurone that should not be confused with ALS/MND include [[spinobulbar muscular atrophy]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]], [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]], and many others.

==History==
Although other 19th century neurologists previously described the disease, a [[France|French]] [[neurology|neurologist]], [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], first suggested grouping together disparate conditions that affect the [[lateral horn]] of the spinal cord in 1869.

==Classification==
Forms of motor neurone disease include:
* [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) (sometimes called [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease)
* [[primary lateral sclerosis]] (PLS)
* [[progressive muscular atrophy]] (PMA)
* bulbar&lt;ref&gt;{{GPnotebook|-1127219181|Types of MND}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[pseudobulbar palsy]] - spastic
** [[progressive bulbar palsy]] - spastic and flaccid

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

 | [[Progressive muscular atrophy|PMA]] || no || yes 
 |- 
 | [[Progressive bulbar palsy]] || no || yes - bulbar region
 |- 
 | [[Pseudobulbar palsy]] || yes - bulbar region  || no
|}

The &quot;bulbar region&quot; in the table above refers to the mouth, face, and throat.

[[Spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA) is classified under MND by [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]], but not by [[ICD-10]].

==Causes==
About 90% of cases of MND are &quot;sporadic&quot;, meaning that the patient has no family history of ALS and the case appears to have occurred with no known cause. Genetic factors are suspected to be important in determining an individual's susceptibility to disease, and there is some weak evidence to suggest that onset can be &quot;triggered&quot; by as yet unknown environmental factors (see 'Epidemiology' below). 
 
Approximately 10% of cases are &quot;familial MND&quot;, defined either by a family history of MND or by testing positive for a known genetic mutation associated with the disease. The following genes are known to be linked to ALS: Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase {{Gene|SOD1}}, {{Gene|ALS2}}, {{Gene|NEFH}} (a small number of cases), senataxin ({{Gene|SETX}}) and vesicle associated protein B ({{Gene|VAPB}}).

Of these, SOD1 mutations account for some 20% of familial MND cases. The ''SOD1'' gene codes for the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] scavenger that reduces the [[oxidative stress]] of cells throughout the body. So far over 100 different mutations in the SOD1 gene have been found, all of which cause some form of ALS([http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk ALSOD database]). In North America, the most commonly occurring mutation is known as [[A4V]] and occurs in up to 50% of SOD1 cases. In people of [[Scandinavia]]n extraction there is a relatively benign mutation called D90A which is associated with a slow progression. In Japan, the H46R mutation is most common. [[G93A]], the mutation used to generate the first animal model (and by far the most widely studied), is present only in a few families worldwide. Future research is concentrating on identifying new genetic mutations and the clinical syndrome associated with them. Familial MND may also confer a higher risk of developing cognitive changes such as frontotemporal dementia or executive dysfunction (see 'extra-motor change in MND' below).

It is thought that ''SOD1'' mutations confer a toxic gain, rather than a loss, of function to the enzyme. SOD1 mutations may increase the propensity for the enzyme to form protein aggregates which are toxic to nerve cells.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Skeletal muscle]]s are innervated by a group of neurones (''[[lower motor neurones]]'') located in the ventral horns of the spinal cord which project out the [[ventral roots]] to the muscle cells. These nerve cells are themselves innervated by the [[corticospinal tract]] or ''[[upper motor neurones]]'' that project from the [[motor cortex]] of the brain. On macroscopic pathology, there is a degeneration of the ventral horns of the spinal cord, as well as atrophy of the ventral roots. In the brain, atrophy may be present in the frontal and temporal lobes. On microscopic examination, neurones may show [[spongiosis]], the presence of [[astrocytes]], and a number of inclusions including characteristic [[skein-like inclusion|&quot;skein-like&quot; inclusions]], [[Bunina body|Bunina bodies]], and [[vacuole|vacuolisation]]. Bunina bodies were first described in 1962; they are markers of neuronal degeneration.

The availability of mouse models has led to extensive research into the causes of [[SOD1]]-mutant linked familial [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. The most commonly used mouse model is G93A,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Motor neuron degeneration in mice that express a human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase mutation |journal=Science |year= 1994 |volume= 264 |issue=5166|pages=1772–5|pmid=8209258|last1=Gurney|first1=ME|last2=Pu|first2=H|last3=Chiu|first3=AY|last4=Dal Canto|first4=MC|last5=Polchow|first5=CY|last6=Alexander|first6=DD|last7=Caliendo|first7=J|last8=Hentati|first8=A|last9=Kwon|first9=YW|doi=10.1126/science.8209258}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many others have since been generated. At the gross physiological level, the mouse models faithfully recapitulate the features of human ALS (motorneuron death, muscle atrophy, respiratory failure).

Although there is no consensus as to the exact mechanism by which mutated SOD1 causes the disease (in either mice or patients), studies based largely on mouse models suggest a role for [[excitotoxicity]] and more controversially, [[oxidative stress]], presumably secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction. Death by [[apoptosis]] has also been suggested.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms usually present themselves between the ages of 50-70, and include progressive weakness, muscle wasting, and muscle [[fasciculation]]s, spasticity or stiffness in the arms and legs, and overactive tendon reflexes. Patients may present with symptoms as diverse as a dragging foot, unilateral muscle wasting in the hands, or slurred speech. 

Neurological examination presents specific signs associated with upper and lower motor neurone degeneration. Signs of [[upper motor neuron]]e damage include [[spasticity]], brisk [[reflex]]es and the [[Plantar reflex|Babinski sign]]. Signs of [[lower motor neuron]]e damage include weakness and muscle atrophy. 

Note that every muscle group in the body requires both upper and lower motor neurones to function. The signs described above can occur in any muscle group, including the arms, legs, torso, and bulbar region. 

The symptoms described above may resemble a number of other rare diseases, known as &quot;MND Mimic Disorders&quot;. These include, but are not limited to, multifocal motor [[neuropathy]], [[Kennedy disease|Kennedy's disease]], [[hereditary spastic paraplegia]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]] and [[monomelic amyotrophy]]. A small subset of familial MND cases occur in children, such as &quot;juvenile ALS&quot;, Madras syndrome, and individuals who have inherited the ALS2 gene. However, these are not typically referred to as MND, but by their specific names.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of MND is a clinical one, established by a neurologist on the basis of history and neurological examination. There is no diagnostic test for MND. Investigations such as blood tests, [[electromyography]] (EMG), [[magnetic resonance imaging]]  (MRI), and sometimes [[genetic testing]] are useful to rule out other disorders that may mimic MND. However, the diagnosis of MND remains a clinical one. Having excluded other diseases, a relatively rapid progression of symptoms is a strong diagnostic factor. Although an individual's progression may sometimes &quot;plateau&quot;, it will not improve. 

A set of diagnostic criteria called the El Escorial criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brooks BR |title=El Escorial World Federation of Neurology criteria for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Subcommittee on Motor Neuron Diseases/Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis of the World Federation of Neurology Research Group on Neuromuscular Diseases and the El Escorial &quot;Clinical limits of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot; workshop contributors |journal=J. Neurol. Sci. |volume=124 Suppl |issue= |pages=96–107 |year=1994 |pmid=7807156 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfnals.org/guidelines/1998elescorial/elescorial1998criteria.htm |title=El Escorial Revisited: Revised Criteria for the Diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Requirements for Diagnosis |accessdate=2007-06-06 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070517041851/http://www.wfnals.org/guidelines/1998elescorial/elescorial1998criteria.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been defined by the World Federation of Neurologists for use in research, particularly as inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials. Owing to a lack of clinical diagnostic criteria, some neurologists use the El Escorial criteria during the diagnostic process, although strictly speaking this is [[Scope creep|functionality creep]], and some have questioned the appropriateness of the criteria in a clinical setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Belsh JM |title=ALS diagnostic criteria of El Escorial Revisited: do they meet the needs of clinicians as well as researchers? |journal=Amyotroph. Lateral Scler. Other Motor Neuron Disord. |volume=1 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S57–60 |year=2000 |pmid=11464928 |doi=10.1080/14660820052415925}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is possible that [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] can be used to diagnose MND.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Twitch of Potential | url = http://www.time.com/time/pacific/magazine/article/0,13673,503060501-1186615,00.html | work = Time | accessdate = 2006-12-30 | date=2006-04-24 | first=Daniel | last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently there is no cure for ALS.  The only drug that affects the course of the disease is [[riluzole]]. The drug functions by blocking the effects of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and is thought to extend the lifespan of an ALS patient by only a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1002/14651858.CD001447.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of effective medications to slow the progression of ALS does not mean that patients with ALS cannot be medically cared for. Instead, treatment of patients with ALS focuses on the relief of symptoms associated with the disease. This involves a variety of health professionals including neurologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, [[occupational therapist]]s, dieticians, respiratory therapists, social workers, palliative care specialists, specialist nurses and psychologists.

==Prognosis==
Most cases of MND progress quite quickly, with noticeable decline occurring over the course of months. Although symptoms may present in one region, they will typically spread. If restricted to one side of the body they are more likely to progress to the same region on the other side of the body before progressing to a new region. After several years, most patients require help to carry out activities of daily living such as self care, feeding, and transportation. 

MND is typically fatal within 2–5 years. Around 50% die within 14 months of diagnosis. The remaining 50% will not necessarily die within the next 14 months as the distribution is significantly skewed. As a rough estimate, 1 in 5 patients survive for 5 years, and 1 in 10 patients survive 10 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Professor [[Stephen Hawking]] is a well-known example of a person with MND, and has lived for nearly 50 years with the disease. The television film [[Hawking (TV film)|''Hawking'']] starring [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] was made in 2004 about him and this disease.

Mortality normally results when control of the diaphragm is impaired and the ability to breathe is lost. One exception is [[Primary Lateral Sclerosis]] (PLS), which may last for upwards of 25 years. Given the typical age of onset, this effectively leaves most PLS patients with a normal life span. PLS can progress to ALS, decades later.

==Complications==
===Emotional lability===
{{Main|labile affect}}

Around a third of all MND patients experience [[labile affect]], also known as emotional lability, pseudobulbar affect, or pathological laughter and crying. Patients with pseudobulbar palsy are particularly likely to be affected, as are patients with PLS.

===Effects on cognition, mood, and senses===
[[Cognition|Cognitive]] change occurs in between 33&amp;ndash;50% of patients. A small proportion exhibit a form of [[frontotemporal dementia]] characterised by behavioural abnormalities such as [[disinhibition]], [[apathy]], and personality changes. A small proportion of patients may also suffer from an [[aphasia]], which causes difficulty in naming specific objects. A larger proportion (up to 50%) suffer from a milder version of cognitive change which primarily affects what is known as [[executive functions|executive function]]. Briefly, this is the ability of an individual to initiate, inhibit, sustain, and switch attention and is involved in the organisation of complex tasks down to smaller components. Often patients with such changes find themselves unable to do the family finances or drive a car. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is surprisingly rare in MND (around 5&amp;ndash;20%) relative to the frequency with which it is found in other, less severe, neurological disorders e.g. ~50% in [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], ~20% in Epilepsy.  Depression does not necessarily increase as the symptoms progress, and in fact many patients report being happy with their [[quality of life]] despite profound disability.  This may reflect the use of [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] such as reevaluating what is important in life.

Although traditionally thought only to affect the motor system, sensory abnormalities are not necessarily absent, with some patients finding altered sensation to touch and heat, found in around 10% of patients. Patients with a predominantly upper motor neurone syndrome, and particularly PLS, often report an enhanced startle reflex to loud noises.

Neuroimaging and neuropathology has demonstrated extra-motor changes in the frontal lobes including the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[superior frontal gyrus]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and [[superior temporal gyrus]]. The degree of pathology in these areas has been directly related to the degree of cognitive change experienced by the patient, if any. Patients with MND and dementia have been shown to exhibit marked [[frontotemporal lobe]] atrophy as revealed by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] [[neuroimaging]].

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of MND is approximately 1&amp;ndash;5 out of 100,000 people. Men have a slightly higher incidence rate than women. Approximately 5,600 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. every year. By far the greatest risk factor is age, with symptoms typically presenting between the ages of 50-70. Cases under the age of 50 years are called &quot;young onset MND&quot;, whilst incidence rates appear to tail off after the age of 85. 

There are three &quot;hot spots&quot; of MND in the world. One is in the Kii peninsula of Japan, one amongst a tribal population in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Chamorro inhabitants from the island of [[Guam]] in the [[Oceania|Pacific Ocean]] have an increased risk of developing a form of MND known as Guamanian ALS-PD-dementia complex or &quot;lytico bodig&quot;, although the incidence rate has declined over the last 50 years and the average age of onset has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waring, S.C et al. |title=Incidence of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and of the Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex of Guam, 1950-1989 |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=192–199 |year=2004 |doi=10.1159/000078505 |pmid=15272222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putative theories involve neurotoxins in the traditional diet including [[cycad]] nut flour and bats that have eaten cycad nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2003/12/09/flying_fox_linked_to_disease/ |title=Flying fox linked to disease - The Boston Globe |accessdate=2007-06-06 |format= |work= | date=2003-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller G |title=Neurodegenerative disease.

==Etymology==
Terminology around the motor neurone diseases can be confusing; in the UK &quot;motor neurone disease&quot; refers to both ALS specifically (the most common form of disease) and to the broader spectrum of motor neurone diseases including [[progressive muscular atrophy]], [[primary lateral sclerosis]], and [[progressive bulbar palsy]]. In the United States the most common terms used are ALS (both specifically for ALS and as a [[blanket term]]) or &quot;Lou Gehrig's disease&quot;.

''Amyotrophic'' comes from the [[Greek language]]: ''A-'' means &quot;no&quot;, ''myo'' refers to &quot;muscle&quot;, and ''trophic'' means &quot;nourishment&quot;; ''amyotrophic'' therefore means &quot;no muscle nourishment,&quot; which describes the characteristic [[atrophy|atrophication]] of the sufferer's disused muscle tissue. ''Lateral'' identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that are affected are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening (&quot;[[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]]&quot;) in the region.

An '''abjad''' is a type of [[writing system]] in which each symbol always or usually&lt;ref name=&quot;omniglot&quot;&gt;[http://omniglot.com/writing/alphabetic.htm Omniglot: ''Abjads / Consonant alphabets'']: &quot;Abjads, or consonant alphabets, represent consonants only, or consonants plus some vowels. Full vowel indication (vocalisation) can be added, usually by means of diacritics, but this is not usually done.&quot; Accessed 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; stands for a [[consonant]]; the reader must supply the appropriate [[vowel]].
It is a term suggested by [[Peter T. Daniels]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., et al. eds. ''The World's Writing Systems'' Oxford. (1996), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the common terms  '''consonantary''' or '''consonantal [[alphabet]]''' or '''[[syllabary]]''' to refer to the family of scripts called [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]]. In popular usage, abjads often contain the word &quot;alphabet&quot; in their names, such as &quot;[[Arabic alphabet]]&quot; and &quot;[[Phoenician alphabet]]&quot;. The name ''abjad'' itself derives from the Arabic word for [[alphabet]]. The word &quot;Alphabet&quot; in English has a source in Phonecian language the first two letters of which were  A (Aleph) and B (Beth), hence Alephbeth. In Arabic, A (Alif),B (Ba), J (Jeem), D (Daal) make the word &quot;Abjad&quot; which means &quot;Alphabet&quot;. It is also used to enumerate a list like a,b,c,d etc are used in English language. 

== Terminology ==
According to the formulations of Daniels, abjads differ from [[alphabet]]s in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic [[grapheme]]s. Abjads differ from [[abugida]]s, another category invented by Daniels, in that in abjads the vowel sound is ''implied'' by [[phonology]], and where [[Diacritic|vowel marks]] exist for the system, such as [[niqqud|nikkud]] for [[Hebrew]] and [[harakat|harakāt]] for [[Arabic]], their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas always mark the vowels (other than the &quot;inherent&quot; vowel) with a diacritic, a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone [[glyph]]. Some abugidas use a special symbol to ''suppress'' the [[inherent vowel]] so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a [[syllabary]], a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.

==Origins==
[[Image:Ba`alat.png|thumb|275px|A specimen of Proto-Sinaitic script containing a phrase which may mean 'death to Baalat'. The line running from the upper left to lower right reads ''mt l b&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;lt''.]]

{{See also|Genealogy of scripts derived from Proto-Sinaitic|History of the alphabet#Descendants of the Semitic abjad}}
All known abjads belong to the [[Semitic alphabets|Semitic family of scripts]]. These scripts are thought to derive from the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets#Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic alphabet]] (dated to about 1500 BC) which is thought to derive from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. The abjad was significantly simpler than the earlier hieroglyphs. The number of distinct glyphs was reduced tremendously, at the cost of increased ambiguity.

The first abjad to gain widespread usage was the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician abjad]]. Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] and Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Phoenician script consisted of only about two dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and Phoenician seafaring merchants took the script wherever they went. Phoenician gave way to a number of new writing systems, including the [[Greek alphabet]], and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], a widely used abjad. Greek evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.

Aramaic spread across Asia, reaching as far as India and becoming [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]], the ancestral abugida to most modern Indian and Southeast Asian scripts. In the Middle East, Aramaic gave rise to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] abjads, which retained many of the Aramaic letter forms. The [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]] was a cursive variation of Aramaic. It is unclear whether the Arabic abjad was derived from Nabatean or Syriac.

==Impure abjads==
[[Image:Arabic albayancalligraphy.svg|thumb|250px| &quot;Al-'Arabiyya&quot;, lit. &quot;the Arabic&quot; An example of the Arabic script, which is an impure abjad.]]
&quot;Impure&quot; abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term &quot;pure&quot; abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators. However, most modern abjads, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] and [[Avestan alphabet|Avestan]], are '''&quot;impure&quot; abjads''', that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes. An example of a pure abjad is ancient [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]].

===Addition of vowels===
{{Main|Greek alphabet}}

In the 9th century BC, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when the vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the [[guttural consonant|guttural]] sounds represented by [[aleph]], [[he (letter)|he]], [[Heth (letter)|heth]] or [[ayin]], so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[Yodh|yod]] were also used. The Greek alphabet thus became the world's first &quot;true&quot; alphabet.

[[Abugida]]s developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent &quot;a&quot;  vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the [[South Arabian alphabet]] evolved into the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, around the 3rd century BC, the [[Brāhmī script]] developed (from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic abjad]], it has been hypothesised).

==Abjads and the structure of Semitic languages==
The abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write.  This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from [[triliteral|a root consisting of (usually) three consonants]], the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms.  For instance, from the Arabic root {{lang|ar|ذبح}} ''{{unicode|Ḏ-B-Ḥ}}'' (to sacrifice) can be derived the forms {{lang|ar|ذَبَح}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḏabaḥa}}'' (he sacrificed), {{lang|ar|ذَبَحْتَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḏabaḥta}}'' (you (masculine singular) sacrificed), {{lang|ar|ذَبَّحَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḏabbaḥa}}'' (he slaughtered), {{lang|ar|يُذَبِّح}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yuḏabbiḥ}}'' (he slaughters), and {{lang|ar|مَذْبَح}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏbaḥ}}'' (slaughterhouse). In each case, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, meaning that readers with knowledge of one word of the same root would have an easier time picking up on the similarity of meaning.

==Application to non-Semitic languages==
Many non-Semitic languages such as English could, theoretically, be written without vowels. It would be more difficult to read, but many words could be interpreted in context. This fact can be used to semi-[[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerise]] offensive language, a practice known as [[disemvoweling]]. Many European languages, however, would lose grammatical information such as gender, case, and/or number. However, in English text the few inflections contain distinct consonants. It can be written without vowels and might still be clear, as in the first sentence of this paragraph: &quot;Mny nn-Smtc lnggs sch s Nglsh, cld, thrtclly, b wrttn wtht vwls.&quot; This is a poor example, but it can be understood with effort.

In general, non-Semitic texts are often puzzling and ambiguous without their vowels, more so if the context and subject are unknown, because the consonant sequences for many word roots are not unique. For example, in English, &quot;abate&quot;, &quot;abet&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;abut&quot;,
&quot;bat&quot;, &quot;bait&quot;, &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;beat&quot;, &quot;beet&quot;, &quot;bit&quot;, &quot;bite&quot;, &quot;bot&quot;, &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;boot&quot;, &quot;bout&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, and &quot;byte&quot; all reduce to &quot;bt&quot;. Nevertheless, [[Indo-European languages]] can be written adequately using the ''impure'' abjads of Arabic and Hebrew, as with [[Persian_language#Orthography|Persian orthography]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

An '''abugida''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ɑː|b|uː|ˈ|ɡ|iː|d|ə}}; from [[Ge'ez language|Ge‘ez]] አቡጊዳ ''’äbugida''), also called an '''alphasyllabary''', is a [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] [[writing system]] which is based on [[consonant]]s, and in which [[vowel]] notation is obligatory but secondary. This contrasts with an [[alphabet]] proper, in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an [[abjad]], in which vowel marking is absent or optional. (In less formal treatments, all three are commonly called alphabets.) Abugidas include the extensive [[Brahmic family of scripts]] used in South and Southeast Asia.

The term ''abugida'' was suggested by [[Peter T. Daniels]] in his 1990 [[Linguistic typology|typology]] of [[writing system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/602899 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an Ethiopian name of the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge‘ez script]], ''’ä bu gi da,'' taken from four letters of that script the way ''[[abecedary]]'' derives from Latin ''a be ce de.'' As Daniels used the word, an abugida contrasts with a [[syllabary]], where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to each another, and with an [[alphabet]] proper, where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels. The term ''alphasyllabary'' was suggested for the Indic scripts in 1997 by [[William Bright]], following South Asian linguistic usage, to convey the idea that &quot;they share features of both alphabet and syllabary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;He describes this term as &quot;formal&quot;, i.e. more concerned with graphic arrangement of symbols, whereas ''abugida'' was &quot;functional&quot;, putting the focus on sound–symbol correspondence, but this is not a distinction made in the literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;William Bright (2000:65–66): ''A Matter of Tpology: Alphasyllabaries and Abugidas''. In: Studies in the Linguistic Sciences. Volume 30, Number 1, pages 63–71&lt;/ref&gt; Abugidas were long considered to be syllabaries or intermediate between syllabaries and alphabets, and the term &quot;syllabics&quot; is retained in the name of [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]. Other terms that have been used include ''neosyllabary'' ([[James-Germain Février|Février]] 1959), ''pseudo-alphabet'' ([[Fred Householder|Householder]] 1959), [[semi-syllabary|''semisyllabary'']] ([[David Diringer|Diringer]] 1968; a word which has other uses) and ''syllabic alphabet'' ([[Florian Coulmas|Coulmas]] 1996; this term is also a synonym for [[syllabary]]).&lt;ref name=Bright/&gt;

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

==Description==
In general, a letter of an abugida transcribes a consonant. Letters are written as a linear sequence, in most cases left to right. Vowels are written through modification of these consonant letters, either by means of [[diacritic]]s (which may not follow the direction of writing the letters) or by changes in the form of the letter itself.

Vowels not preceded by a consonant may be represented with a [[zero consonant]] letter, modified to indicate the vowel, or separate letters for each vowel, that are distinct from the corresponding dependent vowel signs. Consonants not followed by a vowel may be represented with:
*a modification which explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel ([[virama]]),
*a lack of vowel marking (often with ambiguity between no vowel and a default [[inherent vowel]]),
*vowel marking for a short or neutral vowel such as [[schwa]] (with ambiguity between no vowel and that short or neutral vowel),
*[[Typographic ligature|conjunct consonant]] letters where two or more letters are graphically joined in a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]], or
*dependent consonant signs, which may be smaller or differently placed versions of the full consonant letters, or may be distinct signs altogether.

There are three principal families of abugidas, depending on whether vowels are indicated by modifying consonants by ''diacritics, distortion,'' or ''orientation.''&lt;ref&gt;John D. Berry (2002:19) ''Language Culture Type''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The oldest and largest is the [[Brahmic family]] of India and Southeast Asia, in which vowels are marked with [[diacritic]]s and syllable-final consonants, when they occur, are indicated with [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], diacritics, or with a special [[virama|vowel-canceling mark]].
*In the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic family]], vowels are marked by modifying the shapes of the consonants, and one of these pulls double duty for final consonants.
*In the [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree family]], vowels are marked by rotating or flipping the consonants, and final consonants are indicated with either special diacritics or superscript forms of the main initial consonants.

[[Tāna]] of the [[Maldives]] has dependent vowels and a zero vowel sign, but no inherent vowel.

===Indic (Brahmic)===
{{see also|Brahmic family of scripts}}

Indic scripts originated in [[India]] and spread to [[Southeast Asia]]. All surviving Indic scripts are descendants of the [[Brahmi alphabet]]. Today they are used in most languages of [[South Asia]] (although replaced by [[Perso-Arabic]] in [[Urdu]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and some other languages of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]) and mainland [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]]; but not [[Malaysia]] or [[Vietnam]]).  The primary division is into North Indic scripts used in Northern India, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and Southern Indic scripts used in [[South India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Southeast Asia]].
South Indic letter forms are very rounded; North Indic less so, though [[Oriya script|Oriya]], [[Golmol]] and Litumol of Nepal script are rounded.

Most North Indic scripts' full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top, with [[Gujarati script]] an exception; South Indic scripts do not.

Indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) around the consonants, often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel. If a consonant has no vowel sign, this indicates a default vowel. Vowel diacritics may appear above, below, to the left, to the right, or around the consonant. 

The most populous Indic script is [[Devanagari]], used for [[Hindi]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and often [[Sanskrit]]. A basic letter such as क represents a syllable with the default vowel, in this case ''ka'' ({{IPA|[kə]}}), or, in final position, a final consonant, in this case ''k.'' This inherent vowel may be changed by adding vowel marks ([[diacritic]]s), producing syllables such as कि ''ki,'' कु ''ku,'' के ''ke,''  को ''ko.'' The [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] a consonant letter represents, either with or without a marked vowel, is called an [[akshara]].

In many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like {{Unicode|ि}} ''-i,'' falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced. For example, the game [[cricket]] in [[Hindi]] is क्रिकेट ''krikeţ;'' the diacritic for {{IPA|/i/}} appears before the [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/kr/}}, not before the {{IPA|/r/}}. A more unusual example is seen in the [[Batak alphabet]]: Here the syllable ''bim'' is written ''ba-ma-i-(virama)''. That is, the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable.

In many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding the bare consonant. In [[Devanagari]], क् is ''k,'' and ल् is ''l''.  This is called the ''[[virama]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], or ''halant'' in [[Hindi]]. It may be used to form [[consonant cluster]]s, or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word. For writing two consonants without a vowel in between, instead of using diacritics on the first consonant to remove its vowel, another popular method of special [[conjunct]] forms is used in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster, such as Devanagari: क्ल ''kla.'' (Note that on some fonts display this as क् followed by ल, rather than forming a conjunct. This expedient is used by [[ISCII]] and South Asian scripts of [[Unicode]].) Thus a closed syllable such as ''kal'' requires two [[akshara]] to write.

The [[Róng]] script used for the [[Lepcha language]] goes further than other Indic abugidas, in that a single akshara can represent a closed syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable [sok] would be written as something like {{unicode|s̥̽}}, here with an underring representing {{IPA|/o/}} and an overcross representing the diacritic for final {{IPA|/k/}}. Most other Indic abugidas can only indicate a very limited set of final consonants with diacritics, such as {{IPA|/ŋ/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, if they can indicate any at all.

===Ethiopic===
[[Image:Ethiopic genesis.jpg|thumb|The [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez script]], an abugida of Eritrea and Ethiopia]]
In [[Ethiopic]], from which the term ''abugida'' originates, the diacritics have fused to the consonants to the point that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters. Children learn each modification separately, as in a syllabary; nonetheless, the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant is readily apparent, unlike the case in a true syllabary.

Though now an abugida, the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] was actually an [[abjad]] until the advent of Christianity ''ca'' 350 CE. In the Ge'ez  abugida, the form of the letter itself may be altered. For example, ሀ ''hä'' {{IPA|[hə]}} (base form), ሁ ''hu'' (with a right-side diacritic that does not alter the letter), ሂ ''hi'' (with a subdiacritic that compresses the letter, so that the whole fidel occupies the same amount of space), ህ ''hə'' {{IPA|[hɨ]}} or {{IPA|[h]}} (where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm).

===Canadian Aboriginal syllabics===
&lt;!--[[Image:Lci.gif]] an inscription of [[Old Kawi]] found in the [[Philippines]]--&gt;

In the family known as [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], vowels are indicated by changing the orientation of the [[akshara]]. Each vowel has a consistent orientation; for example, [[Inuktitut]] ᐱ ''pi,'' ᐳ ''pu,'' ᐸ ''pa;'' ᑎ ''ti,'' ᑐ ''tu,'' ᑕ ''ta''. Although there is a vowel inherent in each, all rotations have equal status and none can be identified as basic. Bare consonants are indicated either by separate diacritics, or by superscript versions of the aksharas; there is no vowel-killer mark.

==Borderline cases==
===Voweled abjads===
Consonantal scripts (&quot;[[abjad]]s&quot;) are normally written without indication of many vowels. However in some contexts like teaching materials or [[scripture]]s, [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]] are written with full indication of vowels via diacritic marks ([[harakat]], [[niqqud]]) making them effectively abugidas. The Brahmic and Ethiopic families are thought to have originated from the Semitic abjads by the addition of vowel marks.

&lt;!-- Not best place to mention Thaana since not an abjad
[[Thaana]] is similar, with all vowels marked with diacritics, and no inherent vowel. However, the absence of a vowel is also marked with a diacritic, as in many Indic abugidas. Thaana developed among a population that was already literate in an Indic abugida.
--&gt;
The Arabic-alphabet scripts used for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in Iraq and for [[Uighur language|Uighur]] in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]] are fully voweled, but since the vowels are full letters rather than diacritics, and there are no inherent vowels, these are considered alphabets rather than abugidas.

===Phagspa===
The imperial Mongol script called [['Phags-pa script|Phagspa]] was derived from the Tibetan abugida, but all vowels are written in-line rather than as diacritics. However, it retains the features of having an inherent vowel /a/ and having distinct initial vowel letters.

===Pahawh===
[[Pahawh Hmong]] is a non-segmental script that indicates [[syllable onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rime]]s, such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants. Thus it is not segmental and cannot be considered an abugida. However, it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Most syllables are written with two letters in the order rime–onset (typically vowel-consonant), even though they are pronounced as onset-rime (consonant-vowel), rather like the position of the {{IPA|/i/}} vowel in Devanagari, which is written before the consonant. Pahawh is also unusual in that, while an inherent rime {{IPA|/āu/}} (with mid tone) is unwritten, it also has an inherent onset {{IPA|/k/}}. For the syllable {{IPA|/kau/}}, which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is {{IPA|/au/}} that is written. Thus it is the rime (vowel) which is basic to the system.

===Meroitic===
It is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] scripts. For example, the [[Meroitic script]] of ancient [[Sudan]] did not indicate an inherent ''a'' (one symbol stood for both ''m'' and ''ma,'' for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel.

===Shorthand===
Several systems of [[shorthand]] use diacritics for vowels, but they do not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to [[Thaana]] and [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish script]] than to the Brahmic scripts. The [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] system and its derivatives modify the ''following'' consonant to represent vowels. The [[Pollard script]], which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].  [[Pitman shorthand]] uses straight strokes and quarter-circle marks in different orientations as the principal &quot;alphabet&quot; of consonants; vowels are shown as light and heavy dots, dashes and other marks in one of 3 possible positions to indicate the various vowel-sounds.  However, to increase writing-speed Pitman has rules for [http://pitmanshorthand.homestead.com &quot;vowel indication&quot;] using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel-marks can be dispensed with.

==Development==
As the term ''alphasyllabary'' suggests, abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]]. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from [[abjad]]s (vowelless alphabets).  They contrast with syllabaries, where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other, and typically develop directly from [[logogram|logographic scripts]]. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese [[hiragana]] syllabary: か ''ka'', き ''ki'', く ''ku'', け ''ke'', こ ''ko'' have nothing in common to indicate ''k;'' while ら ''ra'', り ''ri'', る ''ru'', れ ''re'', ろ ''ro'' have neither anything in common for ''r'', nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the ''k'' set.

Most Indian and Indochinese abugidas appear to have first been developed from abjads with the {{Unicode|[[Kharoṣṭhī]]}} and [[Brāhmī script]]s; the abjad in question is usually considered to be the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] one, but while the link between Aramaic and Kharosthi is more or less undisputed, this is not the case with Brahmi. The Kharosthi family does not survive today, but Brahmi's descendants include most of the modern scripts of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Ge'ez derived from a different abjad, the [[Sabean script]] of [[Yemen]]; the advent of vowels coincided with the introduction of Christianity about 350&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Getatchew Haile, &quot;Ethiopic Writing&quot;.

'''ABBA''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pop music]] group formed in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 which consisted of [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid &quot;Frida&quot; Lyngstad]], [[Björn Ulvaeus]], [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Agnetha Fältskog]]. They became one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|most commercially successful acts]] in the history of pop music, topping the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982.
ABBA sold over 375 million records worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23673187/|title=Former ABBA drummer found dead in garden|author=Amol Rajan|publisher=[[msnbc]]|accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2140612,00.html | location=London | work=The Times | title=Its Abba on the phone making a lot more money money money | first=Adam | last=Sherwin | date=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made them the fourth best-selling popular music artists in the history of recorded music.

Apart from reaching the top of the charts in different countries like Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru among others, ABBA also released a [[Gracias Por La Música (album)|compilation]] of their hit songs in Spanish.

During the band's existence, Fältskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and Andersson–although both couples later divorced. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which led ultimately to the collapse of the Ulvaeus-Fältskog marriage (in 1979) and the Andersson-Lyngstad marriage (in 1981). In the late 1970s and early 1980s these relationship changes began appearing in the group's music, as they produced more introspective lyrics with different compositions.

After ABBA broke up early 1983, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued individual solo careers with varying success. ABBA's music remained steadily popular until several films, notably ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'', revived interest in the group, spawning several [[tribute band]]s. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' that toured worldwide. [[Mamma Mia! (film)|A film of the same name]] released in 2008 became the highest grossing film in the UK that year. The group was inducted into [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on 15 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-quick16-2009dec16,0,6237547.story |title=ABBA makes Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Los Angeles Times 16&amp;nbsp;December 2009 |publisher=Latimes.com |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Before ABBA (1960s)===
[[Benny Andersson]] (born 16 December 1946 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden) became (at age 18) the member of a popular Swedish pop-rock group, [[The Hep Stars]], that performed covers of international hits. The Hep Stars were known as &quot;The Swedish Beatles&quot;. They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of the [[Apple Corps]]. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original compositions for his band, many of which became major hits including &quot;No Response&quot; that hit #3 in 1965, &quot;Sunny Girl&quot;, &quot;Wedding&quot; &amp; &quot;Consolation&quot;, all of which hit #1 in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he composed his first [[Svensktoppen]] entry &quot;''Sagan om lilla Sofi''&quot; (&quot;The Story of Little Sophie&quot;) in 1968.

[[Björn Ulvaeus]] (born 25 April 1945 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden) also began his musical career at 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted [[The Hootenanny Singers]], a popular Swedish [[folk music|folk]]-[[skiffle]] group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and The Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was &quot;Isn't It Easy to Say&quot;, a song later recorded by The Hep Stars. [[Stig Anderson]] was the manager of The Hootenanny Singers and founder of the [[Polar Music]] label. He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to compose more. Both also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although not until 1969 did the pair write and produce some of their first real hits together: &quot;''Ljuva sextital''&quot; ('Merry Sixties'), recorded by Brita Borg and The Hep Stars' 1969 hit &quot;''Speleman''&quot; (&quot;Fiddler&quot;).

Andersson wrote and submitted the song &quot;Hej, Clown&quot; for the 1969 [[Melodifestivalen]], the Swedish [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called ''[[Lycka]]'' (&quot;Happiness&quot;), which included original compositions sung by both men. Their spouses were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; Fältskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with The Hootenanny Singers until the summer of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.

[[Agnetha Fältskog]] (born 5 April 1950 in [[Jönköping]], Sweden) had a #1 record in Sweden when she was 17, and was soon noted by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of ''[[schlager]]'' style songs. Fältskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers like [[Connie Francis]]. Along with her own compositions, she recorded [[cover version|covers]] of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish [[folkpark]]s. In 1967 she submitted an original song (''Försonade'' (&quot;Redeemed&quot;)) for [[Melodifestivalen]], but it was rejected. She briefly met Anni-Frid Lyngstad for the first time during a TV show in January 1968, and met Björn Ulvaeus at a concert venue a few months later.

During filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, Fältskog met Ulvaeus again, and they got married in 1971. Fältskog and Ulvaeus eventually got involved in each other's recording sessions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to her 1970 album ''Som jag är'' (''As I Am''). In 1973, Fältskog starred as [[Mary Magdalene]] in the original Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, Fältskog released five studio albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=112–129 and 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid &quot;Frida&quot; Lyngstad]] (born 15 November 1945 in Bjørkåsen in Ballangen, Norway) sang from the age of thirteen with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the summer of 1967, she won a national talent competition with the song &quot;''En ledig dag''&quot; (&quot;A Day Off&quot;), included in the EMI compilation ''[[Frida 1967-1972]]''. The first prize was a recording contract with [[EMI]] Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV show in Sweden. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3½ hour documentary ''[[Frida - The DVD]]''. Lyngstad released several singles on EMI and had many hits in the Swedish charts. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she got her first #1 single, &quot;''Min egen stad''&quot; (&quot;My Own Town&quot;), for which all the future ABBA members sang the backup vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Björn Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and Agnetha Fältskog during a TV show in early 1968.

Lyngstad finally linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestivalen, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in September 1969– her first collaboration with Benny &amp; Björn, as they had written the song. Later Andersson produced Lyngstad's debut album, ''[[Frida (album)|Frida]]'', which was released in March 1971 and praised by critics. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, ''[[Frida Ensam]]'', which included the original Swedish rendition of &quot;[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]&quot;, a hit in Scandinavia before the English version was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=41–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First live performance and the start of &quot;Festfolk&quot;====
An attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of [[Cyprus]]. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, &quot;Lycka&quot;, which was to be released in September 1970. Fältskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of them working together saw them launch a stage act, &quot;Festfolk&quot;, which translates from Swedish to mean both &quot;Party People&quot; and &quot;Engaged Couples&quot;, on 1 November 1970 in [[Gothenburg]]. The cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit &quot;''Hej, gamle man''&quot; (&quot;Hello, Old Man&quot;); the first Bjorn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.

====First record together &quot;Hej, gamle man&quot;====
&quot;Hej, gamle man&quot;, a song about an old Salvation Army soldier, became the quartet's first hit. The record was credited to '''Björn &amp; Benny''' and reached number 5 on the sales charts and number 1 on [[Svensktoppen]], staying there for 15 weeks.

In the first half of 1971, the four artists worked more together, adding vocals to the others' recordings. Fältskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own. Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=163–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forming the group (1970–1973)===
After the 1970 release of &quot;''Lycka''&quot;, two more singles credited to 'Björn &amp; Benny' were released in Sweden, &quot;''Det kan ingen doktor hjälpa''&quot; (&quot;No doctor can help with that&quot;) and &quot;''Tänk om jorden vore ung''&quot; (&quot;Imagine if the Earth were young&quot;), with more prominent vocals by Fältskog and Lyngstad–and moderate chart success.

Fältskog released her fourth album in 1971 and married Ulvaeus on 6 July 1971. Andersson, Ulvaeus, and Fältskog started performing together on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks during the summer of 1971.

[[Stig Anderson]], founder and owner of Polar, was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. &quot;One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit&quot;, he predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stig encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for [[Melodifestivalen]], and after two rejected entries in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song &quot;''Säg det med en sång''&quot; (&quot;Say It With A Song&quot;) for the 1972 contest, and they chose newcomer Lena Anderson to perform. The song won third place, encouraging Stig, and became a hit in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first signs of foreign success came as a surprise, as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single &quot;She's My Kind of Girl&quot; was released by [[Epic Records|Epic]] in Japan in March 1972, giving the duo a Top 10 hit. Two more singles were released in Japan, &quot;En Carousel&quot;&lt;!-- When the song was released in Japan for the first time, its title was a &quot;En Carousel&quot;, not &quot;En Karusell&quot;. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1149457 |title=Cover art for Björn and Benny single &quot;En Carousel&quot;/&quot;Lycka&quot; |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;En Karusell&quot; in Scandinavia, an earlier version of &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;) and &quot;Love Has Its Ways&quot; (a song they wrote with [[Koichi Morita (songwriter)|Koichi Morita]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First hit as 'Björn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid'====
Ulvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements. &quot;[[People Need Love]]&quot; was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence. Stig released it as a single, credited to '''Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid'''. The song reached #17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at #114 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] singles chart and #117 on [[Record World]]'s singles chart. Billed as '''by Björn &amp; Benny (with Svenska Flicka)''', it was released there on [[Playboy Records]]. However, according to Stig Anderson, &quot;People Need Love&quot; could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with ''Songwriter'' magazine, 6, 1981, pp.23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foursome decided to record their first album together in the autumn of 1972, and sessions began on 26 September 1972. The women shared lead vocal on &quot;Nina, Pretty Ballerina&quot; that day, and their voices in harmony for the first time gave the foursome an idea of the quality of their combined talents.

====&quot;Ring Ring&quot;====
For 1973, the band and their manager Stig decided to have another try at Melodifestivalen, this time with the song &quot;[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]&quot;. The studio sessions were handled by [[Michael B. Tretow]], who experimented with a &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; production technique that became the wholly new ABBA sound. Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by [[Neil Sedaka]] and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a surefire winner, but in Melodifestivalen, on 10 February 1973, it was placed third, and thus never reached the international Eurovision Song Contest. Nevertheless the proto-group put out their first album, called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''. The album did well and the &quot;Ring Ring&quot; single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa. However, Stig Anderson felt the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=191–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Official naming====
In early 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA. At first, this was a play on words, as [[Abba Seafood|Abba]] is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an acronym. However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets. A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper. The group was impressed with the names &quot;Alibaba,&quot; &quot;FABB,&quot; and &quot;Baba&quot;, but in the end all the entries were ignored and it was announced in the summer that the name &quot;ABBA&quot; was official. Later the group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;ABBA&quot; is an [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid.&lt;ref name=&quot;official_bio_2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= ABBA's biography, page 2|work= www.abbasite.com|url= http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&amp;page=2|accessdate= 16 January 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first 'B' in the logo version of the name was &quot;mirror-image&quot; reversed on the band's promotional material from 1976 onwards and became the group's [[registered trademark]].

The first time the name is found written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in [[Stockholm]], dated 16 October 1973. This was first written as &quot;Björn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida&quot;, but was subsequently crossed out with &quot;ABBA&quot; written in large letters on top.

The official logo, using the bold version of the [[News Gothic]] typeface, was designed by Rune Söderqvist, and appeared for the first time on the [[Dancing Queen]] single in August 1976, and subsequently on all later original albums and singles. But the idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang Heilemann on a &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; shoot for the teenage magazine [[BRAVO]]. On the photo, every ABBA-member held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that one of the men held his letter backwards. They discussed it and the members of ABBA liked it. Following their acquisition of the group's catalogue, Polygram began using variations of the ABBA logo, using a different font and adding a crown emblem to it in 1992 for the first releases of 'ABBA Gold'. When Universal Music purchased Polygram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalogue was returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abbamail.com/feature/logo25th.htm] ABBA Logo 25th Anniversary.{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough (1973–1976)===
====Eurovision====
For their first [[Eurovision]], ABBA entered with &quot;[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]&quot; but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry; it came third in the preliminary round. Stig immediately started planning for the 1974 contest.

Ulvaeus, Andersson, and Stig believed in the possibilities of using [[Melodifestivalen]] and Eurovision TV contests as a way to make the music business aware of the band and Andersson, Ulvaeus and Stig as composers. In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the [[1974 Eurovision Song Contest]] and from a number of newly written compositions, the foursome chose the upbeat &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot;; the group was now inspired by the growing [[glam rock]] scene in England. &quot;Waterloo&quot; was an unashamedly glam-style pop track produced with Michael B. Tretow's wall-of-sound approach.

ABBA won their national heats on Swedish TV on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the international contest. Winning the Eurovision Song Contest gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major TV shows; thus the band saw the &quot;Waterloo&quot; single climb the charts in many European countries. &quot;Waterloo&quot; was ABBA's first number one single in big markets such as the UK, Germany and Australia. In the US, it reached #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there. Albeit a short promotional visit, it included their first performance on American TV, [[The Mike Douglas Show]]. The ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' album only peaked at #145 on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart, but received unanimous high praise from the US critics: [[Los Angeles Times]] called it &quot;a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively...an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project&quot;, while [[Creem]] characterized it as &quot;a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions&quot;.

ABBA's follow-up single, &quot;[[Honey, Honey]]&quot;, reached #27 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]], and was #2 in Germany. However, in the UK, ABBA's British record company, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of &quot;Ring Ring&quot; instead of &quot;Honey Honey&quot;, and a cover version of &quot;Honey Honey&quot; by the act Sweet Dreams reached #10. Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other. &quot;Ring Ring&quot; failed to reach the Top 30 in the UK, increasing growing speculation that the group were simply Eurovision [[one-hit wonder]]s.

====Post-Eurovision====
In November 1974, ABBA embarked on their first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany, and Austria. It was not as successful as the band had hoped, since most of the venues did not sell out. Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland. The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was different. They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for. Live performances continued during the summer of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a sixteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland. Their [[Stockholm]] show at the [[Gröna Lund]] amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 ''So Long'' was released as a single in the UK but it received no airplay from Radio 1 and failed to chart. In the summer of 1975 they released &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot;, which again received little airplay on radio 1 but managed to climb the charts, to #38. Later in 1975 the release of their next album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and single &quot;[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]&quot; brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit #6 and the album reached #13. SOS also became ABBA's second number 1 single in both Germany and Australia. Success was further solidified with &quot;[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]&quot; reaching the #1 spot in the UK, Germany, and Australia in January 1976. In the US, &quot;[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]&quot; reached #10 on the [[Record World]] Top 100 singles chart and #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, picking up the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975.

The success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases. By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack. The eponymous ''ABBA '' album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at #165 on the ''Cashbox'' album chart and #174 on the Billboard 200 chart. Opinions were voiced, by ''Creem'' in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured &quot;a very sloppy promotional campaign&quot;. The group, however, enjoyed warm reviews from American press. ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' went as far as saying that &quot;there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abba's marketing, creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts&quot;, while ''Creem'' wrote: &quot;SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles&quot;.

In Australia, the airing of the music videos for &quot;[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]&quot; on nationwide TV in August 1975 started an immense interest for ABBA, resulting in #1 positions on both the single and album charts for months.

===Superstardom (1976–1981)===
In March 1976, the band released the compilation ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'', despite having had only six Top 40 hits in the UK and the US. Nevertheless, it became their first UK #1 album, and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time, eventually selling more than a million copies there. At the same time, Germany released a compilation named ''The Very Best of ABBA'', also becoming a #1 album there whereas the ''Greatest hits'' LP followed a few months later to #2 on the German charts, despite all similarities with &quot;The Very Best&quot; album. Also included on ''Greatest Hits'' was a new single, &quot;[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]&quot;, which had first been written by Ulvaeus and Andersson in Swedish for Lyngstad's #1 1975 solo album ''[[Frida ensam]]'' (''Frida alone''). After Lyngstad's huge success with the song in Sweden, the group decided to record an English version. &quot;Fernando&quot; took the world by storm, hitting #1 in at least thirteen countries worldwide, including the UK, Germany and Australia and the single went to sell over 10&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Karen Collins |url=http://www.tagg.org/mmmsp/fernando.html |title=Fernando the Flute&amp;nbsp;– Details |publisher=Tagg.org |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the song occupied the top position during 14 weeks, and stayed in the Australian charts for 40 weeks, tying [[The Beatles]] for longest number one for &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot;, making &quot;Fernando&quot; one of the bestselling singles of all time in Australia. That same year, the group received its first international prize, with &quot;Fernando&quot; being chosen as the &quot;Best Studio Recording of 1975&quot;. In the US, &quot;Fernando&quot; reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the [[Billboard Adult Contemporary]] chart, ABBA's first American number one single of any kind.

The group's next album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', a #1 bestseller all over Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', and mostly appreciative notices from American critics. Hit after hit flowed from ''Arrival'': &quot;[[Money, Money, Money]]&quot;, another #1 in Germany and Australia, and &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]&quot;, ABBA's sixth consecutive German #1 as well as another UK #1. The real sensation was &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot;, not only topping the charts in the loyal markets UK, Germany and Australia, but also reaching #1 in the US. In South Africa ABBA had astounding success with &quot;Fernando&quot;, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; being among the top 20 bestselling singles for 1976–77. In 1977 ''Arrival'' was nominated for the inaugural [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]] in the category &quot;Best International Album of the Year&quot;. By this time ABBA were popular in the UK, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
In [[Frida the dvd]], Lyngstad explains how she and Fältskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years.

Their popularity in the US would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; became the only Billboard Hot 100 #1 single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the #1 position on other ''Billboard'' charts, including Billboard Adult Contemporary and [[Hot Dance Club Play]]). Nevertheless, ''Arrival'' finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at #20 on the Billboard 200 album chart and was certified gold by [[RIAA]].

====European and Australian tour====
In January 1977, ABBA hit the road. The group's status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. They opened their much anticipated tour in [[Oslo]], Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-penned mini-operetta &quot;The Girl With The Golden Hair. &quot; The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe visiting [[Gothenburg]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Antwerp]], [[Essen]], [[Hanover]], [[Hamburg]], and ended it with shows in the UK in [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]] and two sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. Along with praise (&quot;Abba turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records&quot;, wrote ''[[Creem (magazine)|Creem]]''), there were complaints that &quot;Abba performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage&quot; (''[[Melody Maker]]''). One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', though it is not known exactly how much of the concert was filmed.

[[File:Abba 28011977 15 200.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Agnetha Fältskog]] at the opening concert of ABBA's European &amp; Australian Tour in [[Oslo]], 28 January 1977.]]
After the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played eleven dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] on 3 March before over 20,000 was marred by torrential rain and Frida slipped on the wet stage during the concert. However, all four members would later recall this concert to be the most memorable of their career. Upon their arrival in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], a civic reception was held at the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000&amp;nbsp;people. In Melbourne, ABBA played three concerts at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]] with 14,500 at each including the [[Australian Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]] and his family. At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000&amp;nbsp;people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert. In [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]], the group performed one concert at [[AAMI Stadium|West Lakes Football Stadium]] before 20,000&amp;nbsp;people with another 10,000 listening outside. During the first five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the Entertainment Centre. The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention (&quot;Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour...and the media coverage of the quartet rivals that set to cover the upcoming Royal tour of Australia&quot;, wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''), and is captured on film in ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', directed by [[Lasse Hallström]].

The Australian tour and its subsequent ''ABBA: The Movie'' produced some ABBA lore, as well. Agnetha Fältskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's 'pin-up girl', a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline &quot;Agnetha's bottom tops dull show&quot;. When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: &quot;Don't they have bottoms in Australia?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DVD documentaries: ''The Winner Takes It All'' (2002) and ''Super Troupers'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1977, ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more ambitious fifth album ''[[The Album (ABBA album)|The Album]]'', released to coincide with the debut of ''ABBA: The Movie''. Although the album was less well-received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: &quot;[[The Name of the Game]]&quot; and &quot;[[Take a Chance on Me]]&quot;, both topped the UK charts, and reached #12 and #3 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US. Although &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single in the United States, selling more copies than &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Album'' also included the ABBA signature tune, &quot;[[Thank You for the Music]]&quot;, the B-side of &quot;[[Eagle (song)|Eagle]]&quot; in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and later released as an A-side single in the UK in 1983.

====Polar Music Studio formation====
[[File:Sportpalatset Stockholm 2010.jpg|thumb|Polar Music Studios was situated in this building at 58 Sankt Eriksgatan in Stockholm until 2004.]]
By 1978, ABBA was one of the biggest bands in the world. They converted a vacant movie theatre into the [[Polar Music]] Studio, a state-of-the-art studio in [[Stockholm]]. The studio was used by several other bands; notably, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' were recorded there. During May, the group went to the US for a promotional campaign, performing on [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s TV show. Recording sessions for &quot;[[Summer Night City]]&quot; were an uphill struggle, but upon release the song became another hit for the group. The track would set the stage for ABBA's foray into [[disco]] with their next album.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=383–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 1979, the group performed &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot; at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] held at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to celebrate UNICEF's Year of the Child. ABBA donated the [[copyright]] of this worldwide hit to the [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]; see [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bee Gees, Olivia were a hit with the VIPs&quot; (11 January 1979). ''Courier Mail'' (Brisbane); p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; The single was released the following week, and reached #1 in ten countries.

====North American and European tours====
In mid-January 1979, Ulvaeus and Fältskog announced they were getting divorced. The news caused interest from the media, and led to speculation about the band's future. ABBA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group, and that the divorce would not affect them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ABBA divorce&amp;nbsp;– Agnetha moves out&quot; (17 January 1979). ''The Sun'' (Sydney); p.&amp;nbsp;1.)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the media continued to confront them with this in interviews. To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Benny and Björn secretly traveled to [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], where for two weeks they prepared their next album's songs in relative quiet.

The group's sixth album, ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', was released in April 1979, the title track of which was recorded at the famous [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, U.S. with the assistance, among others, of [[recording engineer]] [[Tom Dowd]]. The album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico, hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the US. None of the singles from the album reached #1 on the UK charts, but &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot;, &quot;[[Does Your Mother Know]]&quot;, &quot;[[Angeleyes]]&quot; and &quot;[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]&quot; all charted no lower than #4. &quot;[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]&quot; was the exception, when the single reached #2 in UK and #1 on Eurochart Hot 100 singles. In Canada, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; became ABBA's second #1 on the [[RPM]] Adult Contemporary chart, after &quot;Fernando&quot; hit the top previously. Later that year, the group released their second compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'', which featured a brand new track: &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot;, another number 3 hit in both, the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, they were paid in oil commodities because of an [[embargo]] on the [[Soviet ruble|ruble]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Peter (16 March 1980). &quot;Pop goes ABBA's $2m oil gamble: ABBA may lose enormous amount of money following venture into oil market. &quot; ''The Sunday Times''; Business News, p&amp;nbsp;53)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 1979, ABBA began their [[ABBA: The Tour]] at the [[Rexall Place|Northlands Coliseum]] in [[Edmonton]], Canada, with a full house of 14,000. &quot;The voices of the band, Agnetha's high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning&quot;, raved ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''.
During the next four weeks, they played a total of seventeen sold-out dates, thirteen in the U.S. and four in Canada. The last scheduled ABBA concert on U.S. soil, in Washington, DC, was canceled due to Agnetha Fältskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston, when the private plane the group was on was subjected to [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado|extreme weather conditions]] and was unable to land for an extended period. They appeared on the [[Citi Performing Arts Center|Boston Music Hall]] stage for the performance ninety minutes late.
The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] before a capacity crowd of 18,000.
&quot;Abba plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone who's been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied&quot;, wrote ''[[Record World]]''.

On 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's [[Wembley Arena]].

====Progression====
[[File:Schallplatte.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', seventh studio album released by the group in 1980]]
In March 1980, ABBA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at [[Narita International Airport]], they were besieged by thousands of fans. The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]]. This tour was the last &quot;on the road&quot; adventure of their career. The same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release. Anticipation for the album had been built up by &quot;[[The Winner Takes It All]]&quot;, the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978). In the US, the single reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second Billboard Adult Contemporary #1. The song was allegedly written about Ulvaeus and Fältskog's marital tribulations. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse [[Mireille Mathieu]] at the end of 1980&amp;nbsp;– as &quot;Bravo Tu As Gagne&quot;, with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. The next single from the album, &quot;[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]&quot;, also hit #1 in the UK as well as in Germany, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from ''Super Trouper'', &quot;[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]&quot;, released in 1981 as a 12-inch single only in selected territories, managed to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at #7 on the UK singles chart becoming at the time the highest ever charting 12-inch release in UK chart history.

Also in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called ''[[Gracias Por La Música (album)|Gracias Por La Música]]''. It was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, this signalled the group's breakthrough in Latin America. &quot;ABBA ORO&quot; was released in 1999.

===Final album and performances (1981–1982)===
In January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena Källersjö, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party. For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track 'Hovas Vittne' (a pun on the Swedish name for [[Jehovah's Witness]] and Anderson's birthplace, [[Hova, Sweden|Hova]]) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectible. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona Nörklit, whom he married in November 1981.

Andersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions during the first months of 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March. At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, ''[[Dick Cavett meets ABBA]]'' with the US talk show host [[Dick Cavett]]. ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'', ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies. Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, aging, and loss of innocence. This change of content led to the release of the album ''The Visitors'' including the UK #3 single &quot;[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]&quot;, proving the last of ABBA's nine number 1 singles in Germany in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen top 5 singles on the charts in South Africa.

Although it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including the UK and Germany, ''The Visitors'' was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia or Japan. A track from ''The Visitors'', &quot;[[When All Is Said and Done (song)|When All Is Said and Done]]&quot;, was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the U.S. charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10 and #4 on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with &quot;[[The Winner Takes It All]]&quot; and &quot;[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]&quot;, dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the US was the title track of ''The Visitors'', which hit the Top Ten on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.

====Last recording sessions====
In the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested.
The recording sessions in May and June were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: &quot;You Owe Me One&quot;, &quot;I Am the City&quot;, and &quot;[[Just Like That (song)|Just Like That]]&quot;. Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=455–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]''.
New songwriting and recording sessions took place,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=456–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during October and November, they released the singles &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot;/&quot;[[Cassandra]]&quot; and &quot;[[Under Attack]]&quot;/&quot;You Owe Me One&quot;, the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the top 20 in the UK, though &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot; became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to #1 in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and West Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. The last single, &quot;Under Attack,&quot; hit the top 10 in about 3 European countries.

&quot;I Am the City&quot; and &quot;Just Like That&quot; were left unreleased on ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album from ABBA, though this never came to fruition. &quot;I Am the City&quot; was eventually released as a bonus track on the compilation album ''[[More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits|More ABBA Gold]]'' in 1993, while &quot;Just Like That&quot; has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus section of &quot;Just Like That&quot; was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994. Despite numerous requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of &quot;Just Like That&quot; in its entirety, even though the complete version surfaced on bootlegs.

The group travelled to London to promote ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' in the first week of November 1982, appearing on ''[[Saturday Superstore]]'' and ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme Nöjesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', via a live link from a TV studio in [[Stockholm]].

====Last performances====
Andersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with [[Tim Rice]] in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while Fältskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further cooperation between three of them came with the musical ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' that was produced in France for television. It was a children's musical utilising 14&amp;nbsp;ABBA songs. [[Alain Boublil|Alain]] and Daniel Boublil, who wrote ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyrics for Mirielle Mathieu's version of &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;.

Lyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, &quot;[[Belle]]&quot;, a duet with French singer [[Daniel Balavoine]]. The song was a cover of ABBA's instrumental 1976 track &quot;[[Arrival (song)|Arrival]]&quot;. As the single &quot;Belle&quot; sold well in France, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] wanted to stage an English language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, &quot;[[(I Am) The Seeker|The Seeker]]&quot;. &quot;Abbacadabra&quot; premièred 8 December 1983 at The Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was involved in this production as well, recording 'Belle' in English as &quot;Time&quot;; a duet with actor and singer [[B. A. Robertson]]: the single sold well, this time produced and recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus.

All four members made their last public appearance, as four friends more than as ABBA, in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of &quot;Tivedshambo&quot;, which was the first song written by their manager, Stig Anderson, for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, [[Claes af Geijerstam]]. They sang a self-composed song titled &quot;Der Kleine Franz&quot; that later was to surface in ''Chess''. The same year ''[[ABBA Live]]'' was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. They were guests on the 50th birthday of Görel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring Görel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song &quot;Med En Enkel Tulipan&quot; [[a cappella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raffem.com/BjornUlvaeusBiogr.htm] ABBA's last known appearance (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Andersson has on several occasions performed old ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Björn Ulvaeus appeared with [[U2]] at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot;, and a few years later during the final performance of the B &amp; B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]] band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot; with opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], and &quot;When All Is Said And Done&quot; with Swede [[Viktoria Tolstoy]]. Andersson and Ulvaeus both did an a cappella rendition of the first verse of &quot;Fernando&quot; as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London in 2002. Frida Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; with the Swedish group [[The Real Group]] in 1993, and has also re-recorded &quot;[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]&quot; with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.

===Breaking up===
ABBA has never officially announced the end of the group, but the group has long been considered dissolved. Their last public performance together ''as'' ABBA was on the British TV programme ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'' (live from Stockholm) 11 December 1982. In January 1983, Agnetha started recording sessions for a solo album, as Frida had successfully released her album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' some months earlier. Björn and Benny started songwriting sessions for the musical ''Chess'', and ABBA was shelved in the meantime. In interviews, Björn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (&quot;Who are we without our ladies? Initials of [[Brigitte Bardot]]?&quot;) and Frida and Agnetha kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the group sold their shares in [[Polar Music]] during 1983. With this, the foursome did not come together publicly until all four members were reunited at the Swedish premiere of ''Mamma Mia!'' on 4 July 2008. In an interview with the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', following the premiere, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson confirmed that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. &quot;We will never appear on stage again&quot;, Ulvaeus said. &quot;There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition. I remember [[Robert Plant]] saying [[Led Zeppelin]] were a cover band now because they cover all their own stuff. I think that hit the nail on the head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/05/bmabba105.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Anderson: We will never reform | first=Chris | last=Hastings | date=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on 3 January 2011, Agnetha, who has been long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and possibly also the major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement.  She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members.

===After ABBA===
====Andersson and Ulvaeus====
{{Main|1=Björn Ulvaeus|2=Benny Andersson}}
In October 1984, Ulvaeus and Andersson together with lyricist [[Tim Rice]] released the musical concept double album ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''. The singles &quot;[[One Night in Bangkok]]&quot; (with vocals by [[Murray Head]]) and &quot;[[I Know Him So Well]]&quot; (a duet by [[Barbara Dickson]] and [[Elaine Paige]] and later also recorded by both [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Whitney Houston]]) were both successes. In May 1986, the musical premièred in the West End of London, and ran for almost three years. On [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] it opened in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged &quot;''Chess på svenska''&quot; ('Chess in Swedish') in 2003, with some new material including the musical numbers &quot;''Han är en man, han är ett barn''&quot; (&quot;He's a man, he's a child&quot;) and &quot;''Glöm mig om du kan''&quot; (&quot;Forget me if you can&quot;).  In 2008 the musical was again revived for a successful staging at London's Royal Albert Hall which subsequently was released on DVD, and then in two successful separate touring productions in the US and UK, in 2010.

Andersson's and Ulvaeus' piece, ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'', an epic Swedish musical which the premiered in [[Malmö]] in southern Sweden in October 1995. It was directed for the stage by Lars Rudolfsson and based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' [[tetralogy]] by Swedish novelist [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. The musical ran for five years in Stockholm, and an English version has been in development for some considerable time. It has been reported that a Broadway production is in its earliest stages of pre-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icethesite.com/content/kristina.aspx |title=Kristina från Duvemåla&amp;nbsp;– The Musical |publisher=icethesite |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, following some earlier workshops, a full presentation of the English translation of the musical in concert, now with the shortened name of &quot;Kristina&quot;, has taken place to capacity crowds in September 2009 at New York's Carnegie Hall, and in April 2010 at London's Royal Albert Hall followed by a CD release of the New York recordings.

[[File:Benny Andersson ABBA.jpg|thumb|Benny Andersson during a performance in [[Minnesota]] 2006]]
Since 1983, besides ''Chess'' and ''Kristina från Duvemåla'', Benny Andersson has continued writing songs with Björn Ulvaeus. The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]] in 1985 and 1987. In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his own label, Mono Music, called &quot;''[[Klinga mina klockor]]''&quot; (&quot;Ring my bells&quot;), all new material inspired by Swedish folk music&amp;nbsp;– and followed it with his 2nd album titled ''[[November 1989 (album)|November 1989]]''.

In the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet [[Ainbusk|Ainbusk Singers]], giving them two hits: &quot;Lassie&quot; and &quot;''Älska mig''&quot; (&quot;Love me&quot;), and later produced ''[[Shapes (album)|Shapes]]'', an English-language album by the group's [[Josefin Nilsson]] with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to [[Roy Andersson]]'s ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''). In 2001, Andersson formed his own band, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]], which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio [[Svensktoppen]] charts; the song &quot;''Du är min man''&quot;, &quot;You Are My Man&quot;, sung by [[Helen Sjöholm]], spent ''278'' weeks there between 2004 and 2009 .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&amp;Artikel=454872 |title=Aktuell lista |publisher=sr.se |date= |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersson released his third album [[BAO 3]] in October 2007 with new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sjöholm and [[Tommy Körberg]], as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007 with an audience of 14,000.

[[File:Björn Ulveaus.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Björn Ulvaeus at [[Gothenburg Book Fair]] 2007]]
Björn Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of The Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of [[Västervik]], singing their 1966 hit &quot;Marianne&quot;.

Andersson and Ulvaeus are highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical [[Mamma Mia!]], alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres. They were also involved in the production of the successful film version of the musical, which opened in July 2008. Andersson produced the soundtrack utilising many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours. Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a 'fisherman' piano player in the 'Dancing Queen' scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing a lyre during the closing credits.

Andersson and Ulvaeus are continuously composing new material; most recently the two wrote the title track for Andersson's first international release, ''The Benny Andersson Band&amp;nbsp;– The Story Of a Heart'', released in July 2009. The album is a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases, including five songs now recorded in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's Ken Bruce Show Monday on 25 May. A Swedish-language version, &quot;Sommaren Du Fick&quot; ('The Summer You Got'), was released in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sjöholm. In the spring of 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel ''Hotel Rival'', titled &quot;[[2nd Best to None]]&quot;, accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008 the two wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]] titled &quot;''Jag vill bli gammal''&quot; (&quot;I Wanna Grow Old&quot;); for her Stockholm stage show &quot;Your Days Are Numbered&quot;. Björn also contributed lyrics to ABBAs 1976 instrumental track [[Arrival]] for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 '[[Winter Symphony]] album. New English lyrics have also been written for Bennys 1999 song 'Innan Gryningen' (also named 'Millennium Hymn'), new title &quot;The Silence Of The Dawn&quot; for [[Barbara Dickson]]. In 2007 they wrote the new songs &quot;''Han som har vunnit allt''&quot; (&quot;He Who's Won It All&quot;) for actor/singer [[Anders Ekborg]] and &quot;I Walk With You Mama&quot; and &quot;After the Rain&quot; for opera singer [[Anne Sofie Von Otter]] for her Andersson tribute album &quot;I Let The Music Speak&quot;.

====Fältskog and Lyngstad====
{{Main|1=Agnetha Fältskog|2=Anni-Frid Lyngstad}}
Both female members of ABBA pursued solo careers on the international scene after their work with ABBA. In 1982, Lyngstad chose [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]] to produce the album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' and unveiled the hit single and video &quot;[[I Know There's Something Going On]]&quot; in autumn of that year. The single became a #1 hit in France, where it spent five weeks at the top, Belgium, Switzerland and Costa Rica. The track reached #3 in Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Poland, and was also a Top 10 hit in Germany, Italy, South Africa and Finland. In the United States, the single reached #13. In all, &quot;I Know There's Something Going On&quot; sold 3.5&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide and is the biggest selling single any of the four members have had outside ABBA. Lyngstad's album sold 1.5&amp;nbsp;million copies internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sveriges Television]], documented this historical event, by filming the whole recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with Frida, Phil, Björn, and Benny as well as all the musicians. This documentary and the promotion videos from the album are included in ''[[Frida - The DVD]]''.

Frida's second solo album after ABBA was the experimental ''[[Shine (Frida album)|Shine]]'', produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]. &quot;Shine&quot; was recorded in Paris and released in 1984. &quot;Shine&quot; reached the Top 10 on the album charts in Sweden, Norway and Belgium and the Top 20 in the Netherlands. The leadsingle was the title track &quot;Shine&quot;. This album was Frida's final studio album release for twelve years. It featured &quot;Slowly&quot;, the last known Andersson-Ulvaeus composition to have been recorded by one of the former female ABBA vocalists. The promotion videos and clips for &quot;Shine&quot; are included in [[Frida - The DVD]].

Agnetha Fältskog followed in 1983 with the album ''[[Wrap Your Arms Around Me]]''. This included the hit single &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, which was a hit in Europe and Scandinavia, while the title track went to number 2 in South Africa. In the US, Fältskog scored a Billboard Top 30 hit with &quot;Can't Shake Loose&quot;. In Europe, the single &quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me&quot; was another successful hit, topping the charts in Belgium and Denmark, reaching the Top 5 in Sweden and the Netherlands and the Top 20 in Germany and France. Her album sold 1.2&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fältskog's second post-ABBA solo album was ''Eyes of a Woman'', released in March 1985, which reached #2 in Sweden and performed reasonably well in Europe. The first single from the album was her self-penned &quot;I Won't Let You Go&quot;. In November 1987, Fältskog released her third post-ABBA solo album, the [[Peter Cetera]]-produced ''[[I Stand Alone (Agnetha Fältskog album)|I Stand Alone]]'', (which also included the Billboard adult contemporary duet with Cetera, &quot;[[I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)]]&quot; as well as the European charting singles &quot;The Last Time&quot; and &quot;Let It Shine&quot;. The album sold very well in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at #1. Shortly after some minor European promotion for the album in early 1988, Fältskog withdrew from public life and halted her music career for a while. In 1996, she released her autobiography, ''As I Am'', and a compilation album featuring her solo hits alongside some ABBA classics. In 2004, she made a successful comeback, releasing the critically acclaimed album ''[[My Colouring Book]]'', which debuted at #1 in Sweden (achieving triple-platinum status), #6 in Germany, and #12 in the UK, winning a silver award, and achieving gold status in Finland. The single &quot;[[If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind]]&quot; (a cover of the Cilla Black 60s song) became Fältskog's biggest solo hit in the UK, reaching the #11 position. The single achieved the #2 spot in Sweden and was a hit throughout Scandinavia and Europe. A further single &quot;[[When You Walk in the Room]]&quot; was released and peaked at no. 34 in the UK. In January 2007, she sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy Körberg at the after party for the final showing of the musical, ''Mamma Mia!'', in Stockholm, at which Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus were also present.

In 1992 Frida was asked and chosen to be the chairperson for the environmental organisation &quot;Artister för miljön&quot; (Artists for the Environment) in Sweden. Frida accepted and became chairwoman for this organisation from 1992 to 1995. To mark her interests for the environment, she recorded the [[Julian Lennon]] song ''Saltwater'' and performed it live in Stockholm. She arranged and financed summer camps for poor children in Sweden, focusing on environmental and ecological issues. Her environmental work for this organisation led up to the decision to record again. ''[[Djupa andetag]]'' (''Deep Breaths'') was released towards the end of 1996 and became a success in Sweden, where it reached #1 and Scandinavia. The lyrics for the single from this album, &quot;Även en blomma&quot; (Even a Flower), deal with environmental issues. In 2004, Lyngstad recorded a song called &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot;, written especially for her and released with former [[Deep Purple]] member [[Jon Lord]]. The couple made several TV performances with this song in Germany. Lyngstad lives a low-profile life but occasionally appears at a party or charity function. On 26 August 1992, she married Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss von Plauen, of the German Reuss family. Von Plauen died of [[lymphoma]] at the age of 49. In addition to losing her husband, Lyngstad had also lost her daughter Lise-Lotte in a car crash a year earlier.

On 15 November 2005, due to Anni-Frid Lyngstad's 60th birthday, [[Universal Records|Universal]] released the ''Frida Box Set'', consisting of the solo albums she recorded for the Polar Label. Included is also the 3½ hour documentary [[Frida - The DVD]]. On this DVD, which covers Lyngstad's entire singing career, the viewer is guided by Frida herself through the years. From her TV debut in Sweden 1967 to the TV performances she made in Germany 2004, singing &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot; together with [[Jon Lord]] of rock group [[Deep Purple]]. Many rare clips are included in the set and each performance is explained by Lyngstad herself. The interview with Lyngstad was filmed in the [[Swiss Alps]], summer 2005.

===Revival===
The same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a 'tribute' show (a children's TV musical named ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' using 14 of ABBA's songs) spawned new interest in the group's music.

After receiving little attention during the mid 1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo [[Erasure]] who released a cover [[Extended play|EP]] featuring versions of ABBA's songs which topped the charts in early 1992. As [[U2]] arrived in [[Stockholm]] for a concert in June, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of ''[[ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', a new compilation album. The single ''[[Dancing Queen]]'' received radio airplay in the UK in summer 1992 to promote the upcoming ''Gold'' album, as a result of which the song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at #16.

The enormous interest in the ''Gold'' compilation saw the release of ''[[More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits]]'' in 1993.

In 1994, two Australian [[cult films]] caught the attention of the world's media, both focussing on admiration for ABBA: ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' and ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]''. The same year, ''[[Thank You for the Music (album)|Thank You for the Music]]'', a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members.

ABBA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts: [[Evan Dando]] of [[The Lemonheads]] recorded a cover version of &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=504}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinéad O'Connor]] and Boyzone's [[Stephen Gately]] have recorded &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot;, [[Tanita Tikaram]], and [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] paid tribute to &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot;, Cliff Richard covered &quot;[[Lay All Your Love On Me]]&quot;, while Dionne Warwick and Peter Cetera recorded their versions of &quot;[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]&quot;. U.S. alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; in concert appearances, while legendary English [[Latin pop]] songwriter [[Richard Daniel Roman]] has recognized ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] covered &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot; with slightly altered lyrics.

Two different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released. &quot;ABBA: A Tribute&quot; coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's &quot;One Of Us&quot;, Army Of Lovers &quot;Hasta Manana&quot;, Information Society's &quot;Lay All Your Love On Me&quot;, Erasure's &quot;Take A Chance On Me&quot; (with MC Kinky), and Frida's a cappella duet with The Real Group on &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled &quot;ABBAMANIA&quot;, with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all new cover versions, notable tracks were by Madness (&quot;Money, Money, Money&quot;), Culture Club (&quot;Voulez-Vous&quot;), The Corrs (&quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;), Steps (&quot;Lay All Your Love On Me&quot;, &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;) and a medley entitled &quot;Thank ABBA For The Music&quot; performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.

In Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 ''B &amp; B Concerts'': a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the composers through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but even hits from the 1960s and after ABBA. The concert was a success, released on CD, and later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts.

In 2000, ABBA were reported to have turned down an offer of approximately US$1,000,000,000 (one billion US dollars) to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424667/20000202/abba.jhtml] Basham, David. &quot;ABBA Nixes Billion-Dollar Offer To Reunite. &quot; MTV News.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, all four members of ABBA appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled &quot;Our Last Video Ever&quot;. Each of the four members of the group made a brief cameo role, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]] and even [[Iron Maiden]]'s [[Eddie the Head|Eddie]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release, retitled &quot;The Last Video&quot; at the request of the former ABBA members.

In 2005, all four members of ABBA appeared at the Stockholm premiere of the musical Mamma Mia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4263745.stm|title= Abba reunite for musical premiere|accessdate= 16 July 2008|date= 14 February 2005|publisher= BBC News | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 2008, all four ABBA members were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the film ''Mamma Mia!''. It was only the second time all of them had appeared together in public since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7491246.stm|title= Abba quartet at Mamma Mia showing|accessdate= 16 July 2008|date= 5 July 2008|publisher= BBC News | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the appearance, they re-emphasized that they intended never to officially reunite, citing the opinion of [[Robert Plant]] that the re-formed [[Led Zeppelin]] was more like a [[cover band]] of itself than the original band. Ulvaeus stated that he wanted the band to be remembered as they were during the peak years of their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7491908.stm|title= Abba will 'never' perform again |accessdate= 7 August 2008|date= 6 July 2008|publisher= BBC News | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compilation album ''[[ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', originally released in 1992, returned to number one in the UK album charts for the fifth time on 3 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20080804_abba.shtml|title= Abba are No. 1|accessdate= 7 August 2008|date= 4 August 2008|publisher= [[BBC 6 Music]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2008, the [[Mamma Mia! The Movie]] film soundtrack went to number 1 on the USA Billboard Charts. While ABBA were together, the highest album chart position they ever achieved in America was No. 14.

Most recently all eight studio albums, together with a ninth of rare tracks, have been released as ABBA [[The Album (ABBA album)|The Albums]] It hit several charts, peaking at #4 in Sweden and reaching the top 10 in several other European territories.

In 2008, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] Europe, in collaboration with [[Universal Music Group]] Sweden AB, released [[List of SingStar titles|SingStar ABBA]] on both [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]] video game systems as part of the [[SingStar]] music video games. The game features 20 ABBA songs on PS2 and 25 on PS3, most of them #1 hits.

On 22 January 2009, Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad showed up together to receive the Swedish music award &quot;Rockbjörnen&quot; (for &quot;lifetime achievement&quot;) and gave an interview onstage; the two wanted to express gratitude for the honorary award and to thank their fans.

On 25 November 2009, [[PRS for Music]] announced that the British public voted ABBA as the band they would most like to reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Published: 7:00&amp;nbsp;am GMT 25 November 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6646768/Abba-is-the-band-most-people-want-to-see-reform.html |title=Abba is the band most people want to see reform |publisher=Telegraph |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lay All Your Love On Me was ABBA's fourth No.1 single on Billboard charts topping its Hot Dance Club Play chart. Dancing Queen and Take A Chance On Me singles were certified gold (more than 1&amp;nbsp;million copies sold) by RIAA.

Nine ABBA albums made their way into the Top 100 on Billboard 200 album chart with seven of them getting into the Top 50. Four of those albums reached Top 20 with &quot;ABBA The Album&quot; at No.14 being the highest position. Five albums received RIAA gold (more than 500,000 copies sold) certification, and three acquired platinum (more than 1&amp;nbsp;million copies sold) status. ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits collection released in the US in 1993 became a 6-time platinum bestseller and topped Bilboard Top Pop Catalog Albums chart (it also reached No. 11 on a [[Billboard Comprehensive Albums]] chart).

==Fashion, videos, advertising campaigns==
ABBA were widely noted for the colourful and trend-setting costumes its members wore.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The videos that accompanied some of their biggest hits are often cited{{by whom|date=November 2010}} as being among the earliest examples of the genre. Most of ABBA's videos (and ''ABBA: The Movie'') were directed by [[Lasse Hallström]], who would later direct the films ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]''.

ABBA made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible. This was also done in an effort to minimize traveling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Fältskog and Ulvaeus had two young children and Fältskog, who was also [[Fear of flying|afraid of flying]], was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager, Stig Anderson, realized the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicize a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s-era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one singer's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.

In 1976, ABBA participated in a high-profile advertising campaign by the Matsushita Electric Industrial (today's [[Panasonic Corporation]]), which was designed to promote the brand [[National (brand)|&quot;National&quot;]]. This campaign was designed initially for Australia, where &quot;National&quot; was still the primary brand used by Matsushita, who had not introduced the &quot;[[Panasonic]]&quot; brand to Australia yet despite its widespread use in other parts of the world such as the United States. However, the campaign was also aired in Japan. Five commercials, each approximately one minute long, were produced, each using the &quot;National Song&quot; sung by ABBA, which used the melody and instrumental arrangement of [[Fernando (song)|Fernando]], adapted with new lyrics promoting National, and working in several slogans used by National in their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abba-world.net/phenomenon/national/national.htm |title=ABBA: The National Commercial |publisher=Abba-world.net |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Controversy==
In September 2010, band members Andersson and Ulvaeus criticized the far right [[Danish People's Party]] (DF) for using their hit Mamma Mia with modified lyrics at rallies. The band had threatened to sue the DF, saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party. Their record company Universal Music later said that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abba anger over Danish far-right's use of Mamma Mia|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11403230|accessdate=5 May 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''allegiance''' is a duty of fidelity said to be owed by a subject or a [[citizen]] to his/her [[state (polity)|state]] or [[Monarch|sovereign]].

==Etymology==
From Middle English ''ligeaunce'' (see medieval Latin ''ligeantia'', &quot;a  liegance&quot;). The ''al-'' prefix was probably added through confusion with another legal term, ''allegeance'', an &quot;allegation&quot; (the French ''allegeance'' comes from the English). ''Allegiance'' is formed from &quot;liege,&quot; from [[Old French]] ''liege'', &quot;liege, free&quot;, of Germanic origin. The connection with [[Latin]] ''ligare'', &quot;to bind,&quot; is erroneous.

==Usage==
The term ''allegiance'' was traditionally often used by English legal commentators in a larger sense, divided by them into natural and local, the latter applying to the deference which even a foreigner must pay to the institutions of the country in which he happens to live. However it is in its proper sense, in which it indicates national character and the subjection due to that character, that the word is more important.

In that sense it represents the [[feudal]] [[liege homage]], which could be due only to one lord, while simple [[homage]] might be due to every lord under whom the person in question held land.

==United Kingdom==
The English doctrine, which was at one time adopted in the United States, asserted that allegiance was indelible: &quot;Nemo potest exuere patriam&quot;. Accordingly, as the law stood before 1870, every person who by birth or [[naturalisation]] satisfied the conditions set forth, though he should be removed in infancy to another country where his family resided, owed an allegiance to the British crown which he could never resign or lose, except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of British territory in which he resided.

Allegiance is the tie which binds the subject to the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] in return for that protection which the Sovereign affords the subject. It was the mutual bond and obligation between monarch and subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their liege lord, because he should maintain and defend them (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525; ''China Navigation Co v Attorney-General'' (1932) 48 TLR 375; ''Attorney-General v Nissan'' [1969] 1 All ER 629; ''Oppenheimer v Cattermole'' [1972] 3 All ER 1106). The duty of the Crown towards its subjects is to govern and protect. The reciprocal duty of the subject towards the Crown is that of allegiance. 

At common law allegiance is a true and faithful obedience of the subject due to his Sovereign. As the subject owes to his king his true and faithful allegiance and obedience, so the Sovereign is to govern and protect his subjects, ''regere et protegere subdititos suos'', so as between the Sovereign and subject there is:

*''duplex et reciprocum ligamen; quia sicut subditus regi tenetur ad obedientiam, ita rex subdito tenetur ad protectionem; merito igitur ligeantia dicitur a ligando, quia continet in se duplex ligamen'' (''Calvin's Case'' (1608) 7 Co Rep 1a; Jenk 306; 2 State Tr 559; 77 ER 377).

Natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as the Sovereign is born, they owe allegiance and obedience (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525). Natural-born subjects owe allegiance wherever they may be. Where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)). 

Allegiance is owed both to the Sovereign as a natural person  and to the Sovereign in the political capacity (''Re Stepney Election Petition, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54 (per [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]] CJ)). Attachment to the person of the reigning Sovereign is not sufficient. Loyalty requires affection also to the office of the Sovereign, attachment to royalty, attachment to the law and to the constitution of the realm, and he who would, by force or by fraud, endeavour to prostrate that law and constitution, though he may retain his affection for its head, can boast but an imperfect and spurious species of loyalty (''R v O'Connell'' (1844) 7 ILR 261). 

There were four kinds of allegiances (''Rittson v Stordy'' (1855) 3 Sm &amp; G 230; ''De Geer v Stone'' (1882) 22 Ch D 243; ''Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 54 LT 684; ''Gibson, Gavin v Gibson'' [1913] 3 KB 379; ''Joyce v DPP'' [1946] AC 347; ''Collingwood v Pace'' (1661) O Bridg 410; ''Lane v Bennett'' (1836) 1 M &amp; W 70; ''Lyons Corp v East India Co'' (1836) 1 Moo PCC 175; ''Birtwhistle v Vardill'' (1840) 7 Cl &amp; Fin 895; ''R v Lopez, R v Sattler'' (1858) Dears &amp; B 525; Ex p Brown (1864) 5 B &amp; S 280); 

(a) ''Ligeantia naturalis, absoluta, pura et indefinita'', and this originally is due by nature and birthright, and is called ''alta ligeantia'', and those that owe this are called ''subditus natus'';

(b) ''Ligeantia acquisita'', not by nature but by acquisition or denization, being called a denizen, or rather denizon, because they are ''subditus datus''; 

(c) ''Ligeantia localis'', by operation of law, when a friendly alien enters the country, because so long as they are in the country they are within the Sovereign's protection, therefore they owe the Sovereign a local obedience or allegiance (''R v Cowle'' (1759) 2 Burr 834; ''Low v Routledge'' (1865) 1 Ch App 42; ''Re Johnson, Roberts v Attorney-General'' [1903] 1 Ch 821; ''Tingley v Muller'' [1917] 2 Ch 144; ''Rodriguez v Speyer'' [1919] AC 59; ''Johnstone v Pedlar'' [1921] 2 AC 262; ''R v Tucker'' (1694) Show Parl Cas 186; ''R v Keyn'' (1876) 2 Ex  D 63; ''Re Stepney Election Petn, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54);

(d) A legal obedience, where a particular law requires the taking of an oath of allegiance by subject or alien alike.

Natural allegiance was acquired by birth within the Sovereign's dominions (except for the issue of diplomats or of invading forces or of an alien in enemy occupied territory). The natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as they are born they owe by birthright allegiance and obedience to the Sovereign (''Ex p. Anderson'' (1861) 3 E &amp; E 487). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever they may be, so that where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)). 

Acquired allegiance was acquired by naturalisation or denization. Denization, or ''ligeantia acquisita'', appears to be threefold (''Thomas v Sorrel'' (1673) 3 Keb 143); 

*(a) absolute, as the common denization, without any limitation or restraint;
*(b) limited, as when the Sovereign grants letters of denization to an alien, and the alien's male heirs, or to an alien for the term of their life;
*(c) It may be granted upon condition, ''cujus est dare, ejus est disponere'', and this denization of an alien may come about three ways: by Parliament; by letters patent, which was the usual manner; and by conquest.

Local allegiance was due by an alien while in the protection of the Crown. All friendly resident aliens incurred all the obligations of subjects (''The Angelique'' (1801) 3 Ch Rob App 7). An alien, coming into a colony also became, temporarily a subject of the Crown, and acquired rights both within and beyond the colony, and these latter rights could not be affected by the laws of that colony (''Routledge v Low'' (1868) LR 3 HL 100; 37 LJ Ch 454; 18 LT 874; 16 WR 1081, HL; ''Reid v Maxwell'' (1886) 2 TLR 790; ''Falcon v Famous Players Film Co'' [1926] 2 KB 474). 

A resident alien owed allegiance even when the protection of the Crown was withdrawn owing to the occupation of an enemy, because the absence of the Crown's protection was temporary and involuntary (''de Jager v Attorney-Geneneral of Natal'' [1907] AC 326). 

Legal allegiance was due when an alien took an oath of allegiance required for a particular office under the Crown. 

By the [[Naturalisation Act 1870]], it was made possible for British subjects to renounce their nationality and allegiance, and the ways in which that nationality is lost are defined. So British subjects voluntarily naturalized in a foreign state are deemed aliens from the time of such naturalization, unless, in the case of persons naturalized before the passing of the act, they have declared their desire to remain British subjects within two years from the passing of the act. Persons who from having been born within British territory are British subjects, but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are British subjects by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality. [[Emigration]] to an uncivilized country leaves British nationality unaffected: indeed the right claimed by all states to follow with their authority their subjects so emigrating is one of the usual and recognized means of [[Colonialism|colonial]] expansion.

==United States==
The doctrine that no man can cast off his native allegiance without the consent of his sovereign was early abandoned in the United States, and on July 27, 1868, the day before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was adopted, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] declared in the preamble of the [[Expatriation Act]] that &quot;the right of [[expatriation]] is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,&quot; and (Section I) one of &quot;the fundamental principles of this government&quot; ([[United States Revised Statutes]], sec. 1999). Every natural-born citizen of a foreign state who is also an American citizen and every natural-born American citizen who is a citizen of a foreign land owes a double allegiance, one to the United States, and one to his homeland (in the event of an immigrant becoming a citizen of the US), or to his adopted land (in the event of an emigrant natural born citizen of the  US becoming a citizen of another nation). If these allegiances come into conflict, he or she may be guilty of treason against one or both. If the demands of these two sovereigns upon his duty of allegiance come into conflict, those of the United States have the paramount authority in American law; likewise, those of the foreign land have paramount authority in their legal system. In such a situation, it may be incumbent on the individual to [[abjure the realm|abjure]] one of his citizenships to avoid possibly being forced into situations where countervailing duties are required of him, such as might occur in the event of war.

==Oath of allegiance==
{{main|Oath of allegiance}}
The oath of allegiance is an [[oath]] of fidelity to the sovereign taken by all persons holding important public office and as a condition of naturalization. By ancient common law it might be required of all persons above the age of 12, and it was repeatedly used as a test for the disaffected. In England it was first imposed by statute in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]] (1558) and its form has more than once been altered since. Up to the time of the revolution the promise was, &quot;to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene [[honour]], and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defending him therefrom.&quot; This was thought to favour the doctrine of absolute non-resistance, and accordingly the convention parliament enacted the form that has been in use since that time - &quot;I do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty ...&quot;

==In Islam==
{{anchor|Bayat}}
The [[Islam]]ic word for allegiance is ''bay'at'' (Arabic: بيعة), which means &quot;taking hand&quot;. The practice is sanctioned in the [[Qur'an]] by Surah 48:10: &quot;Verily, those who give thee their allegiance, they give it but to Allah Himself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Whitehouse |first= Bill |title= Reality Without A Name |origyear= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=yVUCCnhTiHcC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=surah+48:10&amp;sig=IaP414yDD-v8uaYF8yEG-Qtkucc |format= PDF: Google Books |accessdate= 2008-03-31 |publisher= Bilquees Press |location= |language= |isbn= 0-9680995-6-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 266 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word is used for the [[oath]] of allegiance to an [[emir]]. It is also used for the initiation ceremony specific to many [[Sufi]] orders.

An '''absolute majority''' or '''majority of the entire membership''' is a [[voting basis]] that usually requires that more than half of ''all'' the members of a group (including those absent and those present but not voting) to vote in favour of a proposition in order for it to be passed. In practical terms, it may mean that abstention from voting is be equivalent to a ''no'' vote.

Absolute majority can be contrasted with [[simple majority]] which only requires a majority of those actually voting to approve a proposition for it to be enacted.

Absolute-majority voting is most often used to pass significant changes to constitutions and to by-laws, in order to ensure that there is substantial support for a proposal.

If a political party has an absolute majority, it has more voting members than a simple [[quorum]]; this often gives the party additional powers, such as overriding a [[veto]] and blocking a [[filibuster]].

The '''MessagePad''' was the first series of [[personal digital assistant]] devices developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for the [[Newton (platform)|Newton platform]] in 1993. &lt;!--Development was started in 1989 (as Walter Smith, one of the original developers, said on the Worldwide Newton Conference 2006 - the video can be found on YouTube.) and officially ended on February 27, 1998.--&gt; Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's MessagePad devices was done in [[Japan]] by the [[Sharp Corporation]]. The devices were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor and all featured [[handwriting recognition]] software and were developed and marketed by Apple.&lt;!--(this includes the whole MessagePad line and the eMate 300), however other companies, notably Sharp, Motorola and Digital Ocean, also released their own. None of them was as successful as Apple's devices, though.--&gt; The devices ran the [[Newton OS]].

==Details==
=== Screen and input ===
With the MessagePad 120 with [[Newton OS]] 2.0, the Newton Keyboard by Apple became available, which can also be used via the dongle on Newton devices with a Newton InterConnect port, most notably the Apple MessagePad 2000/2100 series, as well as the Apple [[eMate 300]].

Newton devices featuring Newton OS 2.1 or higher can be used with the screen turned horizontally (&quot;landscape&quot;) as well as vertically (&quot;portrait&quot;). A change of a setting rotates the contents of the display by 90, 180 or 270 degrees. Handwriting recognition still works properly with the display rotated, although display calibration is needed when rotation in any direction is used for the first time or when the Newton device is reset.

====Handwriting recognition====
{{Main|Newton OS}}
In initial versions (Newton OS 1.x) the handwriting recognition gave extremely mixed results for users and was sometimes inaccurate. The original handwriting recognition engine was called Calligrapher, and was licensed from a Russian company called Paragraph International. Calligrapher's design was quite sophisticated; it attempted to learn the user's natural handwriting, using a database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing, and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen, whether hand-printed, in [[cursive]], or a mix of the two. By contrast, [[Palm Pilot|Palm Pilot's]] Graffiti had a less sophisticated design than Calligrapher, but was sometimes found to be more accurate and precise due to its reliance on a fixed, predefined stroke alphabet. The stroke alphabet used letter shapes which resembled standard handwriting, but which were modified to be both simple and very easy to differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grot.com/zoomer/zoomer-list/zoomer-list-3Q1994/0048.html Graffiti Accuracy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palm, Inc.|Palm Computing]] also released two versions of Graffiti for Newton devices. Ironically, the Newton version sometimes performed better and could also show strokes as they were being written as input was done on the display itself, rather than on a silkscreen area.

For editing text, Newton had a very intuitive system for handwritten editing, such as scratching out words to be deleted, circling text to be selected, or using written [[caret]]s to mark inserts.&lt;ref&gt;Read about HWR, ink text, Sketches, &amp; Shapes in Apple's [http://manuals.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Manuals/newton/0307258ANEWTONMP.PDF MessagePad Handbook] available in Apple's [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=50092 Newton Manuals] collection&lt;/ref&gt;

Later releases of the [[Newton OS|Newton operating system]] retained the original recognizer for compatibility, but added a hand-printed-text-only (not [[cursive]]) recognizer, called &quot;[[Rosetta (Newton)|Rosetta]]&quot;, which was developed by Apple, included in version 2.0 of the [[Newton OS|Newton operating system]], and refined in Newton 2.1. Rosetta is generally considered a significant improvement and many reviewers, testers, and most users consider the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives even 10 years after it was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;HWR accuracy:

&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as &quot;1 + 2 =&quot; was also under development but never released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marc.info/?l=newtontalk&amp;m=116284333623124]&lt;/ref&gt; However, users wrote similar programs which could evaluate mathematical formulas using the Newton OS Intelligent Assistant, a unique part of every Newton device.

The handwriting recognition and parts of the user interface for the Newton are best understood in the context of the broad history of [[Pen computing]], which is quite extensive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/penhist.html Notes on the (relatively unknown) History of Pen-based Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rwservices.no-ip.info:81/biblio.html Annotated Bibliography in Pen Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vital feature of the Newton handwriting recognition system is the [[modeless]] [[Error detection and correction|error correction]]. That is, correction done [[in situ]] without using a separate window or widget, using a minimum of gestures. If a word is recognized improperly, the user could double-tap the word and a list of alternatives would pop up in a menu under the stylus. Most of the time, the correct word will be in the list. If not, a button at the bottom of the list allows the user to edit individual characters in that word. Other pen gestures could do such things as transpose letters (also [[in situ]]).  The correction popup also allowed the user to revert to the original, un-recognized letter shapes - this would be useful in note-taking scenarios if there was insufficient time to make corrections immediately. To conserve memory and storage space, alternative recognition hypotheses would not be saved indefinitely. If the user returned to a note a week later, for example, they would only see the best match. Error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process, greatly increasing the interruption to a user's workflow that a given correction requires.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

====User interface====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Apple newton messagepad mixed note jk.jpg|right|thumbnail|Newton screen displaying a Note with text, &quot;ink text&quot;, a sketch, &amp; [[Vector graphics|vectorized]] shapes]] --&gt;
Text could also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on-screen pop-up [[QWERTY]] [[virtual keyboard]], although more layouts were developed by users. Newton devices could also accept free-hand &quot;Sketches&quot;, &quot;Shapes&quot;, and &quot;Ink Text&quot;, much like a desktop computer [[graphics tablet]]. With &quot;Shapes&quot;, Newton could recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle, a line, a [[polygon]], etc., and it would clean them up into perfect [[vector graphics|vector]] representations (with modifiable control points and defined vertices) of what the user was attempting to draw. &quot;Shapes&quot; and &quot;Sketches&quot; could be [[image scaling|scaled]] or deformed once drawn. &quot;Ink text&quot; captured the user's free-hand writing but allowed it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes (&quot;ink text&quot; supported [[word wrap]], could be formatted to be bold, italic, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pencomputing.com/developer/newton_20.html Pen Computing's First Look at Newton OS 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; At any time a user could also direct their Newton device to recognize selected &quot;ink text&quot; and turn it into recognized text (deferred recognition). A Newton note (or the notes attached to each contact in Names and each Dates calendar or to-do event) could contain any mix of interleaved text, Ink Text, Shapes, and Sketches.

===Connectivity===
The MessagePad 100 series of devices used the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]-standard [[serial port]]s&amp;mdash;round [[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN 8 connectors]]. The MessagePad 2000/2100 models (as well as the eMate 300) have a small, proprietary ''Newton InterConnect'' port. However, the development of the [[Newton (platform)|Newton hardware/software platform]] was canceled by [[Steve Jobs]] on February 27, 1998, so the InterConnect port, while itself very advanced, can only be used to connect a serial dongle. A prototype multi-purpose InterConnect device containing serial, audio in, audio out, and other ports was also discovered. In addition, all Newton devices have [[infrared]] connectivity, initially only the Sharp [[Amplitude-shift keying|ASK]] protocol, but later also [[IrDA]], though the Sharp ASK protocol was kept in for compatibility reasons. Unlike the Palm Pilot, all Newton devices are equipped with a standard [[PC Card]] expansion slot (two on the 2000/2100). This allows native modem and even [[Ethernet]] connectivity; Newton users have also written [[device driver|drivers]] for [[802.11b]] wireless networking cards and ATA-type [[flash memory]] cards (including the popular [[CompactFlash]] format), as well as for [[Bluetooth]] cards. Newton can also dial a phone number through the built-in speaker of the Newton device by simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker and transmitting the appropriate tones. Fax and printing support is also built in at the operating system level, although it requires peripherals such as parallel adapters, PCMCIA cards, or serial modems, the most notable of which is the lightweight Newton Fax Modem released by Apple in 1993. It is powered by 2 AA batteries, and can also be used with a power adapter. It provides data transfer at 2400 bps, and can also send and receive fax messages at 9600 and 4800 bps respectively.

===Power options===
The original Apple MessagePad and MessagePad 100 used four [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]]. They were eventually replaced by AA batteries with the release of the Apple MessagePad 110.

The use of 4 [[AA battery|AA]] [[NiCd]] (MessagePad 110, 120 and 130) and 4x AA [[NiMH]] cells (MP2x00 series, [[eMate 300]]) give a runtime of up to 30 hours (MP2100 with two 20&amp;nbsp;MB [[Linear Flash]] memory [[PC Card]]s, no backlight usage) and up to 24 hours with backlight on. While adding more weight to the handheld Newton devices than AAA batteries or custom battery packs, the choice of an easily replaceable/rechargeable cell format gives the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply. This, together with the [[flash memory]] used as internal storage starting with the Apple MessagePad 120 (if all cells lost their power, no data was lost due to the non-volatility of this storage), gave birth to the slogan &quot;Newton never dies, it only gets new batteries&quot;.

===Later efforts and improvements===
The Apple MessagePad 2000/2100, with a vastly improved handwriting recognition system, 162&amp;nbsp;MHz [[StrongARM]] SA-110 [[RISC]] processor, Newton OS 2.1, and a better, clearer, backlit screen, attracted critical plaudits. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
&lt;!--[[File:Applenewton emate300.jpg|thumb|left|''The [[eMate 300]]'']]
====eMate 300====
{{main|eMate 300}}
The [[eMate 300]] was a Newton device in a laptop form factor offered to schools in 1997 as an inexpensive ($799 US, originally sold to education markets only) and durable computer for classroom use. However, in order to achieve its low price, the eMate 300 did not have all the speed and features of the contemporary MessagePad equivalent, the MessagePad 2000. The eMate was cancelled along with the rest of the Newton products in 1998. It is the only Newton device to use the ARM710 microprocessor (running at 25 MHz), have an integrated keyboard, use Newton OS 2.2 (officially numbered 2.1), and its batteries are officially irreplaceable, although several users replaced them with longer-lasting ones without any damage to the eMate hardware whatsoever.

====Prototypes====
Many prototypes of additional Newton devices were spotted. Most notable was a Newton tablet or &quot;slate&quot;, a large, flat screen that could be written on. Others included a &quot;Kids Newton&quot; with side handgrips and buttons, &quot;VideoPads&quot; which would have incorporated a video camera and screen on their flip-top covers for two-way communications, the &quot;Mini 2000&quot; which would have been very similar to a Palm Pilot, and the NewtonPhone developed by [[Siemens AG]], which incorporated a handset and a keyboard.--&gt;

===Cases===
Apple and third parties marketed several &quot;wallets&quot; (cases) for the handheld Newton devices, which would hold them securely along with the owner's credit cards, driver's license, business cards, and cash. Most also protected the LCD screen. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} &lt;!-- The MessagePad has a receiver in the middle back to accept a pin that was mounted on the case. This allowed the Newton to be held by the case without the use of adhesives or straps. --&gt; &lt;!-- This fact needs to be verified. My MessagePad 120 has no other receivers other than the one for the charging station. ~HorvatM --&gt;

==Market reception==
&lt;!--Although the Newton platform was developed and marketed for six years, it was never as successful in the marketplace as Apple had hoped. This was because the technology was too advanced for the time, as the concept of soups, stores, and packages shows.

--&gt;The original Apple MessagePad and MessagePad 100 were limited by the very short lifetime of their inadequate AAA batteries.

[[File:Newton eat up martha.jpg|thumb|right|The Original Apple Newton's handwriting recognition was made light of in [[The Simpsons]] episode ''[[Lisa on Ice]]'']]
Critics also panned the [[handwriting recognition]] that was available in the debut models, which had been trumpeted in the Newton's marketing campaign.  It was this problem that was skewered in the [[Doonesbury]] comic strips&lt;ref name=&quot;doonesbury&quot;&gt;[http://images.ucomics.com/comics/db/1993/db930827.gif Egg freckles comic strip]&lt;/ref&gt; and the animated television series [[The Simpsons]]. Not even the word 'freckles' was in the dictionary, though the user could add it themselves. The real case was that the advanced Calligrapher handwriting recognition software needed to adjust to the user's handwriting; this process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months.

Another factor which limited the early Newton devices' appeal was that desktop connectivity was not included in the basic retail package, a problem that was later solved with 2.x Newton devices - these were bundled with a serial cable and the appropriate Newton Connection Utilities software.

Later versions of Newton OS offered improved handwriting recognition, quite possibly a leading reason for the continued popularity of the devices among Newton users. Even given the age of the hardware and software, Newtons still demand a sale price on the used market far greater than that of comparatively aged PDAs produced by other companies. In 2006 [[CNET]] compared an Apple MessagePad 2000 to a [[Samsung Q1]], and the Newton was declared better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalliving.cnet.co.uk/specials/0,39030785,49282099-1,00.htm Apple Newton vs Samsung Q1 UMPC , Special Features at CNET.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[CNET]] compared an Apple MessagePad 2000 to an [[iPhone]], and the Newton was still declared better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/0,39029552,49304363-1,00.htm Apple Newton vs iPhone]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes:''' The eMate 300 actually has ROM chips silked screened with 2.2 on them. Stephanie Mak on her website [http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/otheremate.html] discusses this:
If one removes all patches to the eMate 300 (by replacing the ROM chip, and then putting in the original one again, as the eMate and the MessagePad 2000/2100 devices erase their memory completely after replacing the chip), the result will be the Newton OS saying that this is version 2.2.00. Also, the Original MessagePad and the MessagePad 100 share the same model number, as they only differ in the ROM chip version. (The OMP has OS versions 1.0 to 1.05, or 1.10 to 1.11, while the MP100 has 1.3 that can be upgraded with various patches.)

{{Timeline of Newton models}} &lt;!-- This timeline should be renamed to &quot;Timeline of Apple's Newton devices&quot; -HorvatM --&gt;
&lt;!--
===Third party licenses===
The [[Newton OS]] was also licensed to a number of third party developers including Sharp and Motorola who developed additional PDA devices based on the Newton platform. Motorola added wireless connectivity, as well as made a unique two-part design, and shipped additional software with its Newton device, called the Marco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/marco.htm Motorola's 'Marco' Wireless Communicator]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp developed a line of Newton devices called the ExpertPad PI-7000/7100; those were the same as Apple's MessagePad and MessagePad 100, the only difference is the physical design (the ExpertPads feature a screen lid, which Apple added in 1994 with the release of the MessagePad 110) and the naming.--&gt;

==Other uses==
[[File:PSAINS InteractStation7.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Petrosains uses Newton technology.]]
There were a number of projects that used the Newton as a portable information device in cultural settings such as museums. For example, Visible Interactive created a walking tour in San Francisco's Chinatown but the most significant effort took place in [[Malaysia]] at the [[Petronas]] Discovery Center, known as Petrosains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petrosains.com.my/ Petrosains]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, an exhibit design firm, DMCD Inc., was awarded the contract to design a new 100,000 square foot (9300&amp;nbsp;m²) science museum in the [[Petronas Towers]] in Kuala Lumpur. A major factor in the award was the concept that visitors would use a Newton device to access additional information, find out where they were in the museum, listen to audio, see animations, control robots and other media, and to bookmark information for printout at the end of the exhibit.

The device became known as the ARIF, a Malay word for &quot;wise man&quot; or &quot;seer&quot; and it was also an acronym for A Resourceful Informative Friend. Some 400 ARIFS were installed and over 300 are still in use today.  The development of the ARIF system was extremely complex and required a team of hardware and software engineers, designers, and writers. ARIF is an ancestor of the PDA systems used in museums today and it boasted features that have not been attempted since.

'''Alfred Elton van Vogt''' (April 26, 1912&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 2000) was a Canadian-born [[science fiction author]] regarded by some as one of the most popular and complex&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although [van Vogt] catered for the pulps, he intensified the emotional impact and complexity of the stories they would bear[.]&quot; {{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origyear= 1995| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 1268|isbn= 978-0-312-13486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; science fiction writers of the mid-twentieth century: the &quot;[[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]]&quot; of the genre.

==Early life and writings==
Van Vogt was born on a farm in Edenburg, a [[Russian Mennonite]] community east of [[Gretna, Manitoba]], Canada. Until he was four years old, van Vogt and his family spoke only a dialect of Dutch in the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;pan&quot;&gt;Panshin, Alexei [http://www.enter.net/~torve/articles/vanvogt/vanvogt1.html “Man Beyond Man. The Early Stories of A. E. van Vogt” page 1] Retrieved on 2010-08-29&lt;/ref&gt; Van Vogt's father, a lawyer, moved his family several times and his son found these moves difficult, remarking in later life:

{{quote|Childhood was a terrible period for me. I was like a ship without anchor being swept along through darkness in a storm. Again and again I sought shelter, only to be forced out of it by something new.&lt;ref name=&quot;pan&quot;/&gt;}}

After starting his writing career by writing for &quot;true confession&quot; style [[pulp magazines]] like ''[[True Story (magazine)|True Story]]'', van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed, [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Jeffery: “An Interview with A. E. Van Vogt”, Science Fiction Review #23, 1977. Available online http://www.angelfire.com/art/megathink/vanvogt/vanvogt_interview.html Retrieved on 2010-08-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Vogt's first published SF story, &quot;Black Destroyer&quot; (''[[Analog Science Fiction|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', July 1939), was inspired by ''[[Voyage of the Beagle]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Drake, H. L.: &quot;A. E. van Vogt: Science Fantasy's Icon&quot;, page 36, Booklocker.com Inc, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The story depicted a fierce, carnivorous [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. It was the cover story &lt;ref&gt;Panshin, Alexei (1994) “Introduction to Slan”, The Easton press,  Connecticut, USA. Available on-line http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/intoslan.htm

{{quote|His first published SF story was &quot;Black Destroyer&quot; in the July 1939 Astounding, … Not only was &quot;Black Destroyer&quot; pictured on the cover of the magazine, but it would be recognized as one of the most significant stories published in Astounding that year.}}

[http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/voyageof.htm Image of Astounding cover ]&lt;/ref&gt; of the issue of ''Astounding'' that is sometimes described as having ushered in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Peter Nicholls ({{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origyear= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 199|isbn= 978-0-312-09618-2}}) says &quot;The beginning of Campbell's particular Golden Age of SF can be pinpointed as the summer of 1939,&quot; and goes on to begin the discussion with the July 1939 issue. Lester del Rey ({{cite book | first=Lester | last=del Rey |authorlink= Lester del Rey| title=The World of Science Fiction and Fantasy: The History of a Subculture| publisher=Ballantine Books | location=New York | year=1979 | page = 94|isbn= 978-0-345-25452-8}}) comments that &quot;July was the turning point&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;

{{quote|''Alien'' is thus virtually a film version or translation of &quot;Black Destroyer&quot;. (Van Vogt is not credited, and as it turns out he sued the film-makers for plagiarism; the latter settling out of court.|Fredric Jameson|''Archaeologies of the Future. The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions'' (New York: Verso, 2005, pp. 325)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 it was combined with &quot;War of Nerves&quot; (1950), &quot;Discord in Scarlet&quot; (1939) and &quot;M33 in Andromeda&quot; (1943) to form the novel ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' (1950).

In 1941, van Vogt decided to become a full-time writer, quitting his job at the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Canadian Department of National Defence]]. Extremely prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote a large number of [[short stories]]. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or &quot;[[fixup]]s&quot; as he called them, a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction criticism. When the original stories were related (e.g. ''[[The War against the Rull]]'') this was often successful. When not (e.g. ''[[Quest for the Future]]'') the disparate stories thrown together generally made for a less coherent plot.

One of van Vogt's best-known novels of this period is ''[[Slan]]'', which was originally serialised in ''Astounding Science Fiction'' (September - December 1940). Using what became one of van Vogt's recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

==Post-war philosophy==

In 1944, van Vogt moved to [[Hollywood, California]], where his writing took on new dimensions after [[World War II]]. Van Vogt was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern [[meta-systems]]) -- the characters in his very first story used a system called '[[Nexialism]]' to analyze the alien's behaviour, and he became interested in the [[General Semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]].

He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' and ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]'' in the late 1940s, and ''[[Null-A Three]]'' in the early 1980s. ''Null-A'', or [[non-Aristotelian logic]], refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], [[inductive reasoning]] (compare [[fuzzy logic]]), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, [[deductive reasoning]].

Van Vogt was also profoundly affected by revelations of [[totalitarian]] [[police state]]s that emerged after [[World War II]]. He wrote a mainstream novel that was set in Communist China, ''The Violent Man'' (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of &quot;the violent male type&quot;, which he described as a &quot;man who had to be right&quot;, a man who &quot;instantly attracts women&quot; and who he said were the men who &quot;run the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HLDrake&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, in his fiction, van Vogt was consistently sympathetic to absolute monarchy as a form of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;DK&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Knight|year=1967|title=In Search of Wonder|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case, for instance, in the ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher|Weapon Shop]]'' series, the ''[[The Mixed Men|Mixed Men]]'' series and in single stories such as &quot;Heir Apparent&quot;, whose protagonist was described as a &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;.

Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved. Several of his stories hinge upon temporal [[conundrum|conundra]], a favorite theme. He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books, &quot;''Narrative Technique''&quot; by [[Thomas Uzzell]], and &quot;''The Only Two Ways to Write a Story''&quot; plus &quot;''Twenty Problems of the Short-Story Writer''&quot;, both by [[John Gallishaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Panshin]], ''[http://www.enter.net/~torve/articles/vanvogt/vanvogt1.html The Abyss of Wonder, Man Beyond Man, The Early Stories of A. E. van Vogt]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He said many of his ideas came from dreams; throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90&amp;nbsp;minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmedia1980&quot;&gt;[[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Charles Platt]], ''[http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/Plattprofile.htm Who Writes SF?]'' Savoy Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of [[L. Ron Hubbard|L. Ron Hubbard's]] Dianetics operation in California.  [[Dianetics]] was the secular precursor to Hubbard's Church of [[Scientology]].  The operation went broke 9 months later, but never went bankrupt, due to van Vogt's arrangements with creditors.  Van Vogt and his wife opened their own Dianetics centre, partly financed by his writings, until he &quot;signed off&quot; around 1961.  At the time of his interview with Charles Platt,&lt;ref name=&quot;mmedia1980&quot;/&gt;  van Vogt was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors.  Between 1950 and 1960, van Vogt produced collections, notable [[fixup]]s such as: ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' (1952) and ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' (1959), and the two &quot;Clane&quot; novels, ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]'' (1962), which were inspired (like [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]]) by the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], specificaly Claudius. He resumed writing again in the 1960s, mainly at [[Frederik Pohl]]'s invitation.  His later novels included fixups such as ''[[The Beast (short story)|The Beast]]'' (aka ''[[Moonbeast]]'') (1963), ''[[Rogue Ship]]'' (1965), ''[[Quest for the Future]]'' (1970) and ''[[Supermind]]'' (1977); expanded short stories (''[[The Darkness on Diamondia]]'' (1972), ''[[Future Glitter]]'' (aka ''[[Tyranopolis]]'') (1973); original novels such as ''[[Children of Tomorrow]]'' (1970), ''[[The Battle of Forever]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Anarchistic Colossus]]'' (1977); plus sequels to his classic works, many of which were promised, but only one of which appeared, ''[[Null-A Three]]'' (1984; originally published in French).  Several later books were original in Europe, and at least one novel has only ever appeared in Italian, no English version yet published.
On January 26, 2000, van Vogt died in Los Angeles, USA from [[Alzheimer's disease]], and was survived by his second wife, the former Lydia Bereginsky.

==Critical reception==
Critical opinion about the quality of van Vogt's work has been sharply divided.

An early and articulate critic was the noted author [[Damon Knight]]. In a chapter-long essay reprinted in ''[[In Search of Wonder]],''&lt;ref name=DK/&gt; entitled &quot;Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt&quot;, Knight famously remarked that van Vogt &quot;is no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter.&quot; Knight described ''The World of Null-A'' as &quot;one of the worst allegedly-adult science fiction stories ever published.&quot; About van Vogt's writing in general, Knight said:

{{quote|In general van Vogt seems to me to fail consistently as a writer in these elementary ways: 1. His plots do not bear examination. 2. His choice of words and his sentence-structure are fumbling and insensitive. 3. He is unable either to visualize a scene or to make a character seem real.}}

About ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' Knight wrote:
{{quote|If you can only throw your reasoning powers out of gear - something many van Vogt fans find easy to do - you'll enjoy this one.}}

Knight also expressed misgivings about van Vogt's politics, noting that his stories almost invariably present [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchism]] in a favorable light.

On the other hand, when science fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]] was asked &lt;ref name=vertex&gt;Vertex, Vol. 1, no. 6, February 1974, available on-line http://www.philipkdick.com/media_vertex.html&lt;/ref&gt; which science fiction writers had influenced his work the most, he replied:

{{quote|I started reading sf when I was about twelve and I read all I could, so any author who was writing about that time, I read. But there's no doubt who got me off originally and that was A.E. van Vogt. There was in van Vogt's writing a mysterious quality, and this was especially true in [[The World of Null-A|The World of Null A]]. All the parts of that book did not add up; all the ingredients did not make a coherency. Now some people are put off by that. They think that's sloppy and wrong, but the thing that fascinated me so much was that this resembled reality more than anybody else's writing inside or outside science fiction.}}

Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knight’s criticisms:

{{quote|Damon feels that it's bad artistry when you build those funky universes where people fall through the floor. It's like he's viewing a story the way a building inspector would when he's building your house. But reality really is a mess, and yet it's exciting. The basic thing is, how frightened are you of chaos? And how happy are you with order? Van Vogt influenced me so much because he made me appreciate a mysterious chaotic quality in the universe which is not to be feared.}}

In a review of ''Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt'', science fiction writer [[Paul Di Filippo]] said:
{{quote|Van Vogt knew precisely what he was doing in all areas of his fiction writing. There's hardly a wasted word in his stories… His plots are marvels of interlocking pieces, often ending in real surprises and shocks, genuine paradigm shifts, which are among the hardest conceptions to depict. And the intellectual material of his fictions, the conceits and tossed-off observations on culture and human and alien behavior, reflect a probing mind…Each tale contains a new angle, a unique slant, that makes it stand out.&lt;ref&gt;DiFilippo, Paul: [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/books2.html &quot;Off The Shelf&quot;],{{dead link|date=August 2010}}Retrieved 2003-1-19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The [[John W. Campbell]] Letters'', Campbell says, &quot;The son-of-a-gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph, ties a knot around you, and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafter{{mdash}}including the ultimate last one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HLDrake&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Drake| first = Harold L. | title = The Null-A Worlds of A.E. van Vogt | publisher = C.

[[Harlan Ellison]] (who began reading van Vogt as a teenager&lt;ref name=&quot;harlan&quot;&gt;Ellison, Harlan [http://www.sfrevu.com/ISSUES/2000/ARTICLES/20000128-03.htm “Van is Here, But Van is Gone”] Retrieved 2001-08-31 “Van is still with us, as I write this, in June of 1999, slightly less than fifty years since I first encountered van Vogt prose in a January 1950 issue of ‘’Startling Stories’’,…”&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, &quot;Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HLDrake&quot; /&gt;

Writing in 1984 David Hartwell said:&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, David (1984) “Age of Wonders: Exploring the Worlds of Science Fiction”, New York, Walker, Page 131-132. ISBN 978-0-89366-163-2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|No one has taken van Vogt seriously as a writer for a long time. Yet he has been read and ''still'' is. What no one seems to have noticed is that van Vogt, more than any other single SF writer, is the conduit through which the energy of [[Gernsback]]ian, primitive wonder stories have been transmitted through the [[John W. Campbell|Campbellian]] age, when earlier styles of SF were otherwise rejected, and on into SF of the present.}}

The literary critic [[Leslie A. Fiedler]] said something similar:&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, Leslie A. (1983) “The Criticism of Science Fiction”, ''Coordinates: Placing Science Fiction and Fantasy, ed. George E. Slusser, Eric S. Rabkin, and Robert Scholes'' (Carbondale Southern Illinoois University Press, page 10-11. ISBN 978-0-8093-1105-7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Van Vogt is a test case, …since an apology for or analysis of science fiction which fails to come to terms with his appeal and major importance, defends of defines the genre by falsifying it.}}

The American literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]] says of van Vogt:

{{quote|…that van Vogt's work clearly prepares the way for that of the greatest of all Science Fiction writers, Philip K. Dick, whose extraordinary novels and stories are inconceivable without the opening onto that play of unconscious materials and fantasy dynamics released by van Vogt, and very different from the more hard-science aesthetic ideologies of his contemporaries (from Campbell to Heinlein).&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric. 'The Space of Science Fiction: Narrative in Van Vogt' in ''Archaeologies of the Future. The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions'' (New York:Verso, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|315}}}}

Nevertheless, van Vogt still has his critics. For example [[Darrell Schweitzer]] writing to the New York Review of Science Fiction in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Darrell (1999) “Letters of Comment”, ''New York Review of Science Fiction'', May 1999, Number 129, Vol. 11, No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; quoted a passage from the original van Vogt novelette “The Mixed Men”, which he was then reading, and remarked:

{{quote|This is the realism, and logic, of a small boy playing with toy soldiers in a sandbox. I’m tougher than you. I’ve got a ''billion'' spaceships! They’re brand-new. They only took 800 years to develop.

And this is a story in which most of the cast either have two brains or are really robots…and even the emotions of the human characters are programmed or deprogrammed as part of plots within counterplots. Next to this, Doc Smith was an icy realist. There is ''no'' intersection with adult reality at any point, for all van Vogt was able to write was that small boy’s sandbox game with an adult level of intensity. This is, I think, the secret of van Vogt’s bizarre fascination, as awful as his actual writing might be, and why he appealed so strongly to Philip K. Dick, who managed to put more adult characters and emotions into equally crazy situations. It’s ultimately very strange to find this sort of writing so prominently sponsored by supposedly rational and scientifically minded John W. Campbell, when it seems to contravene everything the Golden Age stood for.}}

==Recognition==
In 1946, van Vogt and his first wife, [[Edna Mayne Hull]], were co-Guests of Honor at the fourth [[World Science Fiction Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Kirk H. | last=Beetz | year=1996 | title=Beacham's Encyclopedia of Popular Fiction | publisher=Beacham Publishing | isbn=978-0-933833-38-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, van Vogt received a &quot;Casper Award&quot; (precursor to the Canadian [[Aurora Award]]s) for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Mullin | first=Dennis | date=October 27, 2007 | url=http://www.sentex.net/~dmullin/aurora/hist_dat.html | title=Prix AURORA Awards | publisher=Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association | accessdate=2008-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he was awarded the [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award]] by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA). There was controversy over how late in van Vogt’s lifetime the SFWA left it to bestow their highest award. Writing an obituary of van Vogt a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction remarked:

{{quote|There was no doubt that van Vogt should have received this honor much earlier—the injustice of him being overlooked, at least in part because of damnable SFWA politics, had so incensed [[Harlan Ellison]], a man with an impeccable moral compass, that he'd lobbied hard on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] and elsewhere on van Vogt's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J. Sawyer|Sawyer, Robert J.]] [http://www.sfwriter.com/vanvogt.htm “Remembering A. E. van Vogt “]. Retrieved 2010-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is generally held that the “damnable SFWA politics” relates to Damon Knight, the founder of the SFWA, who abhorred van Vogt’s style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hartwell|Hartwell, David]]: “The Way We Were: A. E. van Vogt, 1912-2000”, page 24, [[The New York Review of Science Fiction|''New York Review of Science Fiction'']], March 2000, Number 139, Vol. 12, No.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Harlan Ellison writing in 1999 the introduction&lt;ref name=&quot;harlan&quot; /&gt; to ''Futures Past: The Best Short Fiction of A.E. van Vogt'' was more explicit:

{{quote|
…at least I was able to make enough noise to get Van the Science Fiction Writers of America Grand Master Award, which was presented to him in full ceremony during one of the last moments when he was cogent and clearheaded enough to understand that finally, at last, dragged kicking and screaming to honor him, the generation that learned from what he did and what he had created had, at last, 'fessed up to his importance.

…were the same ones who assured me that Van would never get the Grand Master until Damon Knight had gotten it first, because Damon had loathed Van's work and had, in fact written the essay that ridiculed Van and held him up to opprobrium for decades thereafter, and Damon having founded SFWA it would be an affront to him if Van got it first. Well, I don't know if that's true or not, though it is was common coin in the field for years; but Damon got the Grand Master award in 1994. And Van got it in 1995. As they say during sweeps week on television: coincidence or conspiracy?
}}

In 1996, van Vogt was recognized on two occasions: the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] presented him with a Special Award ''for six decades of golden age science fiction'', and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame included him among its initial four inductees.

The works of van Vogt were translated into French by the surrealist [[Boris Vian]] (''The World of Null-A'' as ''Le Monde des Å'' in 1958), and van Vogt’s works were “viewed as great literature of the surrealist school”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Watson (author)|Watson, Ian]] (1999) “Science Fiction, Surrealism, and Shamanism”, page 9,

[[New York Review of Science Fiction]], June 1999, Number 130, Vol. 11, No. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable quotes==
Concerning [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s death, van Vogt commented: {{quote|Sturgeon had accepted the idea of dying. I thought: 'Well, I presume that when my time comes, it will also happen to me.' Because, we recognize that there is an end to human life. Now, it is my intention to postpone this moment as long as possible. But, I have only modern science to help me and they're not that busy…&lt;ref name=&quot;HLDrake&quot; /&gt;}}

'''Anna Sergeyevna Kournikova''' ({{lang-ru|{{audio|help=no|Anna_kournikova.ogg|Анна Сергеевна Ку́рникова}}}}; born 7 June 1981) is a [[Russians|Russian]] professional tennis player who now is a [[Russian-American]] citizen. Her celebrity status made her one of the best known tennis players worldwide. At the peak of her fame, fans looking for images of Kournikova made her name  one of the most common search strings on the Internet search engine [[Google]].&lt;ref name=2001EOY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist2001.html|title=2001 Year-End Google Zeitgeist: Search patterns, trends, and surprises|accessdate=8 July 2009|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2002EOY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist2002.html|title=2002 Year-End Google Zeitgeist: Search patterns, trends, and surprises|accessdate=8 July 2009|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2003EOY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/zeitgeist2003.html|title=2003 Year-End Google Zeitgeist: Search patterns, trends, and surprises|accessdate=9 July 2009|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although reaching No. 8 in the world in 2000, she never won a WTA Title in singles. Kournikova's specialty has been doubles, where she has at times been the [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] player.

== Early life ==
Anna Kournikova was born in Moscow, Soviet Union, on June 7, 1981. Her father, Sergei Kournikov, was 20 at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.sportsmates.com/index.php?cmd=view_gallery&amp;gal_id=380&amp;image_id=5975&amp;page=1&amp;club_id=2461 Sportsmates: About Anna Kournikova]&lt;/ref&gt; Sergei, a former [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] champion, had earned a Ph.D. and was a professor at the University of Physical Culture and Sport in Moscow. As of 2001, he was still a part-time martial arts instructor there.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt; Her mother Alla, who was 18 when Kournikova was born, had been a 400-meter runner.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt;

Sergei Kournikov has said, &quot;We were young and we liked the clean, physical life, so Anna was in a good environment for sport from the beginning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt; The family name is spelled in Russian without an &quot;o&quot;, so a direct transliteration would be &quot;Kurnikov&quot;, and it is sometimes written that way. But it is pronounced &quot;Kournikov&quot;, so the family chose that as their English spelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt;

Kournikova received her first [[tennis]] [[racquet]] as a [[New Year]] gift in 1986 at age 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt; Describing her early regimen, she said, &quot;I played two times a week from age five. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I was going to play professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd spend the rest of the day there just having fun with the kids.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt; In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the  [[Spartak Tennis Club]], coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;kournikova.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.kournikova.com/about/bio Official Biography of Anna Kournikova]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world.

Kournikova's two [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] doubles titles came in 1999 and 2002, both at the [[Australian Open]] in the Women's Doubles event with partner [[Martina Hingis]]. Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] and at Wimbledon, and reaching the No.1 ranking in doubles in the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour rankings.

== Playing style ==
As a player, Kournikova was noted for her footspeed and aggressive baseline play, and excellent angles and dropshots; however, her relatively flat, high-risk groundstrokes tended to produce frequent errors, and her serve was sometimes unreliable in singles.

Kournikova plays right-handed with a two-handed [[backhand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WTA&quot;/&gt;  She is a great player at the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DD1339F934A1575BC0A960958260 | title = Substance Behind Those Shades  | accessdate = 7 July 2008 | date = 27 August 1996| author = Selena Roberts | work = New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She can hit forceful groundstrokes and also [[drop shot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E0DF153BF932A15754C0A961958260 | work = New York Times | accessdate = 7 July 2008 | date = 21 July 1997 | author = Ron Dicker | title = Rubin Defeats Kournikova in Exhibition Final }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her playing style fits the profile for a doubles player, and is complemented by her height.&lt;ref name=&quot;sweetannakournikova.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.sweetannakournikova.com/bio.php Sweet Anna Kournikova – Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; She has been compared to such doubles specialists as [[Pam Shriver]] and [[Peter Fleming (tennis player)|Peter Fleming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sweetannakournikova.com&quot;/&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Anna Kournikova at WTT press conference 2010-07.jpg|thumb|Kournikova at a WTT press conference in July 2010]]
Kournikova was in a relationship with fellow Russian, [[Pavel Bure]], an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[ice hockey]] player. The two met in 1999 when Kournikova was still linked to Bure's former Russian teammate [[Sergei Fedorov]].&lt;ref name=arbat&gt;{{cite news |title=People: Courtney Love, Scissor Sisters, Antonio Moral |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/arts/11iht-peepsat.html |accessdate=2009-07-12 |date=2005-02-11 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after a reporter took a photo of them together in a [[Florida]] restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him.  As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement.  Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kournikova and Bure wedding may be off |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/kournikova-and-bure-wedding-may-be-off-720494.html |accessdate=2009-06-24 |date=2000-04-06 |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow.&lt;ref name=arbat/&gt;  They were soon divorced, however.

Kournikova started dating [[pop music|pop star]] [[Enrique Iglesias]] in late 2001 (she appeared in his video, &quot;Escape&quot;), and rumors that the couple had secretly married circulated in 2003 and again in 2005. Kournikova herself has consistently refused to directly confirm or deny the status of her personal relationships. But in May 2007, [[Enrique Iglesias]] was (mistakenly, as he would clarify later) quoted in the ''[[New York Sun]]'' that he had no intention of marrying Kournikova and settling down because they had split up. The singer would later deny these rumors of &quot;divorce&quot; or simply separation. In June 2008, Iglesias told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' that he had married Kournikova the previous year and that they are currently separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a104379/iglesias-anna-and-i-were-married.html | title=Iglesias: 'Anna and I were married'| publisher=Digital Spy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Graham Norton]] in 2010, Kournikova confirmed that she and Iglesias have been together for over eight years but have no plans to marry in the near future.

Kournikova has a younger brother, Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/content/sports/2009/01/19/allan0120.html | title=Anna Kornikova's brother, Allan, 4, excels at three sports| publisher=Palm Beach Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an American citizen in late 2009.

Most of Kournikova's fame has come from the publicity surrounding her looks and her personal life.  During Kournikova's debut at the 1996 U.S. Open at the age of 15, the world noticed her beauty, and soon pictures of her appeared in numerous magazines worldwide.

In 2000, Kournikova became the new face for [[Berlei]]'s shock absorber sports bras, and appeared in the  &quot;only the ball should bounce&quot; billboard campaign.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Photographs of her scantily-clad form have appeared in various [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]], including one in the much-publicized 2004 ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'',{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} where she posed in bikinis and swimsuits, and in other  men's publications such as ''[[FHM]]''{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Kournikova was named one of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'s'' 50 Most Beautiful People in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2003,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and was voted &quot;hottest female athlete&quot; and &quot;hottest couple&quot; (with Iglesias) on [[ESPN.com]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2002 she also placed first in ''[[FHM]]'s 100 Sexiest Women in the World'' in U.S. and UK editions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} By contrast, [[ESPN]]—citing the degree of hype as compared to actual accomplishments as a singles player—ranked Kournikova 18th in its &quot;25 Biggest Sports Flops of the Past 25 Years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/25biggestflops | title=Biggest Sports Flop | publisher=ESPN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kournikova was also ranked #1 in the ESPN Classic series &quot;Who's number 1?&quot; when the series featured sport's most overrated athletes.

She continued to be the most searched athlete on the Internet through 2008 even though she had retired from the professional tennis circuit years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:NUSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10E7B50799428D80&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Web Users Have Spoken: Paris Hilton Is the Most-Searched Term of 2005 - Lycos Announces the Most Popular Internet Search Terms of 2005 and the Ones to Watch in 2006 Eminem, Web's Most Wanted Man; The Simpsons, Top TV Show; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Top Movie; Green Day, Top Band; Hurricane Katrina, Most- Searched News Event|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=12 December 2005|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:NUSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=116001EDD2BE89C8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Web Users Have Spoken: Poker is the Most-Searched Term of 2006...LYCOS Announces the Most Popular Internet Search Terms of 2006 and the Ones to Watch in 2007 - Iran Nuclear Program, Most-Searched News Event; Perez Hilton, Most-Searched Blog Site Clay Aiken, Web's Most Wanted Man; Pamela Anderson, Most-Searched Woman &quot;American Idol&quot;, Top TV Show; &quot;High School Musical&quot;, Top Movie; Green Day, Top Band |accessdate=22 July 2009|date=13 December 2006|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:NUSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11D751AC8FF92838&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Lycos Announces the Most Popular Internet Search Terms of 2007 and the Ones to Watch in 2008 - POKER Trumps all Other Search Topics to Top Lycos Year-End List for 2nd Consecutive Year SADDAM HUSSEIN EXECUTION, Most-Searched News Event of 2007; &quot;DANCING WITH THE STARS&quot;, Top TV Show; &quot;TRANSFORMERS&quot;, Top Film BRITNEY SPEARS, Most-Searched Woman, CLAY AIKEN Web's Most Wanted Man TMZ, Most Popular Blog Site|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=10 December 2007|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ZFBS&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12527D6CD9CB7460&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Wireless News: Lycos Reveals Its Most Popular Internet Search Terms of 2008|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Wireless News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After slipping from first to sixth among athletes in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearinreview.yahoo.com/2009/blog/22|title=Tiger Woods, Most Searched Athlete|accessdate=2010-12-09|date=2009-12-24|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; she moved back up to third place among athletes in terms of search popularity in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsmarketingblog.net/2010/12/01/yahoo-top-10-lists/|title=Yahoo Top 10 Lists|accessdate=2010-12-09|date=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna's popularity has extended into [[Texas Hold 'em]] lingo, where the [[hole card]]s [[Ace]]–[[King (playing card)|King]] (unsuited) are sometimes referred to as an &quot;Anna Kournikova&quot;, a term introduced by the poker commentator Vince van Patton during a WPT tournament because &quot;it looks great but never wins&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasholdem-poker.com/hand_nicknames|title=Poker nicknames}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:FINB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1193F162D085F718&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=FT Weekend Magazine – Non-fiction: Stakes and chips Las Vegas and the internet have helped poker become the biggest game in town|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=19 May 2007|work=[[Financial Times]]|author=Aspden, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ASTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11A694A707377538&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=A little luck helps out|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=15 July 2007|work=[[Sunday Tasmanian]]|author=Martain, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Alfons Maria Jakob''' (2 July 1884, [[Aschaffenburg]]/[[Bavaria]]&amp;ndash;17 October 1931, [[Hamburg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] with important contributions on [[neuropathology]].

Alfons Maria Jakob was the son of a shopkeeper. He studied [[medicine]] in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], and [[Strasbourg]], where obtained his doctorate in 1908. In 1909 he commenced clinical work under the [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] and did laboratory work with [[Franz Nissl]] and [[Alois Alzheimer]] in [[Munich]].

In 1911 he went to [[Hamburg]] to work with [[Theodor Kaes]] and became head of the laboratory of [[anatomical pathology]] at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as [[prosector]]. After serving in the [[Germany|German]] army in [[World War I]], he returned to Hamburg and climbed the academic ladder. He was habilitated in [[neurology]] in 1919 and in 1924 became professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made notable contributions to knowledge on [[concussion]] and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of [[neuropathology]].

Jakob published five monographs and more than 75 papers. His neuropathological studies contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He first recognised and described [[Alper's disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (the latter with [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]]). He accumulated immense experience in [[neurosyphilis]], having a 200-bedded ward devoted exclusively to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the [[United States]] and [[South America]] where he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of [[yellow fever]].

He suffered from chronic [[osteomyelitis]] for the last 7 years of his life. This eventually caused a retroperitoneal [[abscess]] and [[Paralysis|paralytic]] [[ileus]] from which he died following operation.

'''Agnosticism''' is the view that certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any [[deity]], but also other religious and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claims—is unknown or unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote=In the popular sense, an agnostic is someone who neither believes nor disbelieves in God, whereas an atheist disbelieves in God. In the strict sense, however, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist. In so far as one holds that our beliefs are rational only if they are sufficiently supported by human reason, the person who accepts the philosophical position of agnosticism will hold that neither the belief that God exists nor the belief that God does not exist is rational.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Agnosticism can be defined in various ways, and is sometimes used to indicate doubt or a [[Skepticism|skeptical]] approach to questions. In some senses, agnosticism is a stance about the similarities or differences between [[belief]] and [[knowledge]],{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;!--it was about differences first, then &quot;similarities or&quot; was added, the result sense has got vague--&gt; rather than about any specific claim or belief.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an English biologist, coined the word ''agnostic'' in 1869. However, earlier thinkers and written works have promoted agnostic points of view. They include [[Protagoras]], a 5th-century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] Greek philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/protagor.htm |title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Protagoras (c. 490 - c. 420 BCE) |accessdate=2008-10-06 |quote=While the pious might wish to look to the gods to provide absolute moral guidance in the relativistic universe of the Sophistic Enlightenment, that certainty also was cast into doubt by philosophic and sophistic thinkers, who pointed out the absurdity and immorality of the conventional epic accounts of the gods.

==Defining agnosticism==
[[Demographic]] research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non-religious respondents so agnostics end up in the same category as [[atheism|atheists]] and/or other [[irreligion|non-religious]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Nonreligious |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources use ''agnostic'' in the sense of ''noncommittal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Agnostics |title=Agnostics - definition of Agnostics by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnosticism often overlaps with other belief systems. [[Agnostic theism|Agnostic theists]] identify themselves both as agnostics and as followers of particular religions, viewing agnosticism as a framework for thinking about the nature of belief and their relation to revealed truths. Some nonreligious people, such as author [[Philip Pullman]], identify as both agnostic and atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surefish.co.uk/culture/features/pullman_interview.htm |title=Interview with Philip Pullman |publisher=surefish.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] defined the term:

{{quote|Agnosticism is not a creed but a method, the essence of which lies in the vigorous application of a single principle... Positively the principle may be expressed as in matters of intellect, do not pretend conclusions are certain that are not demonstrated or demonstrable.&lt;ref name = &quot;jvenfuc&quot; /&gt;}}

===Etymology===
''Agnostic'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀ- a-, without + [[wikt:γνῶσις|γνῶσις]] gnōsis, knowledge) was used by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876&lt;ref name = &quot;jvenfuc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/huxley.htm |title=Agnosticism &amp; Thomas Henry Huxley |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his philosophy which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge. Early [[Christian]] church leaders used the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) to describe &quot;spiritual knowledge.&quot; Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of [[Gnosticism]] in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.&lt;ref name = &quot;nknxjx&quot;&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary, 2000'', under ''agnostic''&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of [[Skepticism|skeptical]], evidence-based inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=97DaE6BzKTsC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Aphorisms and Reflections |first=Henrietta A. last=Huxley|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |date=2004 (reprint) |pages=41–42|isbn=9781419107306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean &quot;not knowable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Additions Series, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In technical and marketing literature, ''agnostic'' often has a meaning close to &quot;independent&quot;—for example, &quot;platform agnostic&quot; or &quot;hardware agnostic.&quot;

===Qualifying agnosticism===
[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David, &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1748)&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (i.e. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] such as &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot; or &quot;all triangles have three corners&quot;). All rational statements that assert a factual claim about the universe that begin &quot;I believe that ....&quot; are simply shorthand for, &quot;Based on my knowledge, understanding, and interpretation of the prevailing evidence, I tentatively believe that....&quot; For instance, when one says, &quot;I believe that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] shot [[John F. Kennedy]],&quot; one is not asserting an absolute truth but a tentative belief based on interpretation of the assembled evidence. Even though one may set an alarm clock prior to the following day, believing that waking up will be possible, that belief is tentative, tempered by a small but finite degree of doubt (the alarm might break, or one might die before the alarm goes off).

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls Partial Agnosticism, specifically those systems that &quot;do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the Unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Agnosticism, II., |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01215c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the ability of human reason to know God.  The Council of the Vatican, relying on biblical [[scripture]], declares that &quot;God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation&quot; (Const. De Fide, II, De Rev.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Agnosticism, VIII. |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01215c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of agnosticism===
Agnosticism can be subdivided into several categories. Recently suggested variations include:
;[[Agnostic atheism]]: Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not have belief in the existence of any deity, and agnostic because they do not claim to know that a deity does not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtheismVsAgnosticism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/atheism.htm|title=Atheism vs. Agnosticism: What's the Difference? Are they Alternatives to Each Other?|accessdate=2006-09-24|last=Cline|first=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Agnostic theism]]: The view of those who do not claim to ''know'' of the existence of any deity, but still ''believe'' in such an existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtheismVsAgnosticism&quot;/&gt;
;[[Apatheism|Apathetic or Pragmatic agnosticism]]: The view that there is no proof of either the existence or nonexistence of any deity, but since any deity that may exist appears unconcerned for the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants, the question is largely academic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008|reason=I think it's the agnostic who could also become apathetic to the question, since answer could makes little difference to one's life}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/apatheism.htm|title=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance: Apatheism: «Does God exist? I don't know &amp; I don't really care»|accessdate=2010-10-01|author=B.A. Loftus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Ignosticism]]: The view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the [[theological noncognitivism|noncognitivist]] view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Ayer|A.J. Ayer]], [[Theodore Drange]], and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept &quot;a deity exists&quot; as a meaningful proposition which can be argued for or against. An ignostic cannot even say whether he/she is a theist or a nontheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html|last=Drange |first=Theodore|year=1998|title=Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism|accessdate=2010-05-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Failed verification|date=November 2008|1&gt;&quot;ignostic&quot; does not appear on that page, 2&gt;he says NOTHING of the sort re &quot;NONTHEISM&quot;}}
;[[Strong agnosticism]] (also called &quot;hard,&quot; &quot;closed,&quot; &quot;strict,&quot; or &quot;permanent agnosticism&quot;): The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities, and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, &quot;I cannot know whether a deity exists or not, and neither can you.&quot;
;[[Weak agnosticism]] (also called &quot;soft,&quot; &quot;open,&quot; &quot;empirical,&quot; or &quot;temporal agnosticism&quot;): The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until/if any evidence is available. A weak agnostic would say, &quot;I don't know whether any deities exist or not, but maybe one day, when there is evidence, we can find something out.&quot;

==History==

Since Huxley first used the term, several writers have defended agnosticism as a philosophical viewpoint. A number of earlier thinkers and writings have explored agnostic thought.

===In Greek philosophy===
Agnostic thought, in the form of [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], emerged as a formal philosophical position in [[ancient Greece]]. Its proponents included [[Protagoras]], [[Pyrrho]], and [[Carneades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gareth Southwell |url=http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/tok/scepticism8.htm |title=Scepticism - History of Scepticism |publisher=Philosophyonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such thinkers rejected the idea that certainty was possible.

===Hume, Kant, and Kierkegaard===
Many philosophers (following the examples of [[Aristotle]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Aquinas]], and [[Descartes]]) presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God. The skeptical empiricism of [[David Hume]], the [[antinomy|antinomies]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and the existential philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.&lt;ref name=RoweRoutledge-online&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1844 book, ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', Kierkegaard writes:

{{quote|Let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Thomas Henry Huxley===
{{See also|Thomas Henry Huxley}}[[File:ThomasHenryHuxley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]]]

Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by Huxley to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the &quot;unconditioned&quot; (Hamilton) and the &quot;unknowable&quot; ([[Herbert Spencer]]). It is important, therefore, to discover Huxley's own views on the matter. Though Huxley began to use the term &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to Charles Kingsley, Huxley discussed his views extensively:

{{quote|I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter...

It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions...

That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.}}

And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:

{{quote|I have never had the least sympathy with the [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] reasons against [[orthodoxy]], and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and [[infidel]] school. Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the [[Christian]] would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.}}

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Collected Essays| first=Thomas| last=Huxley| isbn= 1-85506-922-9| pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain &quot;gnosis,&quot;–had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble.

So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of &quot;agnostic.&quot; It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the &quot;gnostic&quot; of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant. To my great satisfaction the term took.}}

Huxley's agnosticism is believed to be a natural consequence of the intellectual and philosophical conditions of the 1860s, when clerical intolerance was trying to suppress scientific discoveries which appeared to clash with a literal reading of the [[Book of Genesis]] and other established [[Jewish]] and [[Christian Theology|Christian]] doctrines. Agnosticism should not, however, be confused with [[natural theology]], [[deism]], [[pantheism]], or other science positive forms of [[theism]].

By way of clarification, Huxley states, &quot;In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable&quot; (Huxley, ''Agnosticism'', 1889). Although [[A. W. Momerie]] has noted that this is nothing but a definition of [[honesty]], Huxley's usual definition goes beyond mere honesty to insist that these metaphysical issues are fundamentally unknowable.

===Robert G. Ingersoll===
{{See also|Robert G. Ingersoll}}
[[File:RobertGIngersoll.jpg|thumb|[[Robert G. Ingersoll]]]]
Robert G. Ingersoll, an [[Illinois]] lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th century America, has been referred to as the &quot;Great Agnostic.&quot;

In an 1896 lecture titled ''Why I Am An Agnostic'', Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:

{{quote|Is there a supernatural power—an arbitrary mind—an enthroned God—a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world—to which all causes bow? I do not deny. I do not know—but I do not believe. I believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man.

I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects.

Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be.}}

In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:

{{quote|We can be as honest as we are ignorant. If we are, when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known, we must say that we do not know.}}

===Bertrand Russell===
{{See also|Bertrand Russell}}
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bertrand Russell]]]]

[[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[pamphlet]], ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title, is considered a classic statement of agnosticism. The essay briefly lays out Russell’s objections to some of the [[arguments for the existence of God]] before discussing his moral objections to Christian teachings. He then calls upon his readers to &quot;stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world,&quot; with a &quot;fearless attitude and a free intelligence.&quot;

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:

{{quote|The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Russell| first= Bertrand| title=Collected Papers, Vol 10| page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:

{{quote|That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers, Vol. 10'', p.258&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance In The Face Of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:

{{quote|As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God.

On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the [[Homeric]] gods.}}

In his 1953 essay, ''What Is An Agnostic?'' Russell states:

{{quote|An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.}}

However, later in the essay, Russell says:

{{quote|I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence.}}

==Criticism==
Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as a limitation of the mind's capacity to know reality other than material objects. Some atheists also criticize the use of the term ''agnosticism'' as functionally indistinguishable from atheism.

===Religious criticism===
Many theistic thinkers repudiate the validity of agnosticism, or certain forms of agnosticism.  Religious scholars in the three [[Abrahamic religions]] affirm the possibility of knowledge, even of metaphysical realities such as God and the soul,&lt;ref&gt;Shed Muhammad Naquib Al-Attas, [http://www.pdcnet.org/pdf/jip1-Naquib%20al-Attas.pdf Journal of Islamic Philosophy], p 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; because human intelligence, they assert, has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element.  They affirm that “not being able to see or hold some specific thing does not necessarily negate its existence,” as in the case of [[gravity]], [[entropy]], or [[reason]] and [[thought]].

Religious scholars, such as Brown, Tacelli, and Kreeft, argue that agnosticism does not take into account the numerous evidence of his existence that God has placed in his creation.&lt;ref name=Islamrel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/641/| title=Religion of Islam: Agnosticism| author=Laurence B. Brown| year=2007 | accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; And for this, [[Peter Kreeft]] and Ronald Tacelli cite 20 arguments for God’s existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm Twenty Arguments for the Existence of God], from the ''Handbook of Christian Apologetics'' by Peter Kreeft and Fr. Ronald Tacelli, SJ, Intervarsity Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that agnosticism's demand for scientific evidence through laboratory testing is in effect asking God, the supreme being, to become man’s servant.&lt;ref name=JON&gt;{{cite book| title=Jesus of Nazareth| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Random House|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the question of God should be treated differently from other knowable objects in that &quot;this question regards not that which is below us, but that which is above us.&quot;&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt; Christian Philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] argued that, even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal’s Wager]]: the [[infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer “bet” to choose God.&lt;ref name=PKPW/&gt;

According to [[Joseph Ratzinger]], later [[Pope Benedict XVI]], agnosticism, more specifically strong agnosticism, is reasoning that limits and contradicts itself in claiming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]], but not religious or philosophical truths.&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TT/&gt;  He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for the dangerous pathologies of religion and science such as human and ecological disasters.&lt;ref name=YOJC&gt;{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite book| title=Truth and Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, [http://www.zenit.org/article-16955?l=english Address at the University of Regensburg 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; “Agnosticism,” said Ratzinger, “is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man [...] The knowledge of God has always existed.”&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;

According to some theistic scholars, agnosticism is impossible in actual practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (''etsi Deus non daretur''), or as if God did exist (''etsi Deus daretur'').&lt;ref name=SM/&gt;&lt;ref name=FF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.faithfacts.org/search-for-truth/questions-of-christians/why-cant-I-live-my-life-as-an-agnostic| title=Why can’t I live my life as an agnostic?| year=2007 | accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCC&gt;{{cite book| title=Christianity and the Crisis of Cultures| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger| isbn= 978-1-58617-142-1|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These scholars believe that each day in a person’s life is an unavoidable step towards death, and thus not to decide for or against God, whom they view as the all-encompassing foundation, [[purpose]], and [[meaning of life]], is to decide in favor of [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=PKPW&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/125081?eng=y| title=Habermas writes to Ratzinger and Ruini responds| author=Sandro Magister| year=2007 | accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atheist criticism===
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero we are willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. Since in practice it is not worth contrasting a zero probability with one that is nearly indistinguishable from zero, he prefers to categorize himself as a &quot;de facto atheist&quot;. He specifies his position by means of a scale of 1 to 7. On this scale, 1 indicates &quot;100 per cent probability of God.&quot; A person ranking at 7 on the scale would be a person who says &quot;I know there is no God...&quot; Dawkins places himself at 6 on the scale, which he characterizes as &quot;I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there&quot;, but leaning toward 7. About himself, Dawkins continues that &quot;I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; ''Temporary Agnostics in Practice'' (TAPs), and ''Permanent Agnostics in Principle'' (PAPs).  Dawkins considers temporary agnosticism an entirely reasonable position, but views permanent agnosticism as &quot;fence-sitting, intellectual cowardice.&quot;

{{Infobox argon}}

'''Argon''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|ɒ|n}}) is a [[chemical element]] represented by the symbol '''Ar'''. Argon has [[atomic number]] 18 and is the third element in group 18 of the [[periodic table]] ([[noble gas]]es). Argon is the third most common gas in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], at 0.93%, making it more common than [[carbon dioxide]]. Nearly all of this argon is [[radiogenic]] [[argon-40]] derived from the decay of [[potassium-40]] in the Earth's crust. In the universe, [[argon-36]] is by far the most common argon isotope, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar [[nucleosynthesis]] in supernovas.

The name &quot;argon&quot; is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word '''''αργον''''' meaning &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;the inactive one&quot;, a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete [[octet rule|octet]] (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its [[triple point]] temperature of 83.8058&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] is a defining fixed point in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]]. 

Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]]. Argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon gas also has uses in incandescent and fluorescent lighting, and other types of gas discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive [[Ion laser#Argon laser|blue-green gas laser]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Argon ice 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A small piece of rapidly melting argon ice.]]
Argon has approximately the same [[solubility]] in water as oxygen gas and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than [[nitrogen]] gas. Argon is colorless, odorless, and nontoxic as a solid, liquid, and gas. Argon is inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.

Although argon is a [[noble gas]], it has been found to have the capability of forming some compounds. For example, the creation of [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF), a marginally stable compound of argon with [[fluorine]] and [[hydrogen]], was reported by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles-harf&quot;&gt;

==Occurrence==
Argon constitutes 0.934% by volume and 1.28% by mass of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and air is the primary raw material used by industry to produce purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by [[fractionation]], most commonly by [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] [[fractional distillation]], a process that also produces purified [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[neon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of argon}}

The main [[isotope]]s of argon found on Earth are {{chem|40|Ar}} (99.6%), &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Ar (0.34%), and &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;Ar (0.06%). Naturally occurring {{chem|40|[[potassium|K]]}} with a [[half-life]] of 1.25{{e|9}} years, decays to stable {{chem|40|Ar}} (11.2%) by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]], and also to stable {{chem|40|Ca}} (88.8%) via [[beta decay]]. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] by the method of [[K-Ar dating]].&lt;ref name=iso&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Earth's atmosphere, {{chem|39|Ar}} is made by [[cosmic ray]] activity, primarily with {{chem|40|Ar}}. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through [[neutron capture]] by {{chem|39|K}} or [[alpha decay|alpha emission]] by [[calcium]]. &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Ar is created from the neutron [[spallation]] of {{chem|40|Ca}} as a result of subsurface [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosions]]. It has a half-life of 35 days.&lt;ref name=iso/&gt;

Argon is notable in that its isotopic composition varies greatly between different locations in the [[solar system]]. Where the major source of argon is the decay of [[potassium-40]] in rocks, Argon-40 will be the dominant isotope, as it is on earth. Argon produced directly by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], in contrast, is dominated by the [[alpha process]] nuclide, argon-36. Correspondingly, solar argon contains 84.6% argon-36 based on [[solar wind]] measurements.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Lodders |first=K.
 |year = 2008
 |title=The solar argon abundance
 |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]
 |volume=674 |pages=607

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominance of [[radiogenic]] argon-40 is responsible for the fact that the [[standard atomic weight]] of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element, [[potassium]]. This was puzzling at the time when argon was discovered, since [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] had placed the elements in his [[periodic table]] in order of atomic weight, although the inertness of argon implies that it must be placed before the reactive alkali metal potassium. [[Henry Moseley]] later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of [[atomic number]]. (See [[History of the periodic table]]).

The much greater [[Air#Composition|atmospheric abundance]] of argon relative to the other noble gases is also due to the presence of radiogenic argon-40. [[Primordial nuclide|Primordial]] argon-36 has an abundance of only 31.5 ppmv (= 9340 ppmv x 0.337%), comparable to that of neon (18.18 ppmv).

The [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] contains 1.6% of argon-40 and 5&amp;nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|ppm]] of argon-36. The [[Mariner program|Mariner]] space probe fly-by of the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1973 found that Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with 70% argon, believed to result from releases of the gas as a decay product from radioactive materials on the planet. In 2005, the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Huygens]]'' probe also discovered the presence of argon-40 on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Compounds==
{{See also|Van der Waals molecule|l1={{chem|H|2}}-Ar}}

Argon’s complete octet of [[electrons]] indicates full s and p subshells. This full outer energy level makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements. Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds; however, compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized. In August 2000, the first argon compounds were formed by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]]. By shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF) was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles-harf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Production==
===Industrial===
Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]] in a [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]] unit; a process that separates [[liquid nitrogen]], which boils at 77.3&amp;nbsp;K, from argon, which boils at 87.3&amp;nbsp;K and [[liquid oxygen]], which boils at 90.2&amp;nbsp;K. About 700,000 [[tonne]]s of argon are produced worldwide every year.&lt;ref&gt;

 |publisher=Environmentalchemistry.com
 |accessdate=2008-09-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In radioactive decays===
[[Isotopes of argon|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar]], the most abundant [[isotope]] of argon, is produced by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;[[potassium|K]] with a half-life of 1.25{{e|9}} years by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]]. Because of this, it is used in [[potassium-argon dating]] to determine the age of rocks.

==Applications==
[[Image:Argon.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Cylinders containing argon gas for use in extinguishing [[fire]] without damaging server equipment]]
There are several different reasons argon is used in particular applications:

*An [[inert]] gas is needed. In particular, argon is the cheapest alternative when [[nitrogen]] is not sufficiently inert.
*Low [[thermal conductivity]] is required.
*The electronic properties (ionization and/or the emission spectrum) are necessary.

Other [[noble gas]]es would probably work as well in most of these applications, but argon is by far the cheapest. Argon is inexpensive since it is a byproduct of the production of [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid nitrogen]] from a [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]] unit, both of which are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except [[helium]]) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful since it has the highest concentration in the atmosphere. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.

===Industrial processes===
Argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes, where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.

For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in various types of [[metal inert gas welding]] such as [[tungsten inert gas welding]], as well as in the processing of [[titanium]] and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]].

{{See also|shielding gas}}
Argon is an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] in the poultry industry, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon's relatively high density causes it to remain close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing fires where damage to equipment is to be avoided.

===Scientific research===

Argon is used, primarily in liquid form, as the target for direct [[dark matter]] searches. The interaction of a hypothetical [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]] particle with the Argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is then detected by [[photomultiplier tubes]]. Two-phase detectors, also use Argon gas to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP-nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, Argon has a high scintillation lightyield (~ 51 photons / keV &lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and is relatively easy to purify. Compared to [[Xenon]], Argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. On the other hand, its intrinsic gamma-ray background is larger due to &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar contamination, unless one uses underground Argon sources with a low level of radioactivity. Dark matter detectors currently operating with liquid Argon include WArP, [[ArDM]], microCLEAN and DEAP-I.

===Preservative===
[[File:CsCrystals.JPG|thumb|A sample of [[caesium]] is packed under argon to avoid reactions with air]]
Argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents. Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions which degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. Bottles of high-purity chemicals and certain pharmaceutical products are available in sealed bottles or ampoules packed in argon. In wine making, argon is used to top-off barrels to avoid the aerial oxidation of [[ethanol]] to [[acetic acid]] during the aging process.

Argon is also available in [[aerosol]]-type cans, which may be used to preserve compounds such as [[varnish]], [[polyurethane]], paint, etc. for storage after opening.&lt;ref&gt;Zawalick, Steven Scott &quot;Method for preserving an oxygen sensitive liquid product&quot; {{US patent|6629402}} Issue date: October 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, the American [[National Archives]] stores important national documents such as the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] within argon-filled cases to retard their degradation. Using argon reduces gas leakage, compared with the helium used in the preceding five decades.&lt;ref&gt;

===Laboratory equipment===
[[Image:Glovebox.jpg|thumb|[[Glovebox]]es are often filled with argon, which recirculates over scrubbers to maintain an [[oxygen]]- and moisture-free atmosphere]]
{{See also|Air-free technique}}

Argon may be used as the [[inert gas]] within [[Schlenk line]]s and [[glovebox]]es. The use of argon over comparatively less expensive nitrogen is preferred where nitrogen may react with the experimental reagents or apparatus.

Argon may be used as the carrier gas in [[gas chromatography]] and in [[electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]]; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in [[Inductively coupled plasma|ICP]] [[spectroscopy]]. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Argon ions are also used for sputtering in microelectronics.

===Medical use===
[[Cryosurgery]] procedures such as [[cryoablation]] use liquefied argon to destroy [[cancer]] cells. In surgery it is used in a procedure called &quot;argon enhanced coagulation&quot; which is a form of argon plasma beam [[electrosurgery]]. The procedure carries a risk of producing [[gas embolism]] in the patient and has resulted in the death of one person via this type of accident.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Incandescent light]]s are filled with argon, to preserve the [[electrical filament|filaments]] at high temperature from oxidation. It is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in [[plasma globe]]s and [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimetry]] in experimental [[particle physics]]. [[Gas-discharge lamp]]s filled with argon provide blue light. Argon is also used for the creation of blue and green laser light.

Argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years, has been used for a number of applications, primarily [[ice core]] and [[ground water]] dating. Also, [[potassium-argon dating]] is used in dating [[igneous rock]]s.

==Safety==
Although argon is non-toxic, it does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen and is thus an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]]. Argon is 25% more [[density|dense]] than air and is considered highly dangerous in closed areas. It is also difficult to detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. In confined spaces, it is known to result in death due to [[asphyxia]]tion. A 1994 incident in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon filled section of oil pipe under construction in [[Alaska]] highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces, and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!-- THIS ARTICLE WAS STARTED IN AND IS KEPT IN BRITISH SPELLING --&gt;
'''Arsenic''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ɑr|s|ən|ɪ|k}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''As''', [[atomic number]] 33 and [[relative atomic mass]] 74.92. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, mainly combined with sulfur and metals, and also naturally in the native (elemental) state. It was first documented by [[Albertus Magnus]] in 1250.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBlocks451-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5|pages=43,513,529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenic is a [[metalloid]]. It can exist in various [[allotropy|allotropes]], although only the grey form has important use in industry. The main use of metallic arsenic is for strengthening alloys of copper and especially lead (for example, in automotive batteries). Arsenic is a common n-type [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]] electronic devices, and the [[optoelectronic]] compound [[gallium arsenide]] is the most common semiconductor in use after doped silicon.

A few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites, and are arsenic-tolerant. However, arsenic is notoriously poisonous to multicellular life, due to the interaction of arsenic ions with protein [[thiol]]s. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of [[pesticide]]s (treated wood products), [[herbicide]]s and [[insecticide]]s. These applications are declining, however, as many of these compounds are in the process of being banned.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Sabina C. Grund, Kunibert Hanusch, Hans Uwe Wolf | title = Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a03_113.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[arsenic poisoning]] as a result of the natural occurrence of arsenic compounds in drinking water remains a problem for many parts of the world including the United States.

==Characteristics==
===Physical characteristics===
The most common allotrope of arsenic is ''grey arsenic''. It adopts a layered structure, a ruffled analogue of [[graphite]], consisting of many interlocked six-membered rings. Each atom is bound to three other atoms in the layer and is coordinated by each 3 arsenic atoms in the upper and lower layer. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;/&gt; It is a [[semiconductor]] and a solid ([[mohs scale]] = 3.5).
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right&quot;&gt;
[[Image:White phosphrous molecule.jpg|left|thumb|100px| Structure of yellow arsenic As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and white [[phosphorus]] P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] &lt;/div&gt;
Like phosphorus, arsenic exhibits [[allotropy]], although only the gray allotrope is important under normal conditions. The three most common allotropes are ''metallic grey'', ''yellow'' and ''black arsenic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Chemistry of Arsenic, Antimony and Bismuth|first = Nicholas C|last = Norman|publisher = Springer|year = 1998|isbn = 9780751403893|url = http://books.google.com/?id=vVhpurkfeN4C|pages = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Yellow arsenic'' ({{chem|As|4}}) is soft and waxy, somewhat similar to {{chem|P|4}}. Both have four atoms arranged in a [[tetrahedral]] structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond. This unstable allotrope, being molecular, is the most volatile, least [[Density|dense]] and most toxic. Yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapour, for example with liquid nitrogen. It is rapidly transformed into the grey arsenic by light. The yellow form has a density of 1.97 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;/&gt;

''Black arsenic'' is similar in structure to red phosphorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--10.1002/jlac.18440490302 Ueber Allotropie bei einfachen Körpern, als eine der Ursachen der Isomerie bei ihren Verbindungen (pp. 247–264)

--&gt;
It is glassy, brittle and a poor semiconductor. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic, each with a different structure, are found free in nature (the minerals arsenic ''[[sensu stricto]]'' and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite).

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of arsenic}}
Naturally occurring arsenic is composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;As.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, at least 33 [[radioisotope]]s have also been synthesized, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;As with a [[half-life]] of 80.3&amp;nbsp;days. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;As tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], with some exceptions.

At least 10 [[nuclear isomer]]s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenic's isomers is &lt;sup&gt;68m&lt;/sup&gt;As with a half-life of 111&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;/&gt;

===Chemistry===
When heated in air, arsenic [[oxidation|oxidizes]] to arsenic trioxide; the fumes from this reaction have an odour resembling [[garlic]]. This odour can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as [[arsenopyrite]] with a hammer. Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state. The liquid state appears at 20 atmospheres and above, which explains why the melting point is higher than the boiling point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;/&gt; Arsenic makes [[arsenic acid]] with concentrated [[nitric acid]], [[arsenious acid]] with dilute nitric acid, and [[arsenic trioxide]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|title=Arsenic|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.com/Arsenic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Arsenic compounds}}

Arsenic compounds resemble in some respects those of [[phosphorus]], which occupies the same group (column) of the [[periodic table]]. Arsenic is less commonly observed in the pentavalent state, however. The most common [[oxidation state]]s for arsenic are −3 ([[arsenide]]s, such as alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in arsenates(III) ([[arsenite]]s) and most organoarsenic compounds). Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As{{su|b=4|p=3−}} ions in the mineral [[skutterudite]]. In the +3 oxidation state, arsenic is typically pyramidal, owing to the influence of the [[lone pair]] of [[electrons]].

===Inorganic===
Arsenic forms colourless, odourless, crystalline oxides [[Arsenic trioxide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (&quot;[[white arsenic]]&quot;) and [[Arsenic pentoxide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], which are [[hygroscopic]] and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. [[Arsenic acid|Arsenic(V) acid]] is a weak acid. Its salts are called [[arsenate]]s, e.g., [[Paris Green]], [[calcium arsenate]], and [[lead hydrogen arsenate]]. The latter three have been used as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[insecticide]]s and [[poison]]s. The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoric acid]]. However, arsenite and [[arsenous acid]] contain arsenic bonded to three oxygen and not hydrogen atoms, in contrast to [[phosphite]] and [[phosphonic acid]], which contains a non-acidic P-H bond. Arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic, whereas phosphonic acid is not.

A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment ([[arsenic trisulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and realgar ([[tetraarsenic tetrasulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. Other sulfides include [[tetraarsenic trisulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still in fact three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html|title=Arsenic: arsenic(II) sulfide compound data|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=WebElements.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trifluoride, trichloride, tribromide, and triiodide of arsenic(III) are well known, whereas only AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the main pentahalide. [[Arsenic pentafluoride]] is stable at room temperature, whereas the [[Arsenic pentachloride|pentachloride]] is stable only below −50&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;/&gt;

===Organoarsenic compounds===
{{Main|organoarsenic chemistry}}
[[Image:Trimethylarsine-2D.png|left| 90px|thumb| Trimethylarsine]]
A large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known. Many were initially prepared for use in chemical warfare during World War I. Representative compounds have the formulae R&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;AsCl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (where R = alkyl and aryl, and x = 0,1,2). Cacodylic acid, which is of historic and practical interest, arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry.

===Alloys===
Arsenic is used as group 5 element as components of the [[III-V semiconductor]]s. [[Gallium arsenide]], [[indium arsenide]], and [[aluminium arsenide]] are used as semiconductor materials. The valence electron count of GaAs is the same as a pair of Si atoms, but the band structure is completely different, which results distinct bulk properties. Other arsenic alloys include [[cadmium arsenide]], [[gallium arsenide]].

[[Image:Native arsenic.jpg|200px|thumb|A large sample of native arsenic.]]

[[Mineral]]s with the formula MAsS and MAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Fe, Ni, Co) are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic, together with [[realgar]] (an arsenic sulfide mineral) and native arsenic. An illustrative mineral is [[arsenopyrite]]&lt;!--, also unofficially called mispickel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Geology Today|volume = 18|issue = 2|pages = 72–75|title = Minerals explained 35: Arsenopyrite|first =R.

Many minor As-containing minerals are known.

In addition to the inorganic forms mentioned above, arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;geosphere&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal = The Science of the Total Environment|volume = 249|issues = 1–3|year = 2000|pages = 297–312| doi = 10.1016/S0048-9697(99)00524-0|title = Arsenic in the geosphere — a review|first = Jörg|last = Matschullat|pmid = 10813460|issue = 1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other naturally occurring pathways of exposure include volcanic ash, weathering of the arsenic-containing mineral and ores as well as groundwater. It is also found in food, water, soil, and air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HEC/CSEM/arsenic/docs/arsenic.pdf|title = Case Studies in Environmental Medicine (CSEM) Arsenic Toxicity Exposure Pathways.|publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry|accessdate = 2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common pathway of exposure for humans is ingestion, and the predominant source of arsenic in our diet is through seafood.&lt;ref name=&quot;atsdr.cdc.gov&quot;&gt;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2009).

In 2005, China was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 50% world share, followed by Chile, Peru and Morocco, reports the [[British Geological Survey]] and the [[United States Geological Survey]].&lt;ref name =&quot;USGSCS2006&quot;/&gt; Most operations in the US and Europe closed for environmental reasons. The arsenic is recovered mainly as a side product from the purification of copper. Arsenic is part of the smelter dust from copper, gold and lead smelters.&lt;ref name=USGSYB2007/&gt;

[[Image:Arsenic alchemical symbol.svg|75px|thumb|[[Alchemical symbol]] for arsenic]]
The word ''arsenic'' was borrowed from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word ܠܐ ܙܐܦܢܝܐ ''(al) zarniqa'' &lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arsenic|title = arsenic |accessdate = 2010-05-15| publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|زرنيخ}} ''Zarnikh'', meaning &quot;yellow [[orpiment]]&quot;, into [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''arsenikon'' (Αρσενικόν). It is also related to the similar Greek word ''arsenikos'' (Αρσενικός), meaning &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;potent&quot;. The word was adopted in Latin ''arsenicum'' and Old French ''arsenic,'' from which the English word ''arsenic'' is derived.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline.com&quot;/&gt; Arsenic sulfides (orpiment, [[realgar]]) and oxides have been known and used since ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curiosa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title = Arsenic Curiosa and Humanity|journal = The Chemical Educator |volume = 7| issue = 2|year = 2002|pages = 51|first = Ronald|last = Bentley|url = http://192.129.24.144/licensed_materials/00897/sbibs/s0007002/spapers/720051rb.pdf|doi = 10.1007/s00897020539a|last2 = Chasteen|first2 = Thomas G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]] (circa 300 AD) describes roasting ''sandarach'' (realgar) to obtain ''cloud of arsenic'' ([[arsenious oxide]]), which he then reduces to metallic arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Makers of Chemistry|author=Holmyard John Eric|publisher=Read Books|year=2007|isbn=1406732753}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the symptoms of [[arsenic poisoning]] were somewhat ill-defined, it was frequently used for [[murder]] until the advent of the [[Marsh test]], a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the [[Reinsch test]].)

[[Albertus Magnus]] (Albert the Great, 1193–1280) is believed to have been the first to isolate the element in 1250 by heating soap together with [[arsenic trisulfide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBlocks451-3&quot;/&gt; In 1649, [[Johann Schröder]] published two ways of preparing arsenic.

[[Cadet's fuming liquid]] (impure [[cacodyl]]), often claimed as the first synthetic [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic compound]], was synthesized in 1760 by [[Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt]] by the reaction of [[potassium acetate]] with [[arsenic trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Cadet's Fuming Arsenical Liquid and the Cacodyl Compounds of Bunsen|first = Dietmar|last = Seyferth|journal = Organometallics|year = 2001|volume = 20|issue = 8|pages = 1488–1498|doi = 10.1021/om0101947|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/orgnd7/2001/20/i08/abs/om0101947.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Agricultural===
[[Image:Roxarsone.png|thumb|140px|[[Roxarsone]] is a controversial arsenic compound used as a nutritional supplement for chickens.]]
The toxicity of arsenic to [[insect]]s, [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] led to its use as a wood preservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2134/jeq2004.0173 |last1 = Rahman |first1 = FA |last2 = Allan |first2 = DL |last3 = Rosen |first3 = CJ |last4 = Sadowsky |first4 = MJ |title = Arsenic availability from chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated wood |journal = Journal of environmental quality |volume = 33 |issue = 1 |pages = 173–80 |year = 2004 |pmid = 14964372}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s a process of treating wood with [[chromated copper arsenate]] (also known as CCA or [[Tanalith]]) was invented, and for decades this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic. An increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic resulted in a ban for the use of CCA in consumer products; the [[European Union]] and United States initiated this process in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Environmental Chemistry: Green Chemistry and Pollutants in Ecosystems|editors = Lichtfouse, Eric; Schwarzbauer, Jan; Robert, Didier|year = 2004|isbn = 9783540228608|url = http://books.google.com/?id=IDGLh_cWAIwC|chapter = Electrodialytical Removal of Cu, Cr and As from Threaded Wood|first = Eric|last = Lichtfouse |publisher = Springer|location = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;round&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Talanta|volume = 58|issue = 1|year = 2002|pages = 201–235|doi = 10.1016/S0039-9140(02)00268-0|title = Arsenic round the world: a review|first = Badal Kumar|last = Mandal|pmid = 18968746|last2 = Suzuki|first2 = K. T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCA remains in heavy use in other countries however, e.g. Malaysian rubber plantations.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

Arsenic was also used in various [[agriculture|agricultural]] insecticides, termination and poisons. For example, [[lead hydrogen arsenate]] was a common [[insecticide]] on [[fruit tree]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last = Peryea|first = F.

In the second half of the 20th century, [[monosodium methyl arsenate]] (MSMA) and [[disodium methyl arsenate]] (DSMA) – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – have replaced lead arsenate in agriculture.

===Medical use===
During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds have been used as medicines, including [[arsphenamine]] (by [[Paul Ehrlich]]) and [[arsenic trioxide]] (by [[Thomas Fowler (inventor)|Thomas Fowler]]). Arsphenamine as well as [[neosalvarsan]] was indicated for [[syphilis]] and [[trypanosomiasis]], but has been superseded by modern [[antibiotics]]. Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 500 years, but most commonly in the treatment of [[cancer]]. The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]] that is resistant to [[all-trans retinoic acid|ATRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Antman |first = Karen H.|year = 2001|url= http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/6/suppl_2/1|title = The History of Arsenic Trioxide in Cancer Therapy|volume = 6|issue =Suppl 2|pages = 1–2|pmid = 11331433|doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.6-suppl_2-1|journal = The oncologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as [[Fowler's solution]] in [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Noncirrhotic presinusoidal portal hypertension associated with chronic arsenical intoxication|journal = Gastroenterology| year = 1975| volume = 68'| issue = 5 Pt 1|pages =1270–1277|pmid = 1126603|format = Free full text| last1 = Huet| first1 = P.

===Alloys===
The main use of metallic arsenic is for alloying with copper and especially lead. Lead components in automotive batteries are strengthened by the presence of a few percent of arsenic.  [[Gallium arsenide]] is an important [[semiconductor]] material, used in [[integrated circuit]]s. It is fabricated by [[chemical vapor deposition]]. Circuits made from GaAs are much faster (but also much more expensive) than those made in [[silicon]]. Unlike silicon it is [[direct bandgap]], and so can be used in [[laser diode]]s and [[LED]]s to directly convert [[electricity]] into [[light]].&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

===Military===
After [[World War I]], the United States built up a stockpile of {{gaps|20|000|tons}} of [[lewisite]] (ClCH=CHAsCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] that is a [[vesicant]] (blister agent) and [[lung]] irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and dumped into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] after the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://library.thinkquest.org/05aug/00639/en/w_chemical_blister.html|publisher = Code Red - Weapons of Mass Destruction |title = Blister Agents|accessdate = 2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States]] used [[Agent Blue]], a mixture of [[sodium cacodylate]] and its acid form, as one of the [[rainbow herbicides]] to deprive the Vietnamese of valuable crops.

===Other uses===

==Biological role==
[[Image:ArsenobetainePIC.svg|thumb| Arsenobetaine]]
Some species of [[bacteria]] obtain their energy by [[redox|oxidizing]] various fuels while [[redox|reducing]] arsenate to arsenite. Under oxidative environmental conditions some bacteria use arsenite, which is oxidized to arsenate as fuel for their metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stolz | first1 = John F. | last2 = Basu | first2 = Partha | last3 = Santini | first3 = Joanne M. | last4 = Oremland | first4 = Ronald S. | title = Arsenic and Selenium in Microbial Metabolism* | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 60 | pages = 107–30 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.60.080805.142053 | pmid=16704340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[enzyme]]s involved are known as [[Arsenate reductase (glutaredoxin)|arsenate reductases]] (Arr).

In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of [[photosynthesis]] in the absence of oxygen with arsenites as [[electron donor]]s, producing arsenates (just as ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). Researchers conjecture that, over the course of history, these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. One [[strain (biology)|strain]] PHS-1 has been isolated and is related to the [[γ-Proteobacterium]] ''[[Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii]]''.

Arsenic has been linked to epigenetic changes that are heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence and include DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes p16 and p53, thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis. These epigenetic events have been observed in ''in vitro'' studies with human kidney cells and ''in vivo'' tests with rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baccarelli|first=A.|year=2009|title=Epigenetics and environmental chemicals|journal=Current opinion in Pediatrics |issue=2 |volume=21 |pages=243–251 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32832925cc |pmid=19663042|last2=Bollati|first2=V.|pmc=3035853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and its other bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholis|first=I.|year=2009|title=Arsenite medicinal use, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and monitoring in human hair| journal=Biochimie| pmid=19527769| doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2009.06.003 |last2=Curis |last3=Deschamps|last4=Bénazeth|volume=91|pages=12601267 |first2=E.|first3=P.|first4=S.|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor will help in developing precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.

A. |last4=Chen |first4=R. |last5=Feinleib |first5=M. |title=Arsenic cancer risk confounder in southwest Taiwan data set}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above 150 parts per billion. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater, owing to the anoxic conditions of the subsurface. This groundwater began to be used after local and western [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and the Bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube [[Water well|well]] drinking-water program in the late twentieth century. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteria-contaminated surface waters, but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater. Many other countries and districts in [[Southeast Asia|South East Asia]], such as [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[China]] have geological environments conducive to generation of high-arsenic groundwaters. [[Arsenic_poisoning#Arsenicosis:_chronic_arsenic_poisoning_from_drinking_water|Arsenicosis]] was reported in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Thailand]] in 1987, and the dissolved arsenic in the [[Chao Phraya River]] is suspected of containing high levels of naturally occurring arsenic, but has not been a public health problem owing to the use of bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 28th WEDC Conference Calcutta|year = 2002|url = http://wedc.lboro.ac.uk/conferences/pdfs/28/Kohnhorst.pdf|title = Groundwater arsenic in central Thailand|first1 = Andrew|last1 = Kohnhorst|first2 = Allan |last2 = Laird|first3 = Pokethitiyoke|last3 = Prayad|first4 = Anyapo|last4 = Suthida|accessdate = 2009-01-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, arsenic is most commonly found in the ground waters of the southwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://h2oc.com/pdfs/Occurrence.pdf|title = Arsenic in Drinking Water: 3. Occurrence in U.S. Waters|accessdate = 2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of [[New England]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]] and the Dakotas are also known to have significant{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} concentrations of arsenic in ground water. Increased levels of skin cancer have been associated with arsenic exposure in Wisconsin, even at levels below the 10 part per billion drinking water standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Association of arsenic-contaminated drinking-water with prevalence of skin cancer in Wisconsin's Fox River Valley |journal=J.

A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a recent film funded by the US [[Superfund]], millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels, and in some areas of the US, over 20% of wells may contain levels that exceed established limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~toxmetal/InSmallDoses/ |title=In Small Doses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-level exposure to arsenic at concentrations found commonly in US drinking water compromises the initial immune response to H1N1 or swine flu infection according to NIEHS-supported scientists. The study, conducted in laboratory mice, suggests that people exposed to arsenic in their drinking water may be at increased risk for more serious illness or death in response to infection from the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Courtney|first=D|year=2009|title=Low Dose Arsenic Compromises the Immune Response to Influenza A Infection in vivo|pages=1441–7|pmid=19750111| magazine=Environ Health Perspect|pmc=2737023|issue=9|doi=10.1289/ehp.0900911|last2=Ely|volume=117|first2=Kenneth H.|last3=Enelow|first3=Richard I.|last4=Hamilton|first4=Joshua W.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiological evidence from [[Chile]] shows a dose-dependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer, in particular when other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, are present. These effects have been demonstrated to persist below 50 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arsenic exposure and its impact on health in Chile |journal=J Health Popul Nutr |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=164–75 |year=2006 |pmid=17195557|format=Free full text |last1=Ferreccio |first1=C. |last2=Sancha |first2=A. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyzing multiple epidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests a small but measurable risk increase for bladder cancer at 10 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chu|first1= H. A. |last2 = Crawford-Brown|first2= D. J. |title=Inorganic arsenic in drinking water and bladder cancer: a meta-analysis for dose-response assessment |journal=Int. J. Environ. Res.

If they all consumed exactly 10 parts per billion arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.

Early (1973) evaluations of the removal of dissolved arsenic by drinking water treatment processes demonstrated that arsenic is very effectively removed by co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. The use of iron as a coagulant, in particular, was found to remove arsenic with efficiencies exceeding 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Removal of Arsenic (V) from Water by Adsorption on Aluminum and Ferric Hydroxides|journal=J.

L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for point-of-service use in a study funded by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S.EPA) and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF). A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in [[West Bengal]] based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left as an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and thus developing an oxidation zone to support arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.insituarsenic.org|title = In situ arsenic treatment|accessdate = 2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field [[gradient]]s have been demonstrated in point-of-use water purification with high-surface-area and [[monodisperse]] [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) [[nanocrystal]]s. Using the high specific surface area of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Yavuz|first = Cafer T|title = Low-Field Magnetic Separation of Monodisperse Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Nanocrystals|journal = Science|year = 2005|doi = 10.1126/science.1131475|volume = 314|issue = 5801|pages = 964–967|pmid = 17095696|last2 = Mayo|first2 = J.

Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality. The literature provides reason to believe arsenic exposure is causative in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

===Wood preservation in the US===
As of 2002, US-based industries consumed 19,600 metric tons of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with [[chromated copper arsenate]] (CCA). In 2007, 50% of the 5,280 metric tons of consumption was still used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=USGSYB2007&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.er.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/arsenic/myb1-2007-arsen.pdf|first = William E.|last = Brooks|publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate = 2008-11-08|title = Minerals Yearbook 2007: Arsenic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.er.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/arsenic/160302.pdf|first = Robert G.|last = Reese, Jr|publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate = 2008-11-08|title = Commodity Summaries 2002: Arsenic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the use of arsenic in consumer products was discontinued for residential, and general consumer construction on December 31, 2003 and alternative chemicals are now used, such as [[Alkaline Copper Quaternary]], [[borate]]s, [[Wood_preservation#Copper_azole|copper azole]], cyproconazole, and [[propiconazole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/reregistration/cca/|title=Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA)|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older [[Timber treatment|pressure-treated]] wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor [[building material]]. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding [[soil]] (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20&amp;nbsp;grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber do not exist evenly throughout the world; there is also concern in some quarters about the widespread [[landfill]] disposal of such timber.

===Mapping of industrial releases in the US===
One tool that maps releases of arsenic to particular locations in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/toxmap/tri/mapIt.do?chemicalName=arsenic |title=TRI Releases Map |publisher=Toxmap.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also provides additional information about such releases is [[TOXMAP]]. TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov TOXNET - Databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

==Toxicity and precautions==
{{Main|Arsenic poisoning|Arsenic toxicity}}
[[Image:Skull and crossbones.svg|left|80px]]
Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons. Many water supplies close to mines are contaminated by these poisons. Arsenic disrupts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through several mechanisms. At the level of the [[citric acid cycle]], arsenic inhibits [[lipoic acid]], which is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]; and by competing with phosphate it uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]], mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system [[organ failure]], it is presumed from [[necrotic]] cell death, not [[apoptosis]]. A [[post mortem]] reveals brick-red-coloured [[mucosa]], owing to severe [[haemorrhage]]. Although arsenic causes toxicity, it can also play a protective role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=512|publisher = McGraw-Hill|isbn = 978-0071389143|title = Casarett and Doull's Essentials of Toxicology|year = 2003| first1 = Curtis|last1 = Klaassen|last2= Watkins |first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as &quot;[[toxicity|toxic]]&quot; and &quot;dangerous for the environment&quot; in the [[European Union]] under [[directive 67/548/EEC]].
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-001-00-X (arsenic) R23/25-50/53; S1/2-20/21-28-45-60-61 --&gt;
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-002-00-5 (other compounds) pareil --&gt;The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogens]], and the EU lists arsenic trioxide, [[arsenic pentoxide]] and [[arsenate]] salts as category 1 [[carcinogen]]s.

Arsenic is known to cause [[Arsenic poisoning#Arsenicosis: chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking water|arsenicosis]] owing to its manifestation in drinking water, “the most common species being arsenate [HAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ; As(V)] and arsenite [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ; As(III)]”. The ability of arsenic to undergo redox conversion between As(III) and As(V) makes its availability in the environment more abundant. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, “[the] understanding [of] what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for bioremediation of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Genetics of Geochemisty|journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=38 |year=2004 |pages=175–206|pmid=15568975 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.38.072902.091138|last1=Croal|first1=Laura R. |last2=Gralnick |first2=Jeffrey A. |last3=Malasarn |first3=Davin |last4=Newman |first4=Dianne K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is easily accomplished. British anti-lewisite ([[dimercaprol]]) is prescribed in dosages of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg up to 300&amp;nbsp;mg each 4&amp;nbsp;hours for the first day. Then administer the same dosage each 6&amp;nbsp;hours for the second day. Then prescribe this dosage each 8&amp;nbsp;hours for eight additional days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychiatric, Psychogenic ans Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook |location=New Hyde Park, NY|publisher=Medical Examination Publishing Co |year=1978 |pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that the long-term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;atsdr.cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic, however these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes due to the exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;atsdr.cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Excretion occurs in the urine and long-term exposure to arsenic has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs and nasal cavity.&lt;ref&gt;The Tox Guide for Arsenic (2007). The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.Retrieved at http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-2.pdf?id=21&amp;tid=3and long&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational exposure and [[arsenic poisoning]] may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Antimony''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|n|t|ɨ|m|ɵ|n|i}} {{respell|AN|ti-mo-nee}};&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In the UK, the variable vowel {{IPA|/ɵ/}} is usually pronounced as a schwa {{IPA|[ə]}}; in the US, it is generally a full {{IPA|[oʊ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|stibium}}) is a toxic [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Sb''' and an [[atomic number]] of 51.  A lustrous grey [[metalloid]], it is found in nature mainly as the [[sulfide mineral]] [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  Although the use of antimony is limited by its toxicity, its compounds have been of fundamental value in chemistry - a prominent example being the development of [[superacid]]s derived from [[antimony pentafluoride]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  Antimony compounds are prominent [[fire retardant]]s found in many commercial and domestic products.  Certain [[alloy]]s are valuable for use in [[solder]]s and [[ball bearing]]s.  An emerging application is the use of antimony in [[microelectronics]].

==History==
[[File:antimony-symbol.svg|left|70px|thumb|alt=An unshaded circle surmounted by a cross.|One of the [[alchemical symbol]]s for antimony]]
Antimony's sulfide compound, [[antimony(III) sulfide]], Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was recognized in antiquity, at least as early as [[4th millennium BC|3000 BC]]; its original discoverers remain shrouded in mystery.

An artefact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at [[Girsu|Tello]], [[Chaldea]] (part of present-day [[Iraq]]), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt; One contemporary (Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone, published in 1892) was reported&lt;ref name=moorey&gt;{{cite book |last = Moorey|first = P. R. S.|year=1994|title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: the Archaeological Evidence|place=New York |publisher=Clarendon Press|page=241|url = http://books.google.com/?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA241 |isbn =9781575060422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to comment that &quot;we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal, which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase, and therefore this remarkable 'find' must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable.&quot;&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt;  However, Moorey was unconvinced that the artefact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Telloh object (published in 1975), &quot;attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony&quot; (i.e. native metal) and that &quot;the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments.&quot;&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt;  This weakens the evidence for a lost art &quot;of rendering antimony malleable.&quot;

The first European description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book ''[[De la pirotechnia]]'' of 1540 by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]]. This book predates the more famous 1556 book by [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]], ''[[De re metallica]]'', even though Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony.  A text describing the preparation of metallic antimony that was published in Germany in 1604 purported to date from the early fifteenth century, and if authentic it would predate Biringuccio. The book, written in Latin, was called &quot;Currus Triumphalis Antimonii&quot; (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), and its putative author was a certain [[Benedictine]] monk, writing under the name [[Basilius Valentinus]].&lt;ref name=priesner&gt;Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von [[Leibniz]], after careful inquiry, concluded that the work was spurious, that there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the book's author was its ostensible editor, Johann [[Thölde]] (ca. 1565-ca. 1624). There is now agreement among professional historians that the ''Currus Triumphalis...'' was written after the middle of the sixteenth century and that Thölde was likely its author.{{cite book|editor=Priesner, Claus and Figala, Karin|year=1998|title=Alchemie. Lexikon einer hermetischen Wissenschaft|place= München|publisher=C.H. Beck|language=German|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;s.v. &quot;Basilius Valentinus.&quot; Harold Jantz was perhaps the only modern scholar to deny Thölde's authorship, but he too agrees that the work dates from after 1550: see his [http://microformguides.gale.com/Data/Download/2025000R.pdf catalogue of German Baroque literature].&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation of the &quot;[[Currus Triumphalis]]&quot; appeared in English in 1660, under the title [[The Triumphant Chariot of Antimony]]. The work remains of great interest, chiefly because it documents how followers of the renegade German physician, Philippus Theophrastus [[Paracelsus]] von Hohenheim (of whom Thölde was one), came to associate the practice of alchemy with the preparation of chemical medicines.

Pure antimony was well known to [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], sometimes called &quot;the Father of Chemistry&quot;, in the 8th century. Here there is still an open controversy: [[Marcellin Berthelot]], who translated a number of Jābir's books, stated that antimony is never mentioned in them, but other authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|isbn = 9780521093668|url = http://books.google.com/?id=6kM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73|page = 73|author = Dampier, William Cecil |year = 1961|publisher = Cambridge U.P.|location = London|title = A history of science and its relations with philosophy &amp; religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Berthelot translated only some of the less important books, while the more interesting ones (some of which might describe antimony) are not yet translated, and their content is completely unknown.

The first natural occurrence of pure antimony ('native antimony') in the [[Earth's crust]] was described by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] scientist and local mine district engineer [[Anton von Swab]] in 1783. The [[Type locality (geology)|type-sample]] was collected from the [[Sala Silvermine]] in the Bergslagen mining district of [[Sala Municipality, Sweden|Sala]], [[Västmanland County|Västmanland]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-262.html|title = Native antimony|publisher =  Mindat.org|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], the sulfide of antimony. [[Pliny the Elder]], however, distinguishes between male and female forms of antimony; his male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, is probably native metallic antimony.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural history'', 33.33; W.H.S. Jones, the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translator, supplies a note suggesting the identifications.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians called antimony ''mśdmt''; in [[hieroglyphs]], the vowels are uncertain, but there is an Arabic tradition that the word is ميسديميت ''mesdemet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Albright|first = W. F. |title=Notes on Egypto-Semitic Etymology. II|journal=The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures |volume=34 |issue=4 |year=1918 |page=230 |jstor=528157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sarton&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarton, George|year=1935|title=Review of ''Al-morchid fi'l-kohhl, ou Le guide d'oculistique'', translated by Max Meyerhof |journal=Isis |volume=22 |issue=2 |page=541 |language=French |jstor=225136}} quotes Meyerhof, the translator of the book he is reviewing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word, ''στίμμι'' ''stimmi'', is probably a [[loan word]] from Arabic or Egyptian ''sdm'' &lt;hiero&gt;O34:D46-G17-F21:D4&lt;/hiero&gt;, and is used by the Attic [[tragic]] [[poet]]s of the 5th century BC; later Greeks also used ''στἰβι'' ''stibi'', as did [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names ''stimi'' [''sic''], ''larbaris'', [[alabaster]], and the &quot;very common&quot; ''platyophthalmos'', &quot;wide-eye&quot; (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as ''stibium''. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as تحميض، ثمود، وثمود، وثمود ''ithmid, athmoud, othmod'', or ''uthmod''. [[Littré]] suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from ''stimmida'', (one) accusative for ''stimmi''.&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]], ''s.v.'', vocalisation, spelling, and declension vary; Endlich, p.28; Celsus, 6.6.6 ff; Pliny ''Natural History'' 33.33; Lewis and Short: ''Latin Dictionary''. ''OED'', s. &quot;antimony&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of Sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to the 18th century chemical pioneer, [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], who used this abbreviation of the name ''stibium''. The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late [[Byzantine Greek]], take their names, is ''antimonium''. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The popular etymology, from ''ἀντίμοναχός'' ''anti-monachos'' or French ''antimoine'', still has adherents; this would mean &quot;monk-killer&quot;, and is explained by many early [[alchemist]]s being monks, and antimony being poisonous.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The use of a symbol resembling an upside down &quot;female&quot; symbol for antimony could also hint at a satirical pun in this origin&lt;/ref&gt; So does the hypothetical Greek word ''ἀντίμόνος'' ''antimonos'', &quot;against one&quot;, explained as &quot;not found as metal&quot;, or &quot;not found unalloyed&quot;.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 5th ed. 2004. Entry for antimony.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fernando, Diana|title=Alchemy : an illustrated A to Z|year=1998|publisher=Blandford|isbn=}} Fernando even derives it from the story of how &quot;Basil Valentine&quot; and his fellow monastic alchemists poisoned themselves by working with antimony; ''antimonium'' is found two centuries before his time. &quot;Popular etymology&quot; from ''OED''; as for ''antimonos'', the pure negative would be more naturally expressed by ''a-'' &quot;not&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lippmann conjectured a Greek word, ''ανθήμόνιον'' ''anthemonion'', which would mean &quot;floret&quot;, and he cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological [[efflorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, pp. 643–5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The early uses of ''antimonium'' include the translations, in 1050–1100, by [[Constantine the African]] of Arabic medical treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, p. 642, writing in 1919, says &quot;''zuerst''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Several authorities believe that ''antimonium'' is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from ''ithmid'';&lt;ref&gt;Meyerhof as quoted in Sarton, asserts that ''ithmid'' or ''athmoud'' became corrupted in the medieval &quot;traductions barbaro-latines&quot;.; the ''OED'' asserts that some Arabic form is the origin, and 
''if'' ''ithmid'' is the root, posits ''athimodium, atimodium, atimonium'', as intermediate forms.&lt;/ref&gt; other possibilities include ''Athimar'', the Arabic name of the ''metal'', and a hypothetical ''as-stimmi'', derived from or parallel to the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Endlich, p.28; one of the advantages of ''as-stimmi'' would be that it has a whole syllable in common with ''antimonium''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Properties===
[[File:Antimon.PNG|thumb|left|200px|alt=A clear vial containing small chunks of a slightly lustrous black solid, labeled &quot;Sb&quot;.|A vial containing a black allotrope of antimony]]
[[File:Antimony massive.jpg|thumb|alt=An irregular piece of silvery stone with spots of variation in lustre and shade.|Native antimony with [[redox|oxidation]] products]]
Antimony is in the [[nitrogen group]] (group 15) and has an [[electronegativity]] of 2.05. As expected by periodic trends, it is more electronegative than [[tin]] or [[bismuth]], and less electronegative than [[tellurium]] or [[arsenic]].

Antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with [[oxygen]] if heated to form [[antimony trioxide]], Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metal that has a [[Mohs scale]] hardness of 2. Therefore, antimony by itself is never used to make hard objects: a coin made of antimony, issued in the [[Guizhou Province]] of [[China]] in 1931, was unpopular because they would wear out fast. After the first issue no others were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcoinpics.co.uk/metal.html |title=Metals Used in Coins and Medals|publisher=ukcoinpics.co.uk|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is resistant to attack by acids.

Four [[allotropy|allotropes]] of antimony are known: a stable metallic form, and three meta-stable forms: explosive, black and yellow. Metallic antimony is a [[brittle]], silver-white shiny metal. When molten antimony is slowly cooled, metallic antimony crystallizes in an hexagonal cell, [[isomorphic]] with that of the black allotrope of [[arsenic]]. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony(III) trichloride. When scratched with a sharp implement, an [[exothermic]] reaction occurs and white fumes given off as metallic antimony is formed; alternatively, when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed when gaseous metallic antimony is rapidly cooled. It oxidizes in air and is sometimes spontaneously combustible. At 100 °C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of [[stibine]] (SbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at −90 °C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this meta stable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.&lt;ref name='cww'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wang | first1 = Chung Wu | title = Antimony: Its History, Chemistry, Minerology, Geology, Metallurgy, Uses, Preparation, Analysis, Production and Valuation with Complete Bibliographies | chapter = The Chemistry of Antimony | publisher = Charles Geiffin and Co.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of antimony}}
Antimony exists as two stable isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;121&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a [[half-life]] of 2.75 years. In addition, 29 [[nuclear isomer|metastable]] states have been characterised.

===Occurrence===
{{see also|Category:Antimonide minerals|Category:Antimonate minerals}}
The abundance of antimony in the [[Earth]]'s crust is estimated at 0.2 to 0.5 [[part per million|parts per million]], comparable to [[thallium]] at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=|title=Antimony Statistics and Information|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 [[mineral]] species. Antimony is sometimes found native, but more frequently it is found in the sulfide [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is the predominant ore [[mineral]]. Commercial forms of antimony are generally [[ingot]]s, broken pieces, [[granular material|granules]], and cast cake. Other forms are [[powder (substance)|powder]], shot, and [[single crystal]]s.

In 2005, [[China]] was the top producer of antimony with about 84% world share followed at a distance by [[South Africa]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Tajikistan]], reports the [[British Geological Survey]]. The mine with the largest deposits in China is [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]] Province with a estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0009-2541(03)00187-6|title = Samarium–neodymium isotope systematics of hydrothermal calcites from the Xikuangshan antimony deposit (Hunan, China): the potential of calcite as a geochronometer|year = 2003|last1 = Peng|first1 = J|journal = Chemical Geology|volume = 200|pages = 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Antimony (mined)2.PNG|thumb|right|Antimony output in 2005]]
[[File:Antimony - world production trend.svg|thumb|World production trend of antimony]]
The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality of the ore, which is usually a sulfide.  The sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered from roasting.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide.  Antimony can be isolated from its ore by a reduction with scrap iron: 
:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 3Fe → 2Sb + 3FeS

Isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction:&lt;ref name='webelsb'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webelements.com/antimony/ | title = WebElements: Antimony: Essential Information | accessdate = 2010-07-09 | publisher = [[Webelements.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compounds==
{{see also|Category:Antimony compounds}}
Antimony compounds are often classified into those of Sb(III) and Sb(V).&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;  Relative to its neighboring element As, the 5+ oxidaton state is more stable.

===Oxides and hydroxides===
[[Antimony trioxide]] ({{chem|Sb|4|O|6}}) is formed when antimony is burnt in air.&lt;ref name=&quot;reger2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, [[antimony tetroxide]] ({{chem|Sb|2|O|4}}), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V).&lt;ref name=&quot;house&quot;/&gt; Unlike [[phosphorus]] and [[arsenic]], these various oxides are [[amphoteric]] and do not form well-defined [[oxoacid]]s and react with acids to form antimony salts. 

Antimonous acid {{chem|Sb(OH)|3}} is unknown but the conjugate base sodium antimonite ({{chem|[Na|3|SbO|3|]|4}}) forms upon fusing [[sodium oxide]] and {{chem|Sb|4|O|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|763}} Transition metal antimonites are also known.&lt;ref name=&quot;norman&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Halides===
Antimony forms two series of [[halide]]s, {{chem|SbX|3}} and {{chem|SbX|5}}. The trihalides [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]], [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]], [[antimony tribromide|{{chem|SbBr|3}}]], and [[antimony triiodide|{{chem|SbI|3}}]] are all molecular compounds having [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]]. The trifluoride {{chem|SbF|3}} is prepared by the reaction of {{chem|Sb|2|O|3}} with [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|761–762}}
:{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}}  +  6 HF  →  2 {{chem|SbF|3}}  +  3 {{chem|H|2|O}}

It is [[Lewis acid]]ic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions {{chem|SbF|4|-}} and {{chem|SbF|5|2-}}. Molten {{chem|SbF|3}} is a weak [[electrical conductor]].  The trichloride {{chem|SbCl|3}} is prepared by dissolving [[stibnite|{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}]] in [[hydrochloric acid]]:
:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}  +  6 HCl →   2 {{chem|SbCl|3}}  +  3 {{chem|H|2|S}}
[[Image:Antimony-pentafluoride-monomer-3D-balls.png|thumb|120px|left|Structure of gaseous SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The pentahalides {{chem|SbF|5}} and {{chem|SbCl|5}} have [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]] in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase, {{chem|SbF|5}} is [[polymer]]ic, whereas {{chem|SbCl|5}} is monomeric.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus. Antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form antimony oxo- (antimonyl) compounds such as SbOCl and {{chem|(SbO)|2|SO|4}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|764}}

===Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds===
Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Antimony forms ''antimonides'' with metals, such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), and silver antimonide ({{chem|Ag|3|Sb}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|760}}  The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, e.g. Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb and Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas [[stibine]], {{chem|SbH|3}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{chem|Sb|3-}} + 3 {{chem|H|+}} → {{chem|SbH|3}}
Stibine can also be produced by treating {{chem|Sb|3+}} salts with hydride reagents such as [[sodium borohydride]]. Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature.  Because stibine is thermodynamically unstable (positive [[heat of formation]]), antimony does not react with hydrogen directly.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organoantimony chemistry|Organoantimony compound]]s are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with [[Grignard reagent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Elschenbroich, C. ”Organometallics” (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-29390-6&lt;/ref&gt;  A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations.  Examples include Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[triphenylstibine]]), Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic [Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and several related halides.

==Applications==
===Flame retardants===
The main use of antimony is in the form of [[antimony trioxide]] is used in the making of [[flame retardant|flame-proofing compounds]]. Markets for these flame-retardant applications include children's clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers. It is also used in the [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] [[composite material|composites]] industry as an additive to [[polyester resin]]s for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn while a flame is held to it but will extinguish itself as soon as the flame is removed.  Fireproofing consumes about half of the annual production of antimony.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Sabina C. Grund, Kunibert Hanusch, Hans J.

===Other applications===
The second main application is as a catalyst for the production of the polymer [[polyethyleneterephthalate]].  It is an additive in some [[glass]]es.  In the latter application, antimony oxides serve as fining agents, aiding in the removal of microscopic bubbles.  This application is mainly used for TV screens.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard H.W. S. De Jong, Ruud G. C. Beerkens, Peter A. van Nijnatten &quot;Glass&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a12_365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche applications===
====Microelectronics====
In tiny amounts, antimony is increasingly being used in the [[semiconductor]] industry as a [[dopant]] for ultra-high conductivity [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=COcVgAtqeKkC&amp;pg=PA473|page=473|title=Handbook of semiconductor silicon technology |first1 =William C.|last1 =O'Mara| first2 = Robert B.|last2 =Herring| first3 = Lee Philip|last3 =Hunt|publisher=William Andrew|year=1990|isbn=9780815512370}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the production of [[diode]]s, [[infrared]] detectors, and [[Hall effect|Hall-effect]] devices. 

In the 1950s, tiny beads of a [[lead]]-antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of NPN [[alloy junction transistor]]s with antimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=_7fOlKRDcCkC&amp;pg=PA101|page = 101|title = Selected Works of Professor Herbert Kroemer |last = Maiti,|first=C. K.|publisher=World Scientific, 2008|isbn=9789812709011|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical====
Few biological or medical applications exist for antimony. Treatments principally containing antimony are known as [[antimonial]]s and are used as [[emetic]]s. 

Antimony compounds are used as [[Antiprotozoal agent|antiprotozoan]] drugs. [[Tartaric Acid#Derivatives|Antimony potassium tartrate]], or tartar emetic, was once used as an anti-[[Schistosomiasis|schistosomal]] drug, subsequently replaced by [[praziquantel]].

Antimony and its compounds are used in several [[veterinary]] preparations like anthiomaline or lithium antimony thiomalate, which is used as a skin conditioner in [[ruminant]]s. 

Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on [[keratinized]] tissues, at least in animals. 
Antimony-based drugs, such as [[meglumine antimoniate]], are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of [[leishmaniasis]] in [[domestic animal]]s. Unfortunately, as well as having low [[therapeutic index|therapeutic indices]], the drugs are poor at penetrating the [[bone marrow]], where some of the ''Leishmania'' [[amastigote]]s reside, and so cure of the disease – especially the visceral form – is very difficult.

Elemental antimony as an [[antimony pill]] was once used as a medicine. It could be reused by others after ingestion.

====Other uses====
In the heads of some safety matches &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =  http://books.google.com/?id=TyQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50|publisher = National Academies|year =  1970|author = National Research Council|title = Trends in usage of antimony: report|page = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[nuclear reactor]]s together with [[beryllium]] as [[startup neutron source]]s.


Antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite| journal|publisher= Journal of Wear|year=2000|author= Jang, H and Kim, S. |title= The effects of antimony trisulfide Sb S and zirconium silicate in the automotive brake friction material on friction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Antimony and many of its compounds are [[toxic]], and the effects of antimony poisoning are similar to [[arsenic poisoning]]. Inhalation of antimony dust is harmful and in certain cases may be fatal; in small doses, antimony causes [[headache]]s, [[dizziness]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Larger doses such as prolonged skin contact may cause dermatitis; otherwise it can damage the kidneys and the liver, causing violent and frequent [[vomiting]], and will lead to death in a few days.

Antimony is incompatible with strong oxidizing agents, strong acids, halogen acids, chlorine, or fluorine. It should be kept away from heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mallbaker.com/americas/msds/english/a7152_msds_us_default.pdf MSDS], Baker&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actinium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|i|əm}} {{respell|ak|TIN|nee-əm}}) is a radioactive [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Ac''' and [[atomic number]] 89, which was discovered in 1899. It was the first [[Primordial element|non-primordial radioactive element]] to be isolated. [[Polonium]], [[radium]] and [[radon]] were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902. Actinium gave the name to the [[actinide]] series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and [[lawrencium]] in the [[periodic table]].

Actinium is a soft, silvery-white [[radioactive]] metal. It reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As most [[lanthanide]]s and actinides, actinium assumes [[oxidation state]] +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] ores as &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac [[isotope]], which decays with a [[half-life]] of 21.773 years, predominantly emitting [[beta particle]]s. One [[tonne]] of [[uranium]] ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and [[lanthanum]] makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;{{radium}} in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for [[radiation therapy]] targeting cancer cells in the body.

==History==
[[André-Louis Debierne]], a French chemist, announced the discovery of a new element in 1899. He separated it from [[uraninite|pitchblende]] residues left by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] after they had extracted [[radium]]. Debierne and described the substance (in 1899) as similar to [[titanium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-active |first = André-Louis|last = Debierne|journal = Comptes rendus|volume = 129|pages = 593–595|year = 1899|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3085b/f593.table|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in 1900) as similar to [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-actif – l'actinium|first = André-Louis|last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus|volume = 130|pages = 906–908|year = 1900–1901|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3086n/f906.table|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]] independently discovered actinium in 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber Radium und radioactive Stoffe|first = Friedrich Oskar|last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft|volume = 35|issue = 3|pages = 3608–3611|year = 1902|doi = 10.1002/cber.190203503187|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a substance being similar to [[lanthanum]] and called it &quot;emanium&quot; in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber den Emanationskörper (Emanium) |first = Friedrich Oskar|last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft|volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 1696–1699|year = 1904|doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a comparison of substances in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur l'actinium|first = André-Louis|last = Debierne|journal = Comptes rendus|volume = 139|pages = 538–540|year = 1904|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debierne's name was retained because it had seniority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber Emanium|first = Friedrich Oskar|last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft|volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 1696–1699|year = 1904|doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber Emanium|first = Friedrich Oskar|last = Giesel|journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft|volume = 38|issue = 1|pages = 775–778|year = 1905|doi = 10.1002/cber.190503801130|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated history of the discovery of actinium remained questionable for decades. Articles published in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Discovery of Actinium |first = H. W.|last = Kirby |journal = Isis|volume = 62|issue = 3|pages = 290–308 
|year = 1971|jstor=229943|doi =10.1086/350760}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The centenary of a controversial discovery: actinium|first = J. P.|last = Adloff |journal = Radiochim. Acta|volume = 88|pages = 123–128|year = 2000|doi = 10.1524/ract.2000.88.3-4.123|issue = 3–4_2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that Debierne's results published in 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Whether Debierne and Giesel should share the merit of discover or if Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery is still under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kirby|first1 = Harold W.|last2 = Morss|first2 = Lester R.|title = Actinium|pages = 18|year = 2006|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-3598-5_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name actinium originates from the Greek ''aktis, aktinos'' (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of such chemicals as [[acetyl]], [[acetate]] and [[acetaldehyde]].

==Properties==
Actinium is a soft, silvery-white,&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;&quot;Actinium&quot; Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th edition, 1995, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; [[radioactive]], metallic element. Its estimated [[shear modulus]] is similar to that of [[lead]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Seitz, David Turnbull [http://books.google.com/books?id=F9V3a-0V3r8C&amp;pg=PA289 Solid state physics: advances in research and applications], Academic Press, 1964 ISBN 0126077169 pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light. Actinium has similar chemical properties as [[lanthanum]] and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and [[ion chromatography]] are commonly used for the separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Chemistry of the Actinide Elements Annual Review of Nuclear Science|volume = 1|pages = 245–262|year = 1952|first = J. J.|last = Katz|doi = 10.1146/annurev.ns.01.120152.001333|journal = Annual Review of Nuclear Science|last2 = Manning|first2 = W M}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Actinium is the first element of the [[actinide]]s and gave the group its name, similar to [[lanthanum]] for the [[lanthanide]]s. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it took until 1945 when [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] proposed the most significant change to [[Mendeleev]]'s [[periodic table]], by introducing the actinides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Transuranium Elements|first = Glenn T.|last = Seaborg|journal = Science|volume = 104|issue = 2704|year = 1946|pages = 379–386|jstor=1675046|doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379|pmid = 17842184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title = Preparation of Actinium Metal|first = Joseph G.|last = Stites|journal = J.

==Chemical compounds==
Only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including AcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Except for AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds and contain actinium in the oxidation state +3.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Preparation and Identification of Some Pure Actinium Compounds|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|last = Sherman|first = Fried|pages = 771–775|doi = 10.1021/ja01158a034|year =1950|volume = 72|last2 = Hagemann|first2 = French|last3 = Zachariasen|first3 = W.

Here ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are lattice constants, No is space group number and ''Z'' is the number of [[formula unit]]s per [[unit cell]]. Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters.

===Oxides===
Actinium oxide (Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500 °C or the [[oxalate]] at 1100 °C, in vacuum. It crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===Halides===
Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding [[hydrofluoric acid]] to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 °C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with [[ammonium hydroxide]] at 900–1000 °C yields [[oxyfluoride]] AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 °C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;&lt;ref name=m87&gt;Meyer, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

:AcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → AcOF + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F

Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or [[oxalate]] with [[carbon tetrachloride]] vapors at temperatures above 960 °C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium [[oxychloride]] can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with [[ammonium hydroxide]] at 1000 °C. However, in contrast to the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in [[hydrochloric acid]] with [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

Reaction of aluminium bromide and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide:
:Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 AcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500 °C results in the oxybromide AcOBr.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===Other compounds===
Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300 °C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing [[monosodium phosphate]] (NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·0.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and heating actinium oxalate with [[hydrogen sulfide]] vapors at 1400 °C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000 °C.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of actinium}}
Naturally occurring actinium is composed of one radioactive [[isotope]]; {{chem|227|Ac}}. Thirty-six [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, the most stable being {{chem|227|Ac}} with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 years, {{chem|225|Ac}} with a half-life of 10.0 days and {{chem|226|Ac}} with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than 1 minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is {{chem|217|Ac}} (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through [[alpha decay]] and [[electron capture]]. Actinium also has two [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|pages = 3–128|publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purified {{chem|227|Ac}} comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days. It decays according to its 21.773-year half-life emitting mostly beta (98.8%) and some alpha particles (1.2%);&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article008169.html Actinium], [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; the successive decay products are part of the [[actinium series]]. Owing to the low available amounts, low energy of its beta particles (46 keV) and low intensity of alpha radiation, {{chem|227|Ac}} is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt; The isotopes of actinium range in [[atomic weight]] from 206&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] ({{chem|206|Ac}}) to 236&amp;nbsp;u ({{chem|236|Ac}}).&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;/&gt;

==Occurrence and synthesis==
[[File:Uraninite-39029.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Uraninite]] ores have elevated concentrations of actinium.]]
Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] ores as &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac – one tonne of ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01158a033|last1=Hagemann|year=1950|first1=French|pages=768|volume=72|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|title=The Isolation of Actinium|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g946&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actinium [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is a transient member of the [[Decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]] [[decay chain]], which begins with the parent isotope [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] (or [[Plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]) and ends with the stable lead isotope [[Isotopes of lead|&lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]. Another actinium isotope (&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac) is transiently present in the [[Decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] [[decay chain]], beginning with [[Neptunium|&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np]] (or [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U)]] and ending with near-stable [[bismuth]] (&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi).

The low natural concentration, and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved.&lt;ref name=j2&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01158a034|last1=Fried|year=1950|first1=Sherman|pages=771|volume=72|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|last2=Hagemann|first2=French|last3=Zachariasen|first3=W. H.|title=The Preparation and Identification of Some Pure Actinium Compounds|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;{{radium}} in a [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref name=g946/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{226}_{\ 88}Ra\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ \longrightarrow \ ^{227}_{\ 88}Ra\ \xrightarrow[42.2 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{227}_{\ 89}Ac}&lt;/math&gt;

The reaction yield is about 2% of the radium weight. &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-[[benzene]] solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the [[pH]] (to about 6.0 for actinium).&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate [[resin]] in [[nitric acid]], which can result in a separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as [[eluant]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was first produced artificially at the [[Institute for Transuranium Elements]] (ITU) in Germany using a [[cyclotron]] and at [[St George Hospital, Sydney|St George Hospital]] in Sydney using a [[Linear particle accelerator|linac]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.11.012|year = 2009|author = Melville, G; Allen, Bj|title = Cyclotron and linac production of Ac-225|volume = 67|issue = 4|pages = 549–55|pmid = 19135381|journal = Applied radiation and isotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium-226 target with 20–30 MeV [[deuterium]] ions. This reaction also yields &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ac which however decays with a half-life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela J. Russell, Paul Jackson, Elizabeth Anne Kingsley [http://books.google.com/books?id=K1y6k5bdlWkC&amp;pg=PA336 Prostate cancer methods and protocols], Humana Press, 2003, ISBN 0896039781, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with [[lithium]] vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300 °C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = C. R. Hammond |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition| publisher =CRC press| isbn = 0849304857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==
Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium currently has no significant industrial use,&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;!--http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4066566--&gt; however, potential applications are being developed. 

&lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft. The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac pressed with [[beryllium]] is also an efficient [[neutron source]] with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium-beryllium and radium-beryllium pairs.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Alan M. Russell, Kok Loong Lee [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA470 Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals], Wiley, 2005, ISBN 047164952X, pp. 470–471&lt;/ref&gt; In all those applications, &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac (a beta source) is merely a progenitor which generates alpha-emitting isotopes upon its decay. Beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction: 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;AcBe neutron sources can be applied in a [[neutron probe]] – a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction.&lt;ref&gt;D.

This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac itself, but also its decay products emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its decay products might induce new mutations. In order to solve this problem, &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was bound to a [[Chelation|chelating]] agent, such as [[citrate]], [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA) or [[pentetic acid|diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid]] (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Improved in Vivo Stability of Actinium-225 Macrocyclic Complexes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DOTA (chelate)|DOTA]] (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to [[trastuzumab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] that interferes with the [[HER2/neu]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].

The medium half-life of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac (21.77 years) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Its decay product, &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa decays to &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nozaki|first1=Yoshiyuki|title=Excess 227Ac in deep ocean water|journal=Nature|volume=310|pages=486|year=1984|doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geibert|first1=W.|last2=Rutgers Van Der Loeff|first2=M.M.|last3=Hanfland|first3=C.|last4=Dauelsberg|first4=H.-J.|title=Actinium-227 as a deep-sea tracer: sources, distribution and applications|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=198|pages=147|year=2002|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00512-5|bibcode=2002E&amp;PSL.198..147G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats, about 33% of actinium is deposited into the bones and 50% into the liver.

'''Americium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|m|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|s|i|əm}} {{respell|AM|ə|RIS|ee-əm}}) is a [[synthetic element]] that has the symbol '''Am''' and [[atomic number]] 95. This [[transuranic element]] of the [[actinide]] series is located in the [[periodic table]] below the [[lanthanide]] element [[europium]], and thus by analogy was named after another continent, [[Americas|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Transuranium Elements|first = Glenn T.|last = Seaborg|journal = Science|volume = 104|issue = 2704|year = 1946|pages = 379–386|doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379|pmid = 17842184|jstor = 1675046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Although it is the third element in the [[transuranic element|transuranic series]], it was discovered fourth, after the heavier [[curium]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by bombarding [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] with [[alpha particle]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial [[ionization chamber]] [[smoke detectors]], as well as in [[neutron source]]s and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this [[nuclear isomer]].

Americium is a relatively soft [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] metal with silvery-white appearance. Its most common isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am. In chemical compounds, they usually assume the [[oxidation state]] +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +7 and can be identified via their characteristic [[optical absorption]] spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contains intrinsic defects, which are induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles and accumulate with time; this results in a drift of some material properties.

==History==
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|upright|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.]]
[[File:Americium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium (as the hydroxide), produced in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;LBL NEWS Magazine, Vol.6, No.3, Fall 1981, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. They used a 60-inch [[cyclotron]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Morgan/morgan.html Obituary of Dr. Leon Owen (Tom) Morgan (1919–2002)], Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) of the [[University of Chicago]]. Following the lighter [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], and heavier [[curium]], americium was the fourth [[transuranium element]] to be discovered. At the time, the [[periodic table]] had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the [[lanthanide]] one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after another continent, [[Americas|America]]: &quot;The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G. T.; James, R.A. and Morgan, L.

[http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0046&amp;numPages=43&amp;fp=N Abstract]; [http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0046.pdf Full text] (January 1948), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Street|first1=K.|last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.|title=The Isotopes of Americium|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.530|year=1950|page=530|volume=79|journal=Physical Review|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7073&amp;context=lbnl|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g1252&gt;Greenwood, p. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;

The new element was isolated from its [[oxide]]s in a complex, multi-step process. First [[plutonium]]-239 nitrate (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;PuNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm² area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]], and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]]. Further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]], yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Robert E. [http://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&amp;pg=PA322 The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0313334382 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pandemonium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|delirium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Am. [[Americium-241]] was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of one neutron. It decays by emission of a [[alpha particle|α-particle]] to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np; the [[half-life]] of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X|title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|year=1997|page=1|volume=624|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;small&gt; The times are [[half-life|half-lives]]&lt;/small&gt;

The second isotope &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already-created &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Upon rapid [[Beta-decay|β-decay]], &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts into the isotope of curium &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (which had been discovered previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which was close to the presently accepted value of 16.02 h.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

The discovery of americium and curium in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]]; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the [[Quiz Kids]], five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical &amp; Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate = 2010-07-07| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of americium isotopes &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, Glenn T. {{US patent|3156523}} &quot;Element&quot;, Filing date: 23 August 1946, Issue date: 10 November 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of [[americium(III) fluoride]] with [[barium]] metal in high vacuum at 1100 °C.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westrum|first1=Edgar F.|last2=Eyring|first2=Leroy|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=73|page=3396|year=1951|doi=10.1021/ja01151a116|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|Americium was detected in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
The longest-lived and most common isotopes of americium, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, all [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now. Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]] conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as [[Chernobyl disaster]]. For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (November 1, 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium. Due to military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P.|last2=Studier|first2=M.|last3=Diamond|first3=H.|last4=Mech|first4=J.|last5=Inghram|first5=M.|last6=Pyle|first6=G.|last7=Stevens|first7=C.|last8=Fried|first8=S.|last9=Manning|first9=W.|title=Transplutonium Elements in Thermonuclear Test Debris|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|page=180|year=1956|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevated levels of americium were also detected at the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crash site]] of the US B-52 bomber, which carried four hydrogen bombs, in 1968 in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eriksson, Mats|title=On Weapons Plutonium in the Arctic Environment|publisher=[[Lund University]]|date=April 2002|location=Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark|accessdate=2008-11-15|url=http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf|format=PDF|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other regions, the average radioactivity due to residual americium is only about 0.01 [[Curie|picocuries]]. Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in [[loam]] soils.&lt;ref name=am&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/americium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Americium], Los Alamos National Laboratory, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of various americium isotopes, mostly &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Klaus ''Kann man Gold machen?

From the history of the chemical elements), Urania-Verlag, Leipzig, Jena, Berlin 1979, no ISBN, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, have to be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as [[nuclear transmutation]], but it is still being developed for americium.&lt;ref&gt;Baetslé, L.

[[File:Elutionskurven Tb Gd Eu und Bk Cm Am.png|thumb|[[Chromatography|Chromatographic]] [[elution]] curves revealing the similarity between Tb, Gd, Eu lanthanides and corresponding Bk, Cm, Am actinides.]]

Americium has been produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s for decades, and kilograms of its &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am isotopes have been accumulated by now.&lt;ref name=g1262&gt;Greenwood, p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 [[United States dollar|USD]] per gram of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf57.html Smoke detectors and americium], World Nuclear Association, January 2009, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The heavier isotope &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate that results in a higher cost of the order 100–160 USD/mg.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C. R. &quot;The elements&quot; in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emeleus,H. J. [http://books.google.com/books?id=K5_LSQqeZ_IC&amp;pg=PA2 Advances in inorganic chemistry], Academic Press, 1987, ISBN 0120236311 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{239}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [23.5 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 93}Np\ \xrightarrow [2.3565 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 94}Pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The capture of two neutrons by &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {2(n,\gamma)} \ ^{241}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [14.35 \ yr]{\beta^-} \ ^{241}_{\ 95}Am}&lt;/math&gt;

The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;/&gt; However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu decays to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am after about 15 years, and the &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bredl.org/sapc/Pu_ReportI.htm BREDL Southern Anti-Plutonium Campaign], Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The obtained &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a [[light water reactor]] (LWR), 79% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 10% to its [[nuclear isomer]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am:&lt;ref group=note&gt;The &quot;metastable&quot; state is marked by letter m.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.41.448|author=Sasahara, A.

[[Americium-242]] has a half-life of only 16 hours, which makes its further up-conversion to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, extremely inefficient. The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu captures four neutrons under high [[neutron flux]]:

===Metal generation===
Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium need to be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) is dissolved in [[nitric acid]], and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a [[PUREX]]-type extraction ('''P'''lutonium –'''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a [[hydrocarbon]]. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a [[diamide]]-based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 34–48&lt;/ref&gt; with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of work has been done on the [[solvent extraction]] of americium. For example, a recent [[EU]] funded project codenamed &quot;EUROPART&quot; studied [[triazine]]s and other compounds as potential extraction agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Dalton Trans.]]|year = 2003|pages = 1675–1685|doi = 10.1039/b301178j|title = The coordination chemistry of 1,2,4-triazinyl bipyridines with lanthanide(III) elements – implications for the partitioning of americium(III)|author = Hudson, M.

==Physical properties==
[[File:Closest packing ABAC.png|thumb|Double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-americium (A: green, B: blue, C: red).]]

In the [[periodic table]], americium is located right to plutonium, left to curium, and below the lanthanide [[europium]], with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, americium is lighter than both curium (13.52&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and plutonium (19.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); but is heavier than europium (5.264&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower [[bulk modulus]] than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu.&lt;ref name=pressure/&gt; Its melting point of 1173&amp;nbsp;°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639&amp;nbsp;°C) and europium (826&amp;nbsp;°C), but lower than for curium (1340&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=W|title=Preparation and some properties of americium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=29|page=2577|year=1967|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(67)80183-0|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt;

At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal crystal symmetry]], and a [[space group]] P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc with lattice parameters ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 346.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and ''c''&amp;nbsp;= 1124&amp;nbsp;pm, and four atoms per [[unit cell]]. The crystal consists of a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmelin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McWhan|first1=D.B.|last2=Cunningham|first2=B.B.|last3=Wallmann|first3=J.C.|title=Crystal structure, thermal expansion and melting point of americium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=24|page=1025|year=1962|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(62)80246-2|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry, space group Fm{{overline|3}}m and lattice constant ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 489&amp;nbsp;pm. This ''fcc'' structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmelin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt; Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa.&lt;ref name=pressure&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U|title=Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=100|page=153|year=1984|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770&amp;nbsp;°C it changes into an ''fcc'' phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075&amp;nbsp;°C it converts to a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, [[praseodymium]] and [[neodymium]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, David A. [http://books.google.com/books?id=F2HVYh6wLBcC&amp;pg=PA226 Phase diagrams of the elements], University of California Press, 1991, ISBN 0520074831 pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced [[Interstitial defect|lattice defects]] is relatively low, by broadening of [[X-ray diffraction]] peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties, such as electrical [[resistivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U|last2=Dufour|first2=C|title=Low temperature lattice expansion of americium dioxide|journal=Physica B+C|volume=102|page=303|year=1980|doi=10.1016/0378-4363(80)90178-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm to 10&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at [[liquid helium]] to 69&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium, uranium, thorium and [[protactinium]], but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60&amp;nbsp;K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.&lt;ref name=res/&gt;

Americium is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] in a wide temperature range, from that of [[liquid helium]], to room temperature, and above. This behavior is markedly different from that of its neighbor curium which exhibit antiferromagnetic transition at 52&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanellakopulos|first1=B|title=The magnetic susceptibility of Americium and curium metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=17|page=713|year=1975|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(75)90392-0|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[thermal expansion]] coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5&amp;nbsp;± 0.2){{e|-6}}/°C along the shorter ''a'' axis and (6.2&amp;nbsp;± 0.4){{e|-6}}/°C for the longer ''c'' hexagonal axis.&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt; The [[Enthalpy change of solution|enthalpy of dissolution]] of americium metal in [[hydrochloric acid]] at standard conditions is −620.6&amp;nbsp;± 1.3&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, from which the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)|standard enthalpy change of formation]] (Δ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''H''°) of aqueous Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is −621.2&amp;nbsp;± 2.0&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in [[acid]]s. The most common [[oxidation state]] for americium is +3,&lt;ref name=p4&gt;Penneman, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides and actinides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]], [[iodate]], [[hydroxide]], [[phosphate]] and other salts.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; (yellow), Am&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (brown) and Am&lt;sup&gt;VII&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5-&lt;/sup&gt; (dark green).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie-master.de/FrameHandler.php?loc=http://www.chemie-master.de/pse/pse.php?modul=Am Americium], Das Periodensystem der Elemente für den Schulgebrauch (The periodic table of elements for schools) chemie-master.de (in German), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g1265&gt;Greenwood, p. 1265&lt;/ref&gt; All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amoh4/&gt;&lt;ref name=carbonate/&gt; For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811&amp;nbsp;nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715&amp;nbsp;nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=haxav/&gt;

Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the [[permanganate]] ion (MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) in acidic solutions.&lt;ref name = &quot;HOWI_1956&quot;&gt;Holleman, p. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as [[americium dioxide]] (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and americium(IV) fluoride (AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

Two americium oxides are known, with the oxidation states +3 (Am&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and +4 (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Americium(III) oxide]] is a red-brown solid with a melting point of 2205&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = &quot;HOWI_1972&quot;&gt;Holleman, p. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; [[Americium dioxide|Americium(IV) oxide]] is the main form of solid americium which is used in nearly all its applications. As most other actinide dioxides, it is a black solid with a cubic ([[fluorite]]) crystal structure.&lt;ref name=g1267&gt;Greenwood, p. 1267&lt;/ref&gt;

The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the chemical formula Am&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Americium(III) fluoride (AmF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is poorly soluble and precipitates upon reaction of Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and fluoride ions in weak acidic solutions:

==Fission==

==Isotopes==
{{See also|Isotopes of americium}}
About 19 [[isotope]]s and 8 [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370&amp;nbsp;years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a long half-life of 141&amp;nbsp;years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64&amp;nbsp;microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;245m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am to 50.8&amp;nbsp;hours for &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.&lt;ref name = &quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

[[Americium-241]] decays to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486&amp;nbsp;MeV (85.2%) and 5.443&amp;nbsp;MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit gamma-rays with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://87.139.25.178:81/eng/theory.htm|title=α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Theory - A lecture course on radioactivity|author=Christian Klinck|publisher=University of Technology Kaiserslautern|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americium-242]] is a short-lived isotope with a half-life of 16.02&amp;nbsp;h.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt; It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, but also by [[electron capture]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (17.3%). Both &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu down to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.

Nearly all (99.541%) of &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays by [[internal conversion]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np. The latter breaks down to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and then to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

[[Americium-243]] transforms by α-emission into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, which converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, and the &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu changes into &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U by emitting an α-particle.

===Ionization detectors===
Americium is the only synthetic element to have found its way into the household, where one common type of [[smoke detector]] uses &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.uic.com.au/nip35.htm Smoke Detectors and Americium], Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 35, May 2002. (Internet Archive), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope is preferred against &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[radium|Ra]] because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little of harmful γ-radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 [[Curie|microcurie]] (37&amp;nbsp;[[bequerel|kBq]]) or 0.28 [[microgram]]. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into [[neptunium]]-237, a different [[transuranic element]] with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an [[ionization chamber]], an air-filled space between two [[electrode]]s, and permits a small, constant [[Electric current|current]] between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to [[Type I and type II errors|false alarms]].&lt;ref&gt;Residential Smoke Alarm Performance, Thomas Cleary, Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, UL Smoke and Fire Dynamics Seminar.

As &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a significantly longer half-life than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it has been proposed as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTG&quot;&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L.

Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles.&lt;ref name=rocket&gt;{{cite news|title = Extremely Efficient Nuclear Fuel Could Take Man To Mars In Just Two Weeks|publisher = [[ScienceDaily]]|date = 2001-01-03|url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm|accessdate = 2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title = An americium-fueled gas core nuclear rocket|booktitle = AIP Conf.

One more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am is a nuclear battery. Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining &quot;cathode&quot;. A single 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am charge of such battery could provide about 140&amp;nbsp;kW of power over a period of 80 days.&lt;ref&gt;Genuth, Iddo [http://thefutureofthings.com/articles.php?itemId=26/64/ Americium Power Source], The Future of Things, 3 October 2006, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With all the potential benefits, the current applications of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this [[nuclear isomer]].&lt;ref name=mprice/&gt;

===Neutron source===
The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am pressed with [[beryllium]] is an efficient [[neutron source]]. Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{241\!\,}_{\ 95}Am\ \longrightarrow \ ^{237}_{\ 93}Np\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The most widespread use of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;AmBe neutron sources a [[neutron probe]] – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in [[neutron radiography]], tomography and other radiochemical investigations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;/&gt;

===Production of other elements===
Americium is a starting material for the production of other [[transuranic element]]s and [[transactinide]]s – for example, 82.7% of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 17.3% to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. In the nuclear reactor, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which transforms by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm}&lt;/math&gt;

Irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am by &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne ions yields the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Es ([[einsteinium]]) or &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Db ([[dubnium]]), respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;&gt;Harry H. Binder: ''Lexikon der chemischen Elemente'', S. Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart 1999, ISBN 3-7776-0736-3, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the element [[berkelium]] (&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, [[nobelium]] was produced at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Dubna]], Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for [[lawrencium]], discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.&lt;ref name=g1252/&gt;

===Spectrometer===
Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 60-keV gamma ray emissions from &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in [[radiography]] and [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed [[nuclear density gauge]]s and [[nuclear densometer]]s. For example, the element has been employed to gauge [[glass]] thickness to help create flat glass.&lt;ref name=g1262/&gt; Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/indx_dec.jsp Nuclear Data Viewer 2.4], NNDC&lt;/ref&gt; Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.

==Health issues==
As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=809&amp;tid=158 Public Health Statement for Americium] Section 1.5., Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, April 2004, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

If consumed, americium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, roughly 45% of it goes to the [[liver]] and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] and [[trabecula]]r surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the [[gonad]]s (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-pdf/fs23am241.pdf|author=Division of Environmental Health, Office of Radiation Protection|title=Fact Sheet # 23.

Americium often enters landfills from discarded [[smoke detector]]s. The rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In the U.S., the &quot;Radioactive Boy Scout&quot; [[David Hahn]] was able to concentrate americium from smoke detectors after managing to buy a hundred of them at remainder prices and also stealing a few.&lt;ref name=Silverstein2005&gt;[[Ken Silverstein]], [http://www.harpers.org/archive/1998/11/0059750 The Radioactive Boy Scout: When a teenager attempts to build a breeder reactor].

'''Astatine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|t|ə|ˌ|t|iː|n}} {{respell|AS|tə-teen}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|t|ə|ˌ|t|ɪ|n}} {{respell|AS|tə-tin}}) is a [[radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''At''' and [[atomic number]] 85. It is the heaviest known [[halogen]]. &lt;!-- Note that [[ununseptium]]'s chemical properties are not known, it may not be a halogen. So the sentence is correct, as of 2010--&gt; Astatine is produced by [[radioactive decay]] in nature, but due to its short [[half life]] it is found only in minute amounts. Astatine was first produced by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segrè]] in 1940. Three years passed before traces of astatine were also found in natural minerals. Until recently most of the physical and chemical characteristics of astatine were inferred from comparison with other elements. Some astatine isotopes have been used as [[alpha-particle]] emitters in science, and medical applications for astatine-211 have been tested. Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element, with less than 30&amp;nbsp;grams (1.058 ounces) estimated to be contained in the entire [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;Close, Frank. ''Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press: New York, 2004. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Astatine, a highly [[radioactive]] element, has been confirmed by [[mass spectrometry]] to behave chemically much like other [[halogen]]s, especially [[iodine]] (it would probably accumulate in the [[thyroid]] gland like iodine), though astatine is thought to be more [[metal]]lic than iodine.  Researchers at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] have performed experiments that have identified and measured elementary reactions that involve astatine;&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = C. R. Hammond |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition| publisher =CRC press| isbn = 0-8493-0485-7| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, chemical research into astatine is limited by its extreme rarity, which is a consequence of its extremely short [[half-life]]. Its most stable isotope has a half-life of around 8.3 hours. The final products of the decay of astatine are isotopes of [[lead]]. The halogens get darker in [[color]] with increasing molecular weight and atomic number. Thus, following the trend, astatine would be expected to be a nearly black solid, which, when heated, sublimes into a dark, purplish vapor (darker than iodine).  Astatine is expected to form [[ionic bond]]s with [[metals]] such as [[sodium]], like the other halogens, but it can be displaced from the [[salts]] by lighter, more reactive halogens.  Astatine can also react with [[hydrogen]] to form [[astatane]], which when dissolved in water, forms the exceptionally strong hydroastatic acid.  Astatine is the least reactive of the halogens, being less reactive than iodine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anders&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal =  Annual Review of Nuclear Science | volume =  9 | pages = 203–220 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ns.09.120159.001223 | title = Technetium and Astatine Chemistry | first = E. | last = Anders|bibcode = 1959ARNPS...9..203A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The existence of &quot;eka-iodine&quot; had been predicted by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. Astatine (after [[Greek language|Greek]] αστατος ''astatos'', meaning &quot;unstable&quot;) was first synthesized in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segrè]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by bombarding [[bismuth]] with [[alpha particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the [[periodic table of elements]] was long known, several scientists tried to find the element following iodine in the halogen group. The unknown substance was called Eka-iodine before its discovery because the name of the element was to be suggested by the discoverer. &lt;!-- Several discoveries and therefore several suggested names later proved to be false.--&gt;
The claimed discovery in 1931 at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now [[Auburn University]]) by [[Fred Allison]] and associates, led to the spurious name for the element as ''alabamine'' (Ab) for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evidence of the Detection of Element 85 in Certain Substances| first1 = Fred | last1 =Allison| first2 = Edgar J. | last2 =Murphy| first3 = Edna R. | last3 =Bishop| first4 = Anna L. | last4 =Sommer | journal = Physical Reviews | volume = 37 | pages =  1178–1180 | year = 1931 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.37.1178 | issue = 9 |bibcode = 1931PhRv...37.1178A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743159,00.html

Other erroneous discoveries, and the names selected include the name ''dakin'', proposed in 1937 by the chemist Rajendralal De working in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh (then British India);&lt;ref&gt;[http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=At 85 Astatine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the name helvetium by the Swiss chemist [[Walter Minder]], when he announced the discovery of element 85 in 1940, with his suggested name being changed to anglohelvetium in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Element 85 in the Thorium Family | authorlink1 = Alice Leigh-Smith | first1 = Alice | last1 = Leigh-Smith | authorlink2 = Walter Minder | first2 =  Walter | last2 = Minder | journal = Nature | volume = 150 | pages =  767–768 | year = 1942 | doi = 10.1038/150767a0 | issue = 3817|bibcode = 1942Natur.150..767L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01487965 | title = Über eine vermutete ß-Strahlung des Radium A und die natürliche Existenz des Elementes 85 | year = 1942 | author = Karlik, Berta | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 30 | pages = 685 | last2 = Bernert | first2 = Traude | issue = 44–45|bibcode = 1942NW.....30..685K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ru1968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1070/RC1968v037n02ABEH001603 | title = Astatine | year = 1968 | last1= Nefedov | first1 = V.

It took three years before actual astatine was found as product of the natural decay processes. The short-lived element was found by the two scientists [[Berta Karlik]] and [[Traude Bernert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =  Eine neue natürliche α-Strahlung | last = Karlik | first = Berta | pages = 298–299 |  volume = 31 | issue = 25–26 | year = 1943 | journal = Naturwissenschaften | doi = 10.1007/BF01475613 | last2 =  Bernert | first2 =  Traude|bibcode = 1943NW.....31..298K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =  Das Element 85 in den natürlichen Zerfallsreihen | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 123 | issue = 1–2  | year = 1943 | doi = 10.1007/BF01375144 | pages = 51–72 | last = Karlik | first = Berta | last2 =  Bernert | first2 =  Trande |bibcode = 1943ZPhy..123...51K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Astatine occurs naturally in three natural [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[Decay chain|decay series]], but because of its short [[half-life]] is found only in minute amounts. Astatine-218 (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;At) is found in the [[Decay chain#Radium_series_.28aka_Uranium_series.29|uranium series]] and &lt;sup&gt;215&lt;/sup&gt;At as well as &lt;sup&gt;219&lt;/sup&gt;At are in the [[Decay chain#Actinium_series|actinium series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = astatine (At) | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopedia Britannica]] online | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009963/astatine | accessdate = 2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most long-lived of these naturally occurring astatine isotopes is &lt;sup&gt;219&lt;/sup&gt;At with a half-life of 56 seconds.

Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element, with the total amount in Earth's crust estimated to be less than 1 [[ounce|oz]] (28 g) at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records]]'' has dubbed the element the rarest on Earth, stating: &quot;Only around 0.9 oz (25 [[gram|g]]) of the element astatine (At) occurs naturally&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This amounts to less than one teaspoon of the element.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  [[Isaac Asimov]], in a [[Only a Trillion|1957 essay]] on [[large numbers]], [[scientific notation]], and the size of the atom, wrote that in &quot;all of North and South America to a depth of ten miles&quot;, the number of astatine-215 atoms at any time is &quot;only a [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=Pr-4AAAAIAAJ | title = Only a trillion| first = Isaac | last = Asimov | authorlink = Isaac Asimov | publisher = Abelard-Schuman  | year = 1957 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===

Astatine is produced by bombarding [[bismuth]] with energetic [[alpha particles]] to obtain the relatively long-lived isotopes &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;At through &lt;sup&gt;211&lt;/sup&gt;At, which can then be [[distillation|distilled]] from the target by heating in the presence of air. The energy of the alpha particles determine which isotopes are produced:

== Compounds ==
Multiple [[chemical compound|compounds]] of astatine have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their inevitable radioactive disintegration. The reactions are normally tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. The iodine acts as a carrier, ensuring that there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques such as filtration and precipitation to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ru1968&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal =Analyst| year = 1952| volume = 77 | pages = 774–777|  doi =  10.1039/AN9527700774  | title = Section 5: radiochemical methods.

While these compounds are primarily of theoretical interest, they are being studied for potential use in [[nuclear medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/80581.php | title = Nuclear Nanocapsules, The New Cancer Weapon | date =1007-08-27 | first = Jade | last = Boyd  | publisher = Medical News Today | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astatine is expected to form [[ionic bond]]s with [[metals]] such as [[sodium]], like the other halogens, but it can be displaced from the [[salts]] by lighter, more reactive halogens.  Astatine can also react with [[hydrogen]] to form [[hydrogen astatide]] (HAt), which, when dissolved in water, forms hydroastatic acid.

Some examples of astatic compounds are

== Isotopes ==
{{main|Isotopes of astatine}}
Astatine has 33 known [[isotope]]s, all of which are [[radioactive]]; the range of their mass numbers is from 191 to 223. There exist also 23 [[metastable]] [[excited state]]s. The longest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;At, which has a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours; the shortest-lived known isotope is &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;At, which has a half-life of 125 [[nanoseconds]].&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Audi | first = Georges  | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties  | journal = Nuclear Physics A  | volume = 729  | pages = 3–128 | publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center  | year = 2003 | doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The least stable isotopes of astatine have no practical applications other than scientific study due to their extremely short life, but heavier isotopes have medical uses. Astatine-211 is an alpha emitter with a physical half-life of 7.2 h. These features have led to its use in [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal Nuclear Medicine | title = Overcoming the Obstacles to Clinical Evaluation of 211At-Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals | first = D.

By comparison, [[beta particle|beta]]-emitting [[phosphorus-32]] as colloidal chromic phosphate had no antineoplastic activity. The most compelling explanation for this striking difference is the dense ionization and short range of action associated with alpha-emission. These results have important implications for the development and use of alpha-emitters as radiocolloid therapy for the treatment of human tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | year = 1981 | volume = 212 | issue = 4492 | pages = 340–341 | doi = 10.1126/science.7209534 | title = Astatine-211--tellurium radiocolloid cures experimental malignant ascites | last = Bloomer | first = W.

== Precautions ==

Since astatine is extremely radioactive, it should be handled with extreme care.  Because of its extreme rarity, it is not likely that the general public will be exposed.

Astatine is a halogen, and standard precautions apply.  It is reactive, sharing similar chemical characteristics with iodine.

There are toxicologic studies of astatine-211 on mice indicating that [[radioactive poisoning]] is the major effect on living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/096032718800700602 | title = Toxicity of Astatine-211 in the Mouse | year = 1988 | author = Cobb, L.M. | journal = Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology | volume = 7 | pages = 529 | last2 = Harrison | first2 = A. | last3 = Butler | first3 = S.A. | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox atom}}
The '''atom''' is a basic unit of [[matter]] that consists of a dense, central [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by a [[electron cloud|cloud]] of [[electric charge|negatively charged]] [[electrons]]. The [[atomic nucleus]] contains a mix of positively charged [[proton]]s and electrically neutral [[neutron]]s (except in the case of [[hydrogen-1]], which is the only stable [[nuclide]] with no neutrons). The electrons of an atom are bound to the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. Likewise, a group of atoms can remain bound to each other, forming a [[molecule]]. An atom containing an equal number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral, otherwise it has a positive charge ([[electron deficiency]]) or negative charge (electron excess) and is an [[ion]]. An atom is [[Periodic table|classified]] according to the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus: the [[atomic number|number of protons]] determines the [[chemical element]], and the [[neutron number|number of neutrons]] determines the [[isotope]] of the element.&lt;ref name=leigh1990/&gt;

The name atom comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;ἄτομος&quot;—''átomos'' (from α-, &quot;un-&quot; + τέμνω – ''temno'', &quot;to cut&quot;&lt;ref name=liddell_scott_to_cut/&gt;), which means uncuttable, or indivisible, something that cannot be divided further.&lt;ref name=liddell_scott_uncuttable/&gt; The concept of an atom as an indivisible component of matter was first proposed by early [[Indian philosophy|India]]n and [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosophers. In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[chemist]]s provided a physical basis for this idea by showing that certain substances could not be further broken down by chemical methods. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[physicist]]s discovered subatomic components and structure inside the atom, thereby demonstrating that the 'atom' was divisible. The principles of [[quantum mechanics]] were used to successfully [[Scientific modelling|model]] the atom.&lt;ref name=haubold_mathai1998/&gt;{{sfn|Harrison|2003|pp=123–139}}

Atoms are minuscule objects with proportionately tiny masses. Atoms can only be observed individually using special instruments such as the [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. Over 99.9% of an atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Most isotopes have more nucleons than electrons. In the case of hydrogen-1, with a single electron and nucleon, the proton is &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}\frac{1836}{1837} \approx 0.9995\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, or 99.95% of the total atomic mass.&lt;/ref&gt; with protons and neutrons having roughly equal mass. Each element has at least one isotope with unstable nuclei that can undergo [[radioactive decay]]. This can result in a [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] that changes the number of protons or neutrons in a nucleus.&lt;ref name=slac_20090615/&gt; Electrons that are bound to atoms possess a set of stable [[energy level]]s, or [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]], and can undergo transitions between them by absorbing or emitting [[photon]]s that match the energy differences between the levels. The electrons determine the chemical properties of an element, and strongly influence an atom's [[Magnetism|magnetic]] properties.

==History==
{{Main|Atomic theory}}

===Atomism===
{{Main|Atomism}}
The concept that matter is composed of [[wikt:discrete|discrete]] units and cannot be divided into arbitrarily tiny quantities has been around for [[millennia]], but these ideas were founded in abstract, philosophical reasoning rather than [[experiment]]ation and [[Empirical|empirical observation]]. The nature of atoms in philosophy varied considerably over time and between cultures and schools, and often had spiritual elements. Nevertheless, the basic idea of the atom was adopted by scientists thousands of years later because it elegantly explained new discoveries in the field of chemistry.{{sfn|Ponomarev|1993|pp=14–15}}

References to the concept of atoms date back to ancient [[History of Greece|Greece]] and [[History of India|India]]. In India, the [[Ājīvika]], [[Jain]], and [[Cārvāka]] schools of atomism may date back to the 6th century BCE.{{sfn|McEvilley|2002|p=317}} The [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools later developed theories on how atoms combined into more complex objects.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=105–107}} In the West, the references to atoms emerged in the 5th century BCE with [[Leucippus]], whose student, [[Democritus]], systematized his views. In approximately 450&amp;nbsp;BCE, Democritus coined the term ''átomos'' ({{lang-el|ἄτομος}}), which means &quot;uncuttable&quot; or &quot;the smallest indivisible particle of matter&quot;. Although the [[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian]] and [[Atomism#Greek atomism|Greek concepts]] of the atom were based purely on philosophy, modern science has retained the name coined by Democritus.{{sfn|Ponomarev|1993|pp=14–15}}

[[Corpuscularianism]] is the postulate, expounded 
in the 13th-century by the [[alchemy|alchemist]] [[Pseudo-Geber]] (Geber),{{sfn|Moran|2005|p=146}} sometimes identified with [[Paul of Taranto]], that all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles.{{sfn|Levere|2001|p=7}} Corpuscularianism is similar (this is the electrical pulses ) to the theory atomism, except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be divided. In this manner, for example, it was theorized that [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure.&lt;ref name=pratt20070928/&gt; Corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory over the next several hundred years. 

In 1661, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Robert Boyle]] published ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'' in which he argued that matter was composed of various combinations of different &quot;corpuscules&quot; or atoms, rather than the [[classical element]]s of air, earth, fire and water.{{sfn|Siegfried|2002|pp=42–55}} During the 1670s was used by [[Isaac Newton]] in his development of the [[corpuscular theory of light]].{{sfn|Levere|2001|p=7}}&lt;ref name=kemerling20020808/&gt;

===Origin of scientific theory===
[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|right|thumb|Various atoms and molecules as depicted in [[John Dalton]]'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808), one of the earliest scientific works on atomic theory.]]
Further progress in the understanding of atoms did not occur until the science of [[chemistry]] began to develop. In 1789, French nobleman and scientific researcher [[Antoine Lavoisier]] discovered the [[law of conservation of mass]] and defined an [[Chemical element|element]] as a basic substance that could not be further broken down by the methods of chemistry.&lt;ref name=lavoisier_eoc/&gt;

In 1805, English instructor and natural philosopher [[John Dalton]] used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small [[Natural number|whole number]]s (the [[law of multiple proportions]]) and why certain gases dissolve better in water than others. He proposed that each element consists of atoms of a single, unique type, and that these atoms can join together to form chemical compounds.{{sfn|Wurtz|1881|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Dalton|1808}} Dalton is considered the originator of modern [[atomic theory]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1895|pp=129}}

Dalton's atomic hypothesis did not specify the size of atoms.  Common sense indicated they must be very small, but nobody knew how small.  Therefore it was a major landmark when in 1865 [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] measured the size of the molecules that make up air. 

An additional line of reasoning in support of particle theory (and by extension [[atomic theory]]) began in 1827 when [[Botany|botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] used a [[microscope]] to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically—a phenomenon that became known as &quot;[[Brownian motion]]&quot;. J. Desaulx suggested in 1877 that the phenomenon was caused by the thermal motion of water molecules, and in 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] produced the first mathematical analysis of the motion.&lt;ref name=adp322_8_549/&gt;{{sfn|Mazo|2002|pp=1–7}}&lt;ref name=lee_hoon1995/&gt; French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory.&lt;ref name=e31_2_50/&gt;

[[File:Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table.png|thumb|left|[[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev's]] first periodic table (1869).]]
In 1869, building upon earlier discoveries by such scientists as Lavoisier, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first functional [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=pte20071101/&gt; The table itself is a visual representation of the periodic law, which states that certain chemical properties of [[chemical element|element]]s repeat ''periodically'' when arranged by [[atomic number]].{{sfn|Scerri|2007|pp=10–17}}

===Subcomponents and quantum theory===

The physicist [[J. J. Thomson]], through his work on [[cathode ray]]s in 1897, discovered the electron, and concluded that they were a component of every atom. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.&lt;ref name=nobel1096/&gt; Thomson postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom, possibly rotating in rings, with their charge balanced by the presence of a uniform sea of positive charge. This later became known as the [[plum pudding model]]. 

In 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], under the direction of physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]], bombarded a sheet of gold foil with [[alpha particle|alpha rays]]—by then known to be positively charged helium atoms—and discovered that a small percentage of these particles were deflected through much larger angles than was predicted using Thomson's proposal. Rutherford interpreted the [[gold foil experiment]] as suggesting that the positive charge of a heavy gold atom and most of its mass was concentrated in a nucleus at the center of the atom—the [[Rutherford model]].&lt;ref name=pm21_669/&gt;

While experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.&lt;ref name=npc1921/&gt; The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s.&lt;ref name=prsA_89_1_1913/&gt;

[[File:Bohr Model.svg|right|thumb|A [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom, showing an electron jumping between fixed orbits and emitting a [[photon]] of energy with a specific frequency.]]

Meanwhile, in 1913, physicist [[Niels Bohr]] suggested that the electrons were confined into clearly defined, quantized orbits, and could jump between these, but could not freely spiral inward or outward in intermediate states.&lt;ref name=stern20050516/&gt; An electron must absorb or emit specific amounts of energy to transition between these fixed orbits. When the [[light]] from a heated material was passed through a [[Prism (optics)|prism]], it produced a multi-colored [[spectrum]]. The appearance of fixed [[Spectral line|lines in this spectrum]] was successfully explained by these orbital transitions.&lt;ref name=bohr19221211/&gt;

[[Chemical bond]]s between atoms were now explained, by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.&lt;ref name=jacs38_4_762/&gt; As the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the [[periodic law]],{{sfn|Scerri|2007|pp=205–226}} in 1919 the American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of [[electron shell]]s about the nucleus.&lt;ref name=jacs41_6_868/&gt;

The [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.&lt;ref name=fop17_6_575/&gt;

In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves. In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional [[waveform]]s rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the [[Point (geometry)|position]] and [[momentum]] of a particle at the same time; this became known as the [[uncertainty principle]], formulated by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa. This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and [[Spectral line|spectral]] patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [[atomic orbital]] zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.&lt;ref name=brown2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison2000/&gt;

[[File:Mass Spectrometer Schematic.svg|left|thumb|Schematic diagram of a simple mass spectrometer.]]
The development of the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] allowed the exact mass of atoms to be measured. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist [[Francis William Aston]] used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The [[atomic mass]] of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the [[whole number rule]].&lt;ref name=pm39_6_449/&gt; The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the [[neutron]], a neutral-charged particle with a mass similar to the [[proton]], by the physicist [[James Chadwick]] in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.&lt;ref name=chadwick1935/&gt;

===Fission, high energy physics and condensed matter===

In 1938, the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get [[transuranium element]]s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed [[barium]] as a product.&lt;ref name=hahn_meitner_strassmann/&gt; A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''.&lt;ref name=nature143_3615_239/&gt;&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt; In 1944, Hahn received the [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.&lt;ref name=pt50_9_26/&gt;

In the 1950s, the development of improved [[particle accelerator]]s and [[particle detector]]s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.&lt;ref name=kullander2001/&gt; Neutrons and protons were found to be [[hadron]]s, or composites of smaller particles called [[quark]]s. Standard models of nuclear physics were developed that successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.&lt;ref name=npp1990/&gt;

==Components==
===Subatomic particles===
{{Main|Subatomic particle}}
Though the word ''atom'' originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various [[subatomic particle]]s. The constituent particles of an atom are the [[electron]], the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]. However, the [[hydrogen|hydrogen-1]] atom has no neutrons and a positive [[hydrogen ion]] has no electrons.

The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at {{val|9.11|e=-31|u=kg}}, with a negative [[Electric charge|electrical charge]] and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.{{sfn|Demtröder|2002|pp=39–42}} Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at {{val|1.6726|e=-27|u=kg}}, although this can be reduced by changes to the [[binding energy|energy binding]] the proton into an atom. Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of electrons,{{sfn|Woan|2000|p=8}} or {{val|1.6929|e=-27|u=kg}}. Neutrons and protons have comparable dimensions—on the order of {{val|2.5|e=-15|u=m}}—although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.{{sfn|MacGregor|1992|pp=33–37}}

In the [[Standard Model]] of physics, both protons and neutrons are composed of [[elementary particle]]s called [[quark]]s. The quark belongs to the [[fermion]] group of particles, and is one of the two basic constituents of matter—the other being the [[lepton]], of which the electron is an example. There are six types of quarks, each having a fractional electric charge of either +{{frac|2|3}} or −{{frac|3}}. Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], while a neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles. The quarks are held together by the [[strong nuclear force]], which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. The gluon is a member of the family of [[gauge boson|gauge]] [[boson]]s, which are elementary particles that mediate physical [[force]]s.&lt;ref name=pdg2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=schombert2006/&gt;

===Nucleus===
{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|350px|The [[binding energy]] needed for a nucleon to escape the nucleus, for various isotopes.]]&lt;!-- A brief explanation is provided here because 'binding energy' is not explained until the end of the setion. --&gt;

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny [[atomic nucleus]], and are collectively called [[nucleon]]s. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1.07 \sqrt[3]{A} \text{ fm}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where ''A'' is the total number of nucleons.{{sfn|Jevremovic|2005|p=63}} This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the [[residual strong force]]. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the [[electrostatic force]] that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.{{sfn|Pfeffer|2000|pp=330–336}}

Atoms of the same [[chemical element|element]] have the same number of protons, called the [[atomic number]]. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the [[nuclide]]. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing [[radioactive decay]].&lt;ref name=wenner2007/&gt;

The neutron and the proton are different types of [[fermion]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect that prohibits ''identical'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum physical state at the same time. Thus every proton in the nucleus must occupy a different state, with its own energy level, and the same rule applies to all of the neutrons. This prohibition does not apply to a proton and neutron occupying the same quantum state.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot;/&gt;

For atoms with low atomic numbers, a nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with roughly matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which modifies this trend. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium); and as Z increases toward the heaviest nuclei, the ratio of neutrons per proton required for stability increases to about 1.5.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons. A [[positron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—an [[antimatter]] electron—is emitted along with an electron [[neutrino]].]]

The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. [[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the [[coulomb barrier]]—and
fuse together into a single nucleus.&lt;ref name=mihos2002/&gt; [[Nuclear fission]] is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.&lt;ref name=lbnl20070330/&gt;&lt;ref name=makhijani_saleska2001/&gt;

If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [[gamma ray]], or the kinetic energy of a [[beta particle]]), as described by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass loss and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This deficit is part of the [[binding energy]] of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.{{sfn|Shultis|Faw|2002|pp=10–17}}

The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than [[iron]] and [[nickel]]—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.&lt;ref name=ajp63_7_653/&gt; It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in [[star]]s a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per [[nucleon]] in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and [[atomic mass]]es higher than about 60, is an [[endothermic reaction|endothermic process]]. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of a star.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot;/&gt;

===Electron cloud===
{{Main|Atomic orbital|Electron configuration}}

[[File:Potential energy well.svg|right|thumb|A potential well, showing, according to [[classical mechanics]], the minimum energy ''V''(''x'') needed to reach each position ''x''. Classically, a particle with energy ''E'' is constrained to a range of positions between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.

Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave–particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [[atomic orbital]], a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.&lt;ref name=science157_3784_13/&gt; Only a discrete (or [[wikt:quantize|quantize]]d) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.&lt;ref name=Brucat2008/&gt; Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and they differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.&lt;ref name=manthey2001/&gt;

[[File:S-p-Orbitals.svg|left|thumb|Wave functions of the first five atomic orbitals. The three 2p orbitals each display a single angular [[Node (physics)|node]] that has an orientation and a minimum at the center.]]

Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular [[energy level]] of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [[atomic spectral line]]s.&lt;ref name=Brucat2008/&gt;

The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the [[electron binding energy]]—is far less than the [[binding energy|binding energy of nucleons]]. For example, it requires only 13.6&amp;nbsp;eV to strip a [[Stationary state|ground-state]] electron from a hydrogen atom,&lt;ref name=herter_8/&gt; compared to 2.23&amp;nbsp;''million'' eV for splitting a [[deuterium]] nucleus.&lt;ref name=pr79_2_282/&gt; Atoms are [[electric charge|electrically]] neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ion]]s. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to [[chemical bond|bond]] into [[molecule]]s and other types of [[chemical compound]]s like [[Ionic crystal|ionic]] and [[Covalent bond|covalent]] network [[Crystallization|crystals]].{{sfn|Smirnov|2003|pp=249–272}}

==Properties==
===Nuclear properties===
{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope|List of nuclides|List of elements by stability of isotopes}}

By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of ''protons'' in their nuclei belong to the same [[chemical element]]. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of ''neutrons'' are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons [[hydrogen atom|hydrogen-1]], one neutron ([[deuterium]]), two neutrons ([[tritium]]) and [[isotopes of hydrogen|more than two neutrons]]. The hydrogen-1 is by far the most common form, and is sometimes called protium.&lt;ref name=matis2000/&gt; The known elements form a set of atomic numbers from hydrogen with a single proton up to the 118-proton element [[ununoctium]].&lt;ref name=weiss20061017/&gt; All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive.{{sfn|Sills|2003|pp=131–134}}&lt;ref name=dume20030423/&gt;

About 339 nuclides occur naturally on [[Earth]],&lt;ref name=lidsay20000730/&gt; of which 255 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as &quot;[[stable isotope]]s&quot;. However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even [[list of nuclides|in theory]]. Another 165 (bringing the total to 255) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as &quot;stable&quot;. An additional 33 radioactive nuclides have half lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the [[solar system]]. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as [[primordial nuclide]]s. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as [[radium]] from [[uranium]]), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).&lt;ref name=tuli2005/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For more recent updates see [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart Interactive Chart of Nuclides (Brookhaven National Laboratory)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- See article [[list of nuclides]]. The numbers are derived by [[WP:CALC]] (counting the table), which is not [[WP:OR]]--&gt;

For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one [[stable isotope]] exists. Elements [[technetium|43]], [[promethium|61]], and all elements numbered [[bismuth|83]] or higher have no stable isotopes. As a rule, there is, for each element, only a handful of stable isotopes, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element among those that have stable isotopes. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element [[tin]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;CRC Handbook (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain &quot;magic numbers&quot; of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 255 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons ''and'' odd number of neutrons: [[hydrogen-2]] ([[deuterium]]), [[lithium-6]], [[boron-10]] and [[nitrogen-14]]. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd-odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: [[potassium-40]], [[vanadium-50]], [[lanthanum-138]] and [[tantalum-180m]]. Most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

===Mass===
{{Main|Atomic mass}}

The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons, the total number of these particles in an atom is called the [[mass number]]. The [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed using the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]] (u), which is also called a Dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [[carbon-12]], which is approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.&lt;ref name=iupac/&gt; [[hydrogen atom|Hydrogen-1]], the lightest isotope of hydrogen and the atom with the lowest mass, has an atomic weight of 1.007825&amp;nbsp;u.&lt;ref name=chieh2001/&gt; An atom has a mass approximately equal to the mass number times the atomic mass unit.&lt;ref name=nist_wc/&gt; The heaviest [[stable atom]] is lead-208,{{sfn|Sills|2003|pp=131–134}} with a mass of {{val|207.9766521|u=u}}.&lt;ref name=audi2003/&gt; 

As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s. The mole is defined such that one mole of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]]). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1&amp;nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]], [[carbon]] has an atomic mass of ''exactly'' 12&amp;nbsp;u, and so a mole of carbon atoms weighs exactly 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;Mills ''et al.'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

===Shape and size===
{{Main|Atomic radius}}
Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [[atomic radius]]. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a [[chemical bond]]. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms ([[coordination number]]) and a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref name=aca32_5_751/&gt; On the [[periodic table]] of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).&lt;ref name=dong1998/&gt; Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32&amp;nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]], while one of the largest is [[caesium]] at 225&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Zumdahl (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

When subjected to external fields, like an [[electrical field]], the shape of an atom may deviate from that of a sphere. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by [[group theory|group-theoretical]] considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in [[crystal]]s, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at [[crystal symmetry|low-symmetry]] lattice sites.&lt;ref name=adp5f_3_133/&gt; Significant [[ellipsoid]]al deformations have recently been shown to occur for sulfur ions in [[pyrite]]-type compounds. &lt;ref name=pssb245_9_1858/&gt;

Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of [[light]] (400–700&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) so they can not be viewed using an [[optical microscope]]. However, individual atoms can be observed using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1&amp;nbsp;million carbon atoms in width.&lt;ref name=osu2007/&gt; A single drop of water contains about 2&amp;nbsp;[[sextillion]] ({{val|2|e=21}}) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Padilla ''et al.'' (2002:32)—&quot;There are 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's 2&amp;nbsp;sextillion) atoms of oxygen in one drop of water—and twice as many atoms of hydrogen.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A single [[Carat (unit)|carat]] [[diamond]] with a mass of {{val|2|e=-4|u=kg}} contains about 10&amp;nbsp;sextillion (10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) atoms of [[carbon]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;A carat is 200&amp;nbsp;milligrams. [[Atomic mass|By definition]], carbon-12 has 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg per mole. The [[Avogadro constant]] defines {{val|6|e=23}} atoms per mole.&lt;/ref&gt; If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.{{sfn|Feynman|1995|p=5}}

===Radioactive decay===
{{Main|Radioactive decay}}

[[File:Isotopes and half-life.svg|right|300px|thumb|This diagram shows the [[half-life]] (T&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt;) of various isotopes with Z protons and N neutrons.]]

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;fm.&lt;ref name=splung/&gt;

The most common forms of radioactive decay are:{{sfn|L'Annunziata|2003|pp=3–56}}&lt;ref name=firestone20000522/&gt;
*[[Alpha decay]] is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]].
*[[Beta decay]] is regulated by the [[weak force]], and results from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The first is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while the second causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one.
*[[Gamma decay]] results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. This can occur following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle from radioactive decay.

Other more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]], or result (through [[internal conversion]]) in production of high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, and high-energy photons that are not gamma rays.

Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the [[half-life]]—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.&lt;ref name=splung/&gt;

===Magnetic moment===
{{Main|Electron magnetic dipole moment|Nuclear magnetic moment}}

Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½&amp;nbsp;ħ, or &quot;spin-½&quot;. In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.&lt;ref name=hornak2006/&gt;

The [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom—its [[magnetic moment]]—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt;

In [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=goebel20070901/&gt;

The nucleus of an atom can also have a net spin. Normally these nuclei are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]]. This has important applications in [[magnetic resonance imaging]].&lt;ref name=yarris1997/&gt;{{sfn|Liang|Haacke|1999|pp=412–426}}

===Energy levels===
{{Main|Energy level|Atomic spectral line}}

When an electron is bound to an atom, it has a [[potential energy]] that is inversely proportional to its distance from the nucleus. This is measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV). In the quantum mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level. The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, while an electron at a higher energy level is in an excited state.&lt;ref name=zeghbroeck1998/&gt;

For an electron to transition between two different states, it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels. The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowles (1989:227–233).&lt;/ref&gt; Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.&lt;ref name=martin2007/&gt;

[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|300px|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum.]]

When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[Spectral line|emission lines]] from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.&lt;ref name=avogadro/&gt;

Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display
a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of
[[spin-orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the
spin and motion of the outermost electron.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/&gt; When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.&lt;ref name=weiss2001/&gt; The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]].{{sfn|Beyer|2003|pp=232–236}}

If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [[stimulated emission]] of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [[laser]]s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.&lt;ref name=watkins_sjsu/&gt;

===Valence and bonding behavior===
{{Main|Valence (chemistry)|Chemical bond}}

The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell, and the electrons in
that shell are called [[valence electron]]s. The number of valence electrons determines the [[chemical bond|bonding]]
behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [[Chemical reaction|chemically react]] with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.&lt;ref name=reusch20070716/&gt; For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [[sodium chloride]] and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [[chemical bond]]ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [[organic compounds]].&lt;ref name=chemguide/&gt;

The [[chemical element]]s are often displayed in a [[periodic table]] that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=husted20031211/&gt;&lt;ref name=baum2003/&gt;

[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Snapshots illustrating the formation of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].]]
Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es and [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]].
{{sfn|Goodstein|2002|pp=436–438}} Within a state, a material can also exist in different phases. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as [[graphite]] or [[diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Surface reconstruction|Reconstruction]] causes the surface atoms to deviate from the bulk [[crystal structure]] and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them.]]
The [[scanning tunneling microscope]] is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the [[quantum tunneling]] phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an [[adsorb]]ed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the [[Fermi level]] [[local density of states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An atom can be [[ion]]ized by removing one of its electrons. The [[electric charge]] causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a [[magnetic field]]. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] uses this principle to measure the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]] and [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]], both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A more area-selective method is [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]], which measures the energy loss of an [[electron beam]] within a [[transmission electron microscope]] when it interacts with a portion of a sample.

Each particle of matter has a corresponding [[antimatter]] particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the [[positron]] is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. (The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although the [[baryogenesis]] theories may offer an explanation.)

In [[geography]], '''arable land''' (from [[Latin]] ''arare'', to [[plough]]) is an [[agriculture|agricultural]] term, meaning [[land (economics)|land]] that can be used for growing [[agriculture|crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for arable land are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-standards/ess-production-definitions0/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As such, it has to be distinguished from &quot;agricultural land&quot;, which, according to FAO definition, additionally includes land under permanent crops as well as permanent pastures.
In 2008, the world's total arable land amounted to 13'805'153&amp;nbsp;km², whereas 48'836'976&amp;nbsp;km²
was classified as &quot;agricultural land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010-reources/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although constrained by land mass and topology, the amount of arable land, both regionally and globally, fluctuates due to human and climatic factors such as irrigation, deforestation, desertification, terracing, landfill, and urban sprawl. Researchers study the impact of these changes on food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4683E/y4683e06.htm |title=y4683e06 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncapsa.org/Flash_Detail.asp?VJournalKey=73 |title=CAPSA Flash Detail |publisher=Uncapsa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most productive portion of arable land is that from sediments left by rivers and the sea in geological times. In modern times, rivers do not generally flood as often in areas employing [[flood control]].

==Non-arable land==
[[Image:Arable land percent world.png|thumb|300px|Map of world percentage arable land.]]
Land which is unsuitable for arable farming usually has at least one of the following deficiencies: no source of fresh water; too hot (desert); too cold (Arctic); too rocky; too mountainous; too salty; too rainy; too snowy; too polluted; or too nutrient poor. Clouds may block the sunlight plants need for [[photosynthesis]], reducing productivity. Plants can starve without light. [[Starvation]] and [[nomad]]ism often exists on marginally arable land. Non-arable land is sometimes called ''wasteland'', ''badlands'', ''worthless'' or ''no man's land''.

However, non-arable land can sometimes be converted into arable land. New arable land makes more food, and can reduce [[starvation]]. This outcome also makes a country more [[self-sufficient]] and politically independent, because food importation is reduced. Making non-arable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells, aqueducts, [[desalination]] plants, planting trees for shade in the desert, [[hydroponic]]s, fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, [[pesticide]]s, [[reverse osmosis]] water processors, [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] insulation or other insulation against heat and cold, digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind, and greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas. This process is often extremely expensive.

Some examples of infertile '''non-arable''' land being turned into fertile '''arable''' land are:
* [[Aran Islands]]: These islands off the west coast of Ireland, (not to be confused with the [[Isle of Arran]] in Scotland's [[Firth of Clyde]]), were unsuitable for arable farming because they were too rocky. The people covered the islands with a shallow layer of seaweed and sand from the ocean. This made it arable. Today, crops are grown there.
* [[Israel]]: Israel's land primarily consisted of desert until the construction of [[desalination]] plants along the country's coast. The desalination plants, which remove the salt from ocean water, have created a new source of water for farming, drinking, and washing.
* [[Slash and burn]] agriculture uses nutrients in wood ash, but these expire within a few years.
* [[Terra preta]], fertile tropical soils created by adding charcoal.

Some examples of fertile '''arable''' land being turned into infertile land are:
* Droughts like the '[[dust bowl]]' of the [[Great Depression]] in the U.S. turned farmland into desert.
* [[Rainforest]] Deforestation: The fertile tropical forests turn into infertile desert land. For example, [[Madagascar]]'s central highland plateau has become virtually totally barren (about ten percent of the country), as a result of [[slash-and-burn]] [[illegal logging in Madagascar|deforestation]], an element of [[shifting cultivation]] practiced by many natives.
* Each year, arable land is lost to desertification and [[erosion]] from human industrial activities. Improper irrigation of farm land can wick the [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] from the soil and water to the surface. This process steadily concentrates salt in the root zone, decreasing productivity for crops that are not salt-tolerant.
* [[Urban sprawl]]: In the United States, {{convert|8900|km2|acres|abbr=on}} of land was added to urban areas between 1992 and 2003.

&lt;!--SPELLING OF '''ALUMINUM''' - Please see the talk page, this article is written using the IUPAC spelling of &quot;aluminium&quot; and so 'ium' should be used. The article follows [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Element names]] for conventions on chemical names, so &quot;sulfur&quot;, etc. should be maintained.--&gt;{{Infobox aluminium}}
'''Aluminium''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|En-uk-aluminium1.ogg|ˌ|æ|l|j|ʉ|ˈ|m|ɪ|n|i|əm}} {{respell|AL|ew|MIN|ee-əm}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howjsay.com/index.php?word=aluminium |title=Pronunciation of aluminium – how to pronounce aluminium correctly |publisher=Howjsay.com |date=2006-10-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''aluminum''' ({{IPAc-en|US|En-us-aluminum.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|uː|m|ɨ|n|əm}} {{respell|ə|LOO|mi-nəm}}) is a silvery white member of the [[boron group]] of [[chemical element]]s. It has the symbol '''Al''' and its [[atomic number]] is 13. It is not soluble in water under normal circumstances.
Aluminium is the [[element abundance|most abundant metal]] in the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]], and the third most abundant element, after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface. Aluminium is too reactive chemically to occur in nature as a free metal. Instead, it is found combined in over 270&amp;nbsp;different [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Science is Fun|author = Shakhashiri, Bassam Z. |url = http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/chemweek/Aluminum/ALUMINUM.html|title = Chemical of the Week: Aluminum|accessdate = 2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief source of aluminium is [[bauxite]] [[ore]].

Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low [[density]] and for its ability to resist [[corrosion]] due to the phenomenon of [[passivation]]. Structural components made from aluminium and its [[aluminium alloy|alloys]] are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry and are very important in other areas of [[transport]]ation and building. Its reactive nature makes it useful as a [[catalyst]] or additive in chemical mixtures, including [[ammonium nitrate]] [[explosives]], to enhance blast power.

Despite its prevalence in the environment, aluminium salts are not known to be used by any form of life. Also in keeping with the element's abundance, it is well tolerated{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} by plants in soils (in which it is a major component), and to a lesser extent, by animals as a component of plant materials in the diet (which often contain traces of dust and soil). Soluble aluminium salts have some demonstrated toxicity to animals if delivered in quantity by unnatural routes, such as injection. Controversy still exists about aluminium's possible long-term [[toxicity]] to humans from larger ingested amounts.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Aluminium bar surface etched.jpg|thumb|left|Etched surface from a high purity (99.9998%) aluminium bar, size 55×37 mm]]
Aluminium is a soft, durable, lightweight, [[ductility|ductile]] and [[malleable]] [[metal]] with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. Aluminium is nonmagnetic and nonsparking{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}. It is also insoluble in alcohol, though it can be soluble in water in certain forms. The [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of pure aluminium is 7–11 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], while [[aluminium alloy]]s have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.&lt;ref name=&quot;polmear&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Light Alloys: Metallurgy of the Light Metals|author = Polmear, I. J.|publisher = Arnold |year = 1995 |isbn = 9780340632079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium has about one-third the [[density]] and [[Elastic modulus|stiffness]] of [[steel]]. It is easily [[machining|machined]], [[casting (metalworking)|cast]], [[drawing (metalworking)|drawn]] and [[extrusion|extruded]].

[[Corrosion]] resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of [[aluminium oxide]] that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further [[oxidation]]. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions with alloyed [[copper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;polmear&quot; /&gt; This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced when many aqueous salts are present, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

Aluminium atoms are arranged in a [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure. Aluminium has a [[stacking-fault energy]] of approximately 200 mJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dieter G. E.|title=Mechanical Metallurgy|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1988|isbn=0070168938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium is one of the few metals that retain full silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [[silver (color)|silver-colored]] paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest [[reflectance]] of any metal in the 200–400&amp;nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet|UV]]) and the 3,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;nm (far [[infrared|IR]]) regions; in the 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by [[tin]] and [[silver]] and in the 700–3000 (near IR) by silver, [[gold]], and copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Thin-film optical filters| author = Macleod, H. A.|publisher = CRC Press| year = 2001| isbn =0750306882| pages = 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium is a good [[Heat conduction|thermal]] and [[electrical conductor]], having 59% the conductivity of copper, both thermal and electrical. Aluminium is capable of being a [[superconductor]], with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [[Kelvin]] and a critical magnetic field of about 100 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (10 [[millitesla]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cochran, John F. and Mapother, D. E. |title=Superconducting Transition in Aluminum |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.111.132| journal=Physical Review |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=132–142| year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Stable aluminium is created when [[hydrogen]] fuses with [[magnesium]] either in large stars or in [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cameron, A.G.W. |title=Stellar Evolution, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Nucleogenesis| journal=CRL-41|year=1957|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/CRL-41.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}}
Aluminium has many known [[isotope]]s, whose mass numbers range from 21 to 42; however, only &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al ([[stable isotope]]) and &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al ([[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotope, [[half-life|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;= 7.2×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[year|y]]) occur naturally. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al has a natural abundance above 99.9%. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al is produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic-ray]] [[proton]]s. Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating [[ocean|marine]] sediments, manganese nodules, glacial ice, [[quartz]] in [[rock (geology)|rock]] exposures, and [[meteorite]]s. The ratio of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al to &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;[[beryllium|Be]] has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion on 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; year time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onafarawayday.com/Radiogenic/Ch14/Ch14-6.htm |title=Cosmogenic Isotopes and Aluminum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogenic]] &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was first applied in studies of the [[Moon]] and meteorites. Meteoroid fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding drastically reduces &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was responsible for the melting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of some [[asteroids]] after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert T. Dodd|title=Thunderstones and Shooting Stars|pages= 89–90|isbn=0-674-89137-6|year=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==

In the [[Earth's crust]], aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by weight) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon).&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood1997_p217&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its strong affinity to oxygen, it is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates. [[Feldspar]]s, the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can be found as a minor phase in low oxygen [[fugacity]] environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Aluminum Mineral Data|url = http://webmineral.com/data/Aluminum.shtml|accessdate = 2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native aluminium has been reported in [[cold seep]]s in the northeastern [[continental slope]] of the [[South China Sea]] and Chen et al. (2011)&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen 2011&quot;/&gt; have proposed a theory of its origin as resulting by [[Redox|reduction]] from [[tetrahydroxoaluminate]] Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; to metallic aluminium by [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen 2011&quot;&gt;Chen Z., Huang C.-Y., Zhao M., Yan W., Chien C.-W., Chen M., Yang H., Machiyama H. &amp; Lin S. (2011). &quot;Characteristics and possible origin of native aluminum in cold seep sediments from the northeastern South China Sea&quot;. ''[[Journal of Asian Earth Sciences]]'' '''40'''(1): 363-370. [[doi:doi:10.1016/j.jseaes.2010.06.006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It also occurs in the minerals [[beryl]], [[cryolite]], [[garnet]], [[spinel]] and [[turquoise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood1997_p218&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities in Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, such as [[chromium]] or [[cobalt]] yield the [[gemstone]]s [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood1997_p217&quot; /&gt; Pure Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, known as [[corundum]], is one of the hardest materials known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood1997_p218&quot; /&gt;

Although aluminium is an extremely common and widespread element, the common aluminium minerals are not economic sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the [[ore]] bauxite (AlO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3-2''x''&lt;/sub&gt;). Bauxite occurs as a [[weathering]] product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guilbert, John M. and Carles F. Park|title=The Geology of Ore Deposits|publisher=Freeman|year=1986|pages=774–795|isbn=0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large deposits of bauxite occur in Australia, [[Brazil]], [[Guinea]] and [[Jamaica]] but the primary mining areas for the ore are in [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], Russia and [[Surinam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emsley2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press

==Production and refinement==

Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust, it is never found in free, metallic form, and it was once considered a [[precious metal]] more valuable than gold. [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], Emperor of France, is reputed to have given a banquet where the most honoured guests were given aluminium utensils, while the others made do with gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = &quot;Silver&quot; from clay|author = S Venetski|journal = [[Metallurgist]]|volume = 13|page = 451|year=1969|doi = 10.1007/BF00741130|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ChemMatters October 1990 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Monument]] was completed, with the 100 ounce (2.8&amp;nbsp;kg) aluminium capstone being put in place on December 6, 1884, in an elaborate dedication ceremony. It was the largest single piece of aluminium cast at the time, when aluminium was as expensive as silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Point of a Monument: A History of the Aluminum Cap of the Washington Monument| author = G. J. Binczewski| journal = JOM|volume = 47| page = 20| year = 1995| url = http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9511/Binczewski-9511.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years.

[[File:Bauxite hérault.JPG|thumb|right|Bauxite]]
Aluminium is a strongly reactive metal that forms a high-energy chemical bond with oxygen. Compared to most other metals, it is difficult to extract from ore, such as [[bauxite]], due to the energy required to reduce aluminium oxide (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). For example, direct reduction with [[carbon]], as is used to produce [[iron]], is not chemically possible, since aluminium is a stronger reducing agent than carbon. There is an indirect carbothermic reduction possible by using carbon and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which forms an intermediate Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and this can further yield aluminium metal at a temperature of 1900–2000°C. This process is still under development. This process costs less energy and yields less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the [[Hall-Héroult process]], the major industrial process for aluminium extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Aluminum recycling and processing for energy conservation and sustainability| author = John A. S. Green|page = 198| year = 2007| url = http://books.google.com/?id=t-Jg-i0XlpcC&amp;pg=PA198| isbn = 0871708590| publisher = ASM International| location = Materials Park, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium oxide has a melting point of about {{convert|2000|°C|-2|abbr=on}}. Therefore, it must be extracted by [[electrolysis]]. In this process, the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten [[cryolite]] with [[calcium]] [[fluoride]] and then reduced to the pure metal. The operational temperature of the reduction cells is around {{convert|950|to|980|C|F|-1}}. Cryolite is found as a mineral in [[Greenland]], but in industrial use it has been replaced by a synthetic substance. Cryolite is a chemical compound of aluminium and [[sodium]] [[fluoride]]s: (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining bauxite in the [[Bayer process]] of [[Karl Bayer]]. (Previously, the [[Deville process]] was the predominant refining technology.)

The electrolytic process replaced the [[Wöhler process]], which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with [[potassium]]. Both of the [[electrode]]s used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon. Once the refined alumina is dissolved in the electrolyte, its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the [[cathode]] is:

:Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Al

Here the aluminium ion is being [[redox|reduced]]. The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off, usually cast into large blocks called [[Bar stock|aluminium billets]] for further processing.

At the [[anode]], oxygen is formed:
:2 O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

This carbon anode is then oxidized by the oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide:

:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process.

Unlike the anodes, the cathodes are not oxidized because there is no oxygen present, as the carbon cathodes are protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells. Nevertheless, cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes and metal movement. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear.

[[File:Aluminium - world production trend.svg|thumb|World production trend of aluminium]]
Aluminium electrolysis with the [[Hall-Héroult]] process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15±0.5 [[kilowatt-hour]]s per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg). The most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8&amp;nbsp;kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the [[heat of reaction]], 31 MJ/kg, and the [[Gibbs free energy]] of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 [[kiloampere]]s; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.

The Hall-Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the [[Hoope process]]. The process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium  and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 243 | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=vnuNnMpCJicC&amp;pg=PA243 | title = Industrial Chemistry | isbn = 9788126117598 | author1 = Kumar, N. | author2 = G, Arora M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 483 | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=iegDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA483 | title = Competition Science Vision | author1 = Darpan, Pratiyogita | date = 2000-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 122 | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=Vhvy2NiZsQYC&amp;pg=PA122 | title = Engineering Chemistry | isbn = 9780070669321 | author1 = Sivasankar, | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 40 | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=KpgTrFloOq0C&amp;pg=PA40 | title = Handbook of aluminum: Alloy production and materials manufacturing | isbn = 9780824748432 | author1 = Totten, George E | author2 = Scott Mackenzie, D | author3 = Comercial), Marcel Dekker (Firma | date = 2003-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Smelters tend to be situated where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive, such as [[South Africa]], [[Ghana]], the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]], Australia, the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Middle East]], [[Russia]], [[Quebec]] and [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]], and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Handbook of aluminium recycling: fundamentals, mechanical preparation, metallurgical processing, plant design| author= Christoph Schmitz, Josef Domagala, Petra Haag| publisher = Vulkan-Verlag GmbH|year =2006|isbn =3802729366|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aluminium output2.PNG|thumb|right|Aluminium output in 2005]]

In 2005, the People's Republic of China was the top producer of aluminium with almost a one-fifth world share, followed by Russia, Canada, and the USA, reports the [[British Geological Survey]].

==Recycling==
[[File:41 ALU Recycling Code.svg|150px|thumb|Aluminium [[recycling code]]]]
{{Main|Aluminium recycling}}
Aluminium is 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. Recovery of the metal via [[recycling]] has become an important facet of the aluminium industry.

Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as [[dross]] (ash-like oxide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Benefits of Recycling|publisher = Ohio Department of Natural Resources|url = http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/recycling/awareness/facts/benefits.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium.

Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium [[beverage can]]s brought it to the public awareness.

In [[Europe]] aluminium experiences high rates of recycling, ranging from 42% of beverage cans, 85% of construction materials and 95% of transport vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confemetal.es/aseral/recuperacion.htm |title=Reciclado del aluminio. Confemetal.es ASERAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of the alloy injections. Another important use is for extrusion.

White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hwang, J.Y., Huang, X., Xu, Z.|year=2006|title=Recovery of Metals from Aluminium Dross and Salt cake|journal=Journal of Minerals &amp; Materials Characterization &amp; Engineering|volume=5|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others, [[hydrogen]], [[acetylene]], and [[ammonia]]), which spontaneously ignites on contact with air;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiolandfills.org/faq/aluminium-dross-saltcake/ |title=Why are dross &amp; saltcake a concern?}}&lt;/ref&gt; contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, the waste has found use as a filler in [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunster, A.M., Moulinier, F., Abbott, B., Conroy, A., Adams, K., Widyatmoko, D.(2005).

===Oxidation state +3===
[[Fajans' rules]] show that the simple trivalent cation Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is not expected to be found in anhydrous salts or binary compounds such as Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The hydroxide is a weak base and aluminium salts of weak acids, such as carbonate, cannot be prepared. The salts of strong acids, such as nitrate, are stable and soluble in water, forming hydrates with at least six molecules of [[water of crystallization]].

[[Aluminium hydride]], (AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced from [[trimethylaluminium]] and an excess of hydrogen. It burns explosively in air. It can also be prepared by the action of aluminium chloride on [[lithium hydride]] in [[ether]] solution, but cannot be isolated free from the solvent. Alumino-hydrides of the most electropositive elements are known, the most useful being [[lithium aluminium hydride]], Li[AlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. It decomposes into lithium hydride, aluminium and hydrogen when heated, and is hydrolysed by water. It has many uses in organic chemistry, particularly as a reducing agent. The aluminohalides have a similar structure.

[[Aluminium hydroxide]] may be prepared as a gelatinous precipitate by adding ammonia to an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt. It is [[amphoteric]], being both a very weak acid, and forming aluminates with [[alkali]]s. It exists in various crystalline forms.

[[Aluminium carbide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is made by heating a mixture of the elements above {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The pale yellow crystals have a complex lattice structure, and react with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The [[metal acetylide|acetylide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.

[[Aluminium nitride]], AlN, can be made from the elements at {{convert|800|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is hydrolysed by water to form [[ammonia]] and [[aluminium hydroxide]]. [[Aluminium phosphide]], AlP, is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]].

[[Aluminium oxide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, occurs naturally as corundum, and can be made by burning aluminium in oxygen or by heating the hydroxide, nitrate or sulfate. As a gemstone, its hardness is only exceeded by [[diamond]], [[boron nitride]], and [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]]. It is almost insoluble in water. [[Aluminium sulfide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, may be prepared by passing [[hydrogen sulfide]] over aluminium powder. It is [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]].

[[Aluminium iodide]], AlI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] with applications in [[organic synthesis]]. [[Aluminium fluoride]], AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by treating the hydroxide with HF, or can be made from the elements. It is a [[macromolecule]], which sublimes without melting at {{convert|1291|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is very inert. The other trihalides are dimeric, having a bridge-like structure.

When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as {{chem|[AlF(H|2|O)|5|]|2+}}, {{chem|AlF|3|(H|2|O)|3}}, and {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}}. Of these, {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}} is the most stable. This is explained by the fact that aluminium and fluoride, which are both very compact ions, fit together just right to form the octahedral aluminium hexafluoride complex. When aluminium and fluoride are together in water in a 1:6 molar ratio, {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}} is the most common form, even in rather low concentrations.

Organometallic compounds of empirical formula AlR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exist and, if not also polymers, are at least dimers or trimers. They have some uses in organic synthesis, for instance trimethylaluminium.

===Analysis===
The presence of aluminium can be detected in qualitative analysis using [[aluminon]].

==Applications==
===General use===

Aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = aluminum|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-64454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes.

A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by [[physical vapour deposition]] or (very infrequently) [[chemical vapour deposition]] or other chemical means to form [[optical coating]]s and [[mirror]]s. When so deposited, a fresh, pure aluminium film serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of [[visible light]] and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far infrared radiation.

Pure aluminium has a low [[tensile strength]], but when combined with thermo-mechanical processing, aluminium alloys display a marked improvement in mechanical properties, especially when [[tempering|tempered]]. Aluminium alloys form vital components of [[aircraft]] and [[rocket]]s as a result of their high strength-to-weight ratio. Aluminium readily forms alloys with many elements such as copper, [[zinc]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]] and [[silicon]] (e.g., [[duralumin]]). Today, almost all bulk metal materials that are referred to loosely as &quot;aluminium&quot;, are actually alloys. For example, the common [[aluminium foil]]s and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = How Products are Made|author = Millberg, L.

===Aluminium alloys in structural applications===
[[File:Aluminium foam.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminium foam]]]]
{{Main|Aluminium alloy}}
Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ([[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ([[DIN]] and [[International Organization of Standardization|ISO]]).

The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation.

One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined [[fatigue limit]], meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. This implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a [[Fatigue (material)#Design against fatigue|fixed life]] rather than an infinite life.

Another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat.
Workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Forming operations where a [[blow torch]] is used therefore require some expertise, since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting. The problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low [[melting point]], which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the stresses.

The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry; even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500&amp;nbsp;K. The [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]] upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region.

===Household wiring===
{{See also|Aluminium wire}}

Compared to copper, aluminium has about 65% of the [[electrical conductivity]] by volume, although 200% by weight. Traditionally copper is used as household wiring material. In the 1960s aluminium was considerably cheaper than copper, and so was introduced for household electrical wiring in the United States, even though many fixtures were not designed to accept aluminium wire. In some cases the greater [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of aluminium causes the wire to expand and contract relative to the dissimilar metal [[screw]] connection, eventually loosening the connection. Also, pure aluminium has a tendency to ''[[creep (deformation)|creep]]'' under steady sustained pressure (to a greater degree as the temperature rises), again loosening the connection. Finally, [[galvanic corrosion]] from the dissimilar metals increased the electrical resistance of the connection.

All of this resulted in overheated and loose connections, and this in turn resulted in fires. Builders then became wary of using the wire, and many jurisdictions outlawed its use in very small sizes in new construction. Eventually, newer fixtures were introduced with connections designed to avoid loosening and overheating. The first generation fixtures were marked &quot;Al/Cu&quot; and were ultimately found suitable only for copper-clad aluminium wire, but the second generation fixtures, which bear a &quot;CO/ALR&quot; coding, are rated for unclad aluminium wire. To adapt older assemblies, workers forestall the heating problem using a properly done [[crimp (metalworking)|crimp]] of the aluminium wire to a short &quot;[[Patch cable|pigtail]]&quot; of copper wire. Today, new alloys, designs, and methods are used for aluminium wiring in combination with aluminium termination.

==History==
[[File:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of the [[Anteros]] (commonly mistaken for either ''The Angel of Christian Charity'' or ''Eros'') in [[Piccadilly Circus]] London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium.]]

Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds; [[alum]] is still used as a [[styptic]]. In 1761 [[Guyton de Morveau]] suggested calling the base alum ''alumine.'' In 1808, [[Humphry Davy]] identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first termed ''alumium'' and later ''aluminum'' (see [[#Name|etymology section]], below).

The metal was first produced in 1825 (in an impure form) by [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. He reacted [[anhydrous]] [[aluminium chloride]] with [[potassium]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] and yielded a lump of metal looking similar to tin.&lt;ref name=&quot;woehler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber das Aluminium|first = Friedrich|last = Wöhler|authorlink = Friedrich Wöhler|journal = Annalen der Physik und Chemie|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k150967/f158.table}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Friedrich Wöhler]] was aware of these experiments and cited them, but after redoing the experiments of Ørsted he concluded that this metal was pure potassium. He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and yielded aluminium.&lt;ref name=&quot;woehler&quot;/&gt; Wöhler is generally credited with isolating aluminium ([[Latin]] ''alumen'', alum), but also Ørsted can be listed as its discoverer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = ChemicalElements.com|title = Periodic Table: Aluminum|url = http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements/al.html|author = Bentor, Yinon |accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Pierre Berthier]] discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Today in Science History|title = Pierre Berthier|url = http://www.todayinsci.com/7/7_03.htm#Berthier|accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frenchman [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] improved Wöhler's method in 1846, and described his improvements in a book in 1859, chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=rCoKAAAAIAAJ De l'aluminium, ses propriétés, sa fabrication]'' (Paris, 1859)&lt;/ref&gt; Deville likely also conceived the idea of the [[electrolysis]] of aluminium oxide dissolved in cryolite; [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Paul Héroult might have developed the more practical process after Deville.

Before the [[Hall-Héroult process]] was developed, aluminium was exceedingly difficult to extract from its various [[ore]]s. This made pure aluminium more valuable than gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=td0jD4it63cC&amp;pg=PT29|pages = 15–16|isbn = 9780750663717|chapter = Production of Aluminium|author = Polmear, I.J. |year = 2006|publisher = Elsevier/Butterworth-Heinemann|location = Oxford|title = Light alloys from traditional alloys to nanocrystals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bars of aluminium were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle of 1855]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Polytechnisches Journal|volume = 171|issue = 1| year = 1864|title = Fernerer Beitrag zur Geschichte des Aluminiums|first = Carl| last = Karmarsch|url = http://books.google.com/?id=v4MtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] was said{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} to have reserved a set of aluminium dinner plates for his most honoured guests.

Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the [[Washington Monument]] in 1884, a time when one [[ounce]] (30&amp;nbsp;grams) cost the daily wage of a common worker on the project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = George J.

The [[Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company|Cowles companies]] supplied aluminium alloy in quantity in the [[United States]] and England using [[smelting|smelters]] like the furnace of [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] by 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cowles' Aluminium Alloys|page=13|year=1886|journal=The Manufacturer and Builder|location=New York|volume=18|issue=1|publisher=Western and Company, via Cornell University Library|url=http://moa.cit.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fmanu%2Fmanu0018%2F&amp;tif=00019.TIF|accessdate=2007-10-27}} and {{cite book|author=McMillan, Walter George|title=A Treatise on Electro-Metallurgy|publisher=Charles Griffin and Company, J.B.

Hunt]], started the Pittsburgh Reduction Company today known as [[Alcoa]]. Héroult's process was in production by 1889 in [[Switzerland]] at Aluminium Industrie, now [[Alcan]], and at [[British Aluminium]], now [[Luxfer Group]] and Alcoa, by 1896 in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Wallace, Donald Holmes |title=Market Control in the Aluminum Industry|url=http://books.google.com/?id=E-acdJWbo90C&amp;pg=PA6|year=1977|origyear=1937|page=6|isbn=0-4050-9786-7|publisher=Harvard University Press via Ayer Publishing via Google Books limited view|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1895 the metal was being used as a building material as far away as [[Sydney]], Australia in the dome of the Chief Secretary's Building.

Many navies have used an aluminium [[superstructure]] for their vessels; the 1975 fire aboard [[USS Belknap (CG-26)|USS ''Belknap'']] that gutted her aluminium superstructure, as well as observation of battle damage to British ships during the [[Falklands War]], led to many navies switching to all steel superstructures. The [[Arleigh Burke class|''Arleigh Burke'' class]] was the first such U.S. ship, being constructed entirely of steel.

In 2008 the price of aluminium peaked at $1.45/lb in July but dropped to $0.70/[[Pound (mass)|lb]] by December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infomine.com/commodities/aluminum.asp Aluminum prices].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
There are two variants of the metal's name in current use, ''aluminium'' and ''aluminum'' (besides the obsolete ''alumium'').
The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted ''aluminium'' as the standard international name for the element in 1990, but three years later recognized ''aluminum'' as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/index.html IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements].&lt;/ref&gt; IUPAC prefers the use of ''aluminium'' in its internal publications, although nearly as many IUPAC publications use the spelling ''aluminum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=aluminum&amp;sitesearch=iupac.org IUPAC Web site publication search for 'aluminum'].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries use the spelling ''aluminium''. In the United States, the spelling ''aluminum'' predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bremner, John ''Words on Words: A Dictionary for Writers and Others Who Care about Words'', pp. 22–23. ISBN 0-231-04493-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminum'', whereas the Australian [[Macquarie Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminium''. In 1926, the [[American Chemical Society]] officially decided to use ''aluminum'' in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling ''aluminium'' as a British variant.

The name  derives from its status as a base of [[alum]]. &quot;Alum&quot; in turn is a [[Latin]] word that literally means &quot;bitter salt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Alum&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for any word used as a name for this element is ''alumium'', which British chemist and inventor [[Humphry Davy]] employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral ''[[alumina]]''. The citation is from the journal ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'': &quot;Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;alumium&quot;, ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, second edition Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. Accessed 29 October 2006. Citation is listed as &quot;1808 SIR H. DAVY in Phil.

Davy settled on ''aluminum'' by the time he published his 1812 book ''Chemical Philosophy'': &quot;This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina.&quot;&lt;ref name=Davy1812&gt;{{cite book

The ''-ium'' suffix conformed to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, ''-um'' spellings for elements were not unknown at the time, as for example [[platinum]], known to Europeans since the [[16th century]], [[molybdenum]], discovered in 1778, and [[tantalum]], discovered in 1802. The ''-um'' suffix is consistent with the universal spelling [[alumina]] for the [[oxide]], as [[lanthana]] is the oxide of [[lanthanum]], and [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[ceria]], and [[thoria]] are the oxides of [[magnesium]], [[cerium]], and [[thorium]] respectively.

The spelling used throughout the 19th century by most U.S. chemists was ''aluminium'', but common usage is less clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwords&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm|title=ALUMINIUM VERSUS ALUMINUM: Why two spellings?|author=Quinion, Michael |publisher=World Wide Words|date=December 16, 2000}}, &quot;In the USA, the position was more complicated. Noah Webster's Dictionary of 1828 has only aluminum, though the standard spelling among US chemists throughout most of the nineteenth century was aluminium; it was the preferred version in The Century Dictionary of 1889 and is the only spelling given in the Webster Unabridged Dictionary of 1913.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aluminum'' spelling is used in the [[Webster's Dictionary]] of 1828. In his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal 1892, Charles Martin Hall used the ''-um'' spelling, despite his constant use of the ''-ium'' spelling in all the patents&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall-patent&quot;/&gt; he filed between 1886 and 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Meiers, Peter |publisher = The History of Fluorine, Fluoride and Fluoridation|title = Manufacture of Aluminum|url =http://www.fluoride-history.de/p-aluminum.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has consequently been suggested that the spelling reflects an easier to pronounce word with one fewer syllable, or that the spelling on the flier was a mistake. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling ''aluminum'' became the standard in North America; the ''Webster Unabridged Dictionary'' of 1913, though, continued to use the ''-ium'' version.

Despite its natural abundance, aluminium has no known function in living cells and presents some toxic effects in elevated concentrations. Its toxicity can be traced to deposition in bone and the central nervous system, which is particularly increased in patients with reduced renal function. Because aluminium competes with calcium for absorption, increased amounts of dietary aluminium may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation. In very high doses, aluminium can cause [[neurotoxicity]], and is associated with altered function of the [[blood-brain barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Banks, W.A.|year = 1989|title = Aluminum-induced neurotoxicity: alterations in membrane function at the blood-brain barrier|journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev|volume = 13|issue = 1|pages = 47–53|doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80051-X|pmid = 2671833|last2 = Kastin|first2 = AJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of people are [[allergy|allergic]] to aluminium and experience [[contact dermatitis]], [[digestion|digestive]] disorders, [[vomiting]] or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as [[deodorant]]s or antacids. In those without allergies, aluminium is not as toxic as [[heavy metals]], but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Dangers of Aluminum Toxicity| url = http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art7739.asp| accessdate = 2009-05-05| author = Abreo, V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of aluminium [[cookware]] has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general, excessive consumption of [[antacid]]s containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels.

[[Wheat]]'s [[adaptation]] to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of [[organic compound]]s that bind to the harmful aluminium [[cations]]. [[Sorghum]] is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat. It was shown that sorghum's aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene, as for wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Comparative Mapping of a Major Aluminum Tolerance Gene in Sorghum and Other Species in the Poaceae| first8 = LV| last8 = Kochian| first7 = L| last7 = Li| first6 = RE| last6 = Schaffert| first5 = PE| last5 = Klein| first4 = ME| last4 = Sorrells| first3 = Y| last3 = Wang| first2 = DF| last2 = Garvin|author = Magalhaes, J.

'''Advanced Chemistry''' is a [[German hip hop]] group from [[Heidelberg]], a scenic city in [[Baden-Württemberg]], South Germany. Advanced Chemistry was founded in 1987 by Toni L, Linguist, Gee-One, DJ Mike MD (Mike Dippon) and MC Torch. Each member of the group holds German citizenshhip, and Toni L, Linguist, and Torch are of Italian, Ghanaian, and Haitian backgrounds, respectively.&lt;ref name = &quot;lqomwy&quot;&gt;Pennay, Mark &quot;Rap in Germinay&quot; in Mitchell, Tony ed. Global Noise. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[North America]]n socially [[conscious hip hop|conscious rap]] and the [[Native Tongues Posse|Native tongues movement]], Advanced Chemistry is regarded as one of the main pioneers in German hip hop. They were one of the first groups to rap in German (although their name is in English). Furthermore, their songs tackled controversial social and political issues, distinguishing them from early German hip hop group &quot;[[Die Fantastischen Vier]]&quot; (The Fantastic Four),  which had a more light-hearted, playful, party image.&lt;ref name = &quot;lqomwy&quot;/&gt; 

The rivalry between Advanced Chemistry and Die Fantastischen Vier has served to highlight a dichotomy in the routes that hip hop has taken in becoming a part of the German soundscape.  While Die Fantastischen Vier may be said to view hip hop primarily as an esthetic art form,  Advanced Chemistry understand hip hop as being inextricably linked to the social and political circumstances under which it is created.  For Advanced Chemistry, hip hop is a “vehicle of general human emancipation,”.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Brown, Timothy S. &quot;'Keeping it Real' in a Different 'Hood:(African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.&quot; In The Vinyl Ain'tFinal: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 137-50. London&lt;/ref&gt;  In their undertaking of social and political issues, the band introduced the term &quot;Afro-German&quot; in to the context of German hip hop, and the theme of race is highlighted in much of their music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koelnischerkunstverein.de/migration/english/content/kuenstlerliste/advanced.htm projekt migration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the single “Fremd im eigenen Land”, Advanced Chemistry separated itself from the rest of the rap being produced in Germany.  This single was the first of its kind to go beyond simply imitating US rap and addressed the current issues of the time. Fremd im eigenen Land which translates to “foreign in my own country” dealt with the widespread racism that non-white German citizens faced.  This change from simple imitation to political commentary was the start of German identification with rap.&lt;ref name=&quot;lqomwy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nomadicwax.com/2007/12/16/hip-hop-in-germany/ Hip hop in Germany : Nomadic Wax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of “Fremd im eigenen Land” was influenced by the 'wall of noise' created by Public Enemy's producers, The Bomb Squad.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Bomb Squad]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reunification of Germany, an abundance of anti-immigrant sentiment emerged, as well as attacks on the homes of refugees in the early 90's.  Advanced Chemistry came to prominence in the wake of these actions because of their pro-multicultural society stance in their music.  Advanced Chemistry's attitudes revolve around their attempts to create a distinct &quot;Germanness&quot; in hip hop, as opposed to imitating American hip hop as other groups had done.  Torch has said, &quot;What the Americans do is exotic for us because we don't live like they do.  What they do seems to be more interesting and newer. But not for me.  For me it's more exciting to experience my fellow Germans in new contexts...For me, it's interesting to see what the kids try to do that's different from what I know.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Timothy S. “‘Keeping it Real’ in a Different ‘Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.” In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 137-50. London; A&lt;/ref&gt;  Advanced Chemistry were the first to use the term &quot;Afro-German&quot; in a hip hop context.  This was part of the pro-immigrant political message they sent via their music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deutschrap.blogspot.com/2008/03/classic-german-hip-hop.html deutschrap.com: Classic German Hip-Hop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Advanced Chemistry's use of the [[German language]] in their rap allows them to make claims to authenticity and true German heritage, bolstering pro-immigration sentiment, their style can also be problematic for immigrant notions of any real ethnic roots. Indeed, part of the Turkish ethnic minority of [[Frankfurt]] views Advanced Chemistry's appeal to the German image as a &quot;symbolic betrayal of the right of ethnic minorities to 'roots' or to any expression of cultural heritage.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; In this sense, their rap represents a complex social discourse internal to the [[German soundscape]] in which they attempt to negotiate immigrant assimilation into a xenophobic [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] with the maintenance of their own separate cultural traditions. It is quite possibly the feelings of alienation from the pure-blooded German demographic that drive Advanced Chemistry to attack nationalistic ideologies by asserting their &quot;Germanness&quot; as a group composed primarily of ethnic others. The response to this pseudo-German authenticity can be seen in what [[Andy Bennett]] refers to as &quot;alternative forms of local hip hop culture which actively seek to rediscover and, in many cases, reconstruct notions of identity tied to cultural roots.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Andy. &quot;Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities.&quot; In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177-200. New York; London: Routledge, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; These alternative local hip hop cultures include [[Oriental hip hop]], the members of which cling to their Turkish heritage and are confused by Advanced Chemistry's elicitation of a German identity politics to which they technically do not belong. This cultural binary illustrates that rap has taken different routes in Germany and that, even among an already isolated immigrant population, there is still disunity and, especially, disagreement on the relative importance of assimilation versus cultural defiance. According to German hip hop enthusiast 9@home, Advanced Chemistry is part of a &quot;hip-hop movement [which] took a clear stance for the minorities and against the [marginalization] of immigrants who...might be German on paper, but not in real life,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;9@home. &quot;German Hip Hop 1: Advanced Chemistry.&quot; Leave Your Nine at Home. 13 Oct. 2007. Vanila Mist.  27 Mar. 2008 [http://leaveyournineathome.wordpress.com/2007/10/13/german-hip-hop-1-advanced-chemistry/]&lt;/ref&gt; which speaks to the group's hope of actually being recognized as German citizens and not foreigners, despite their various other ethnic and cultural ties.

==Market conditions for rap==
One of the first issues that confronts us{{Who|date=October 2009}} when we move outside the English-speaking market for recorded music is to establish whether or not the discrete musical genres we{{Who|date=October 2009}} know from that market are fully congruent with similar divisions in other pop worlds. This is important in two ways. First, although no single country comes close to matching the amounts spent on recorded music in the United States, these markets are nonetheless economically significant. Germany, for instance, is the largest single market in western Europe, with estimated annual sales of U.S. $3.74 billion in 1996. This represents around 30 percent of reported U.S. sales and makes Germany the third biggest music market in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, Tony Global Noise (Rap and Hip-Hop outside the USA) Published by Wesleyan University Press, Middletown CT. 06549 (C)2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

Advanced Chemistry frequently rapped about their lives and experiences as children of immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=828 The Atlantic Times :: Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; exposing the marginalization experienced by most ethnic minorities in Germany, and the feelings of frustration and resentment that being denied a German identity can cause.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Andy. &quot;Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities.&quot; In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177-200. New York; London: Routledge, 2004, p. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;Fremd im eigenem Land&quot; (Foreign in your own nation) was released by Advanced Chemistry in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Advanced+Chemistry Advanced Chemistry Discography]&lt;/ref&gt; The single became a staple in the [[German hip hop]] scene. It made a strong statement about the status of immigrants throughout Germany, as the group was composed of multi-national and multi-racial members. The video shows several members brandishing their German passports as a demonstration of their German citizenship to skeptical and unaccepting 'ethnic' Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 

This idea of national identity is important, as many rap artists in Germany have been of foreign origin. These so-called ''Gastarbeiter'' (guest workers) children saw breakdance, graffiti, rap music, and hip hop culture as a means of expressing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Johannes. ''Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German''&gt;Vol. 36, No. 1. (Spring, 2003) pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of &quot;Fremd im eigenen Land&quot;, many other German-language rappers have also tried to confront anti-immigrant ideas and develop themes of citizenship. However, though many ethnic minority youth in Germany find the these German identity themes appealing, others view the desire of immigrants to be seen as German negatively, and they have actively sought to revive and recreate concepts of identity in connection to traditional ethnic origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett&quot;/&gt;      

Advanced Chemistry helped to found the German chapter of the Zulu nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://leaveyournineathome.wordpress.com/2007/10/13/german-hip-hop-1-advanced-chemistry/.  Accessed March 26. Last updated October 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}} 
The '''Anglican Communion''' is an international association of national and regional [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches. There is no single &quot;Anglican Church&quot; with universal juridical authority as each national or regional church has full autonomy. As the name suggests, the Anglican ''Communion'' is an association of these churches in [[full communion]] with the [[Church of England]] (which may be regarded as the [[mother church]] of the worldwide communion) and specifically with its principal [[primate (religion)|primate]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aco.org/communion/abc/index.cfm The Archbishop of Canterbury is the Focus for Unity]&lt;/ref&gt; The status of full communion means, ideally, that there is mutual agreement on essential doctrines, and that full participation in the sacramental life of each national church is available to all [[communicant]] Anglicans.

With approximately more than 80&amp;nbsp;million members world wide, the Anglican Communion is the fourth largest Christian communion in the world, after the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches|Reformed Church]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;anglicancommunion.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/ The Anglican Communion Official Website—Welcome]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Branches of Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://warc.jalb.de/warcajsp/side.jsp?news_id=631&amp;part_id=0&amp;navi=6 &quot;A 'major step forward in unity' in Reformed family of Churches&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these churches are known as Anglican, explicitly recognising the historical link to England (''Ecclesia Anglicana'' means &quot;Church of England&quot;); others, such as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|American]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish]] Episcopal churches, or the [[Church of Ireland]], prefer a separate name. Each church has its own [[Anglican doctrine|doctrine]] and [[liturgy]], based in most cases on that of the Church of England; and each church has its own legislative process and overall [[episcopal polity]], under the leadership of a local primate.

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], religious head of the Church of England, has no formal authority outside that jurisdiction, but is recognised as symbolic head of the worldwide communion. Among the other primates he is ''[[primus inter pares]]'', which translates &quot;first among equals&quot;.

The Anglican Communion considers itself to be part of the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]] and to be both [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestant|Reformed]]. For some adherents it represents a non-papal Catholicism, for others a form of [[Protestantism]] though without a dominant guiding figure such as [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Knox|Knox]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] or [[John Wesley|Wesley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avis|first=Paul|chapter=What is 'Anglicanism'?|title=The Study of Anglicanism|editor=S. Sykes and J. Booty (eds)|location=London|publisher=SPCK|year=1988|pages=417–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For others, their self-identity represents some combination of the two. The communion encompasses a wide spectrum of belief and practice including [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]], and [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic]].

The Anglican Communion Office is headed by its Secretary General, the Revd Canon Kenneth Kearon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2004/7/20/ACNS3855 |title=Archbishop announces new Anglican Communion Secretary General |accessdate=14 March 2011 |date=20 July 2004 |work=Anglican Communion News Service |publisher=Anglican Communion Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiology, polity, ethos==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
{{Main|Anglican doctrine}}
The Anglican Communion has no official legal existence nor any governing structure which might exercise authority over the member churches. There is an Anglican Communion Office in London, under the aegis of the Archbishop of Canterbury, but it only serves a supporting and organisational role. The Communion is held together by a shared history, expressed in its [[ecclesiology]], [[polity]] and [[ethos]] and also by participation in international consultative bodies.

Three elements have been important in holding the Communion together: First, the shared ecclesial structure of the component churches, manifested in an [[episcopal polity]] maintained through the [[apostolic succession]] of bishops and [[synod]]ical government; second, the principle of belief expressed in worship, investing importance in approved prayer books and their rubrics; and third, the historical documents and standard [[divinity (academic discipline)|divines]] that have influenced the ethos of the Communion.

Originally, the Church of England was self-contained and relied for its unity and identity on its own history, its traditional legal and episcopal structure and its status as an [[established church]] of the state. As such Anglicanism was, from the outset, a movement with an explicitly [[episcopal polity]], a characteristic which has been vital in maintaining the unity of the Communion by conveying the episcopate's role in manifesting visible catholicity and ecumenism.

Early in its development, Anglicanism developed a vernacular prayer book, called the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. Unlike other traditions, Anglicanism has never been governed by a [[magisterium]] nor by appeal to one founding [[theology|theologian]], nor by an extra-credal summary of doctrine (such as the [[Westminster Confession]] of the [[Presbyterian]] Church). Instead, Anglicans have typically appealed to the Book of Common Prayer and its offshoots as a guide to Anglican theology and practice. This had the effect of inculcating the principle of ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]'' (&quot;the law of prayer is the law of belief&quot;) as the foundation of Anglican identity and confession.

Protracted conflict through the seventeenth century with more radical [[Protestant]]s on the one hand and Roman Catholics who still recognised the primacy of the [[Pope]] on the other, resulted in an association of churches that were both deliberately vague about doctrinal principles, yet bold in developing parameters of acceptable deviation. These parameters were most clearly articulated in the various [[rubric]]s of the successive prayer books, as well as the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of Religion. These Articles (though no longer binding) have had an influence on the ethos of the Communion, an ethos reinforced by their interpretation and expansion by such influential early theologians as [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], [[Lancelot Andrewes]], [[John Cosin]], and others.

With the expansion of the [[British Empire]], and hence the growth of Anglicanism outside Great Britain and Ireland, the Communion sought to establish new vehicles of unity. The first major expression of this were the [[Lambeth Conference]]s of the communion's bishops, first convened by Archbishop of Canterbury [[Charles Longley]] in 1867. From the outset, these were not intended to displace the autonomy of the emerging provinces of the Communion, but to &quot;discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action.&quot;

==Chicago Lambeth Quadrilateral==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
One of the enduringly influential early resolutions of the conference was the so-called [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of 1888. Its intent was to provide the basis for discussions of reunion with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches, but it had the ancillary effect of establishing parameters of Anglican identity. It establishes four principles with these words:

:That, in the opinion of this Conference, the following Articles supply a basis on which approach may be by God's blessing made towards Home Reunion:

:(a) The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as &quot;containing all things necessary to salvation,&quot; and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.
:(b) The Apostles' Creed, as the Baptismal Symbol; and the Nicene Creed, as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.
:(c) The two Sacraments ordained by Christ Himself - Baptism and the Supper of the Lord - ministered with unfailing use of Christ's [[Words of Institution]], and of the elements ordained by Him.
:(d) The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church.
&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press, 1979, page 877 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments of communion==
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2010}}
As mentioned above, the Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. The Archbishop of Canterbury's role is strictly symbolic and unifying and the Communion's three international bodies are consultative and collaborative, their resolutions having no legal effect on the independent provinces of the Communion. Taken together, however, the four do function as &quot;instruments of communion&quot;, since all churches of the communion participate in them. In order of antiquity, they are:

# The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (''ab origine'') functions as the spiritual head of the Communion. He is the focus of unity, since no church claims membership in the Communion without being in communion with him. The present incumbent is Dr [[Rowan Williams]].
# The [[Lambeth Conference]] (first held in 1867) is the oldest international consultation. It is a forum for bishops of the Communion to reinforce unity and collegiality through manifesting the [[episcopate]], to discuss matters of mutual concern, and to pass resolutions intended to act as guideposts. It is held roughly every ten years and invitation is by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
# The [[Anglican Consultative Council]] (first met in 1971) was created by a 1968 Lambeth Conference resolution, and meets usually at three year intervals. The council consists of representative bishops, clergy, and laity chosen by the thirty-eight provinces. The body has a permanent secretariat, the Anglican Communion Office, of which the Archbishop of Canterbury is president.
# The [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting|Primates' Meeting]] (first met in 1979) is the most recent manifestation of international consultation and deliberation, having been first convened by Archbishop [[Donald Coggan]] as a forum for &quot;leisurely thought, prayer and deep consultation&quot;.

Since there is no binding authority in the Communion, these international bodies are a vehicle for consultation and persuasion. In recent years, persuasion has tipped over into debates over conformity in certain areas of doctrine, discipline, worship, and ethics. The most notable example has been the objection of many provinces of the Communion (particularly in Africa and Asia) to the changing role of homosexuals in the North American churches (e.g., by [[same-sex unions|blessing same-sex unions]] and ordaining and consecrating gays and lesbians in same-sex relationships), and to the process by which changes were undertaken. Those who objected condemned these actions as unscriptural, unilateral, and without the agreement of the Communion prior to these steps being taken. In response, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|American Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] answered that the actions had been undertaken after lengthy scriptural and theological reflection, legally in accordance with their own [[canon law|canons and constitutions]] and after extensive consultation with the provinces of the Communion.

The Primates' Meeting voted to request the two churches to withdraw their delegates from the 2005 meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council. Canada and the United States decided to attend the meeting but without exercising their right to vote. They have not been expelled or suspended, since there is no mechanism in this voluntary association to suspend or expel an independent province of the Communion. Since membership is based on a province's communion with Canterbury, expulsion would require the Archbishop of Canterbury's refusal to be in communion with the affected jurisdiction(s). In line with the suggestion of the [[Windsor Report]], Williams has recently established a working group to examine the feasibility of an Anglican covenant which would articulate the conditions for communion in some fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/41/50/acns4164.cfm Archbishop of Canterbury: address to General Synod on the Anglican Communion, ACNS 4164, 7 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provinces of the Anglican Communion==
All thirty-eight [[Ecclesiastical Province#Anglican Communion|provinces]] of the Anglican Communion are independent, each with its own [[primate (religion)|primate]] and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, [[Uganda]], or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the [[West Indies]], [[Central Africa]], or [[Southeast Asia]]). They are, in alphabetical order:

In addition to other member churches, the churches of the Anglican Communion are in [[full communion]] with the [[Old Catholic]] Churches of the [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Union of Utrecht]] in Europe, the India-based [[Mar Thoma Church]], and the [[Philippine Independent Church]], also known as the Aglipayan Church.

==History==
{{See also|History of the Anglican Communion}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The Anglican Communion is a relatively recent concept. The [[Church of England]] (which until the 20th century included the [[Church in Wales]]) initially separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1538 in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], reunited in 1555 under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] and then separated again in 1570 under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Elizabeth I in 1570 in response to the [[Act of Supremacy 1559]]). The [[Church of England]] has always thought of itself not as a new foundation but rather as a reformed continuation of the ancient &quot;English Church&quot; (Ecclesia Anglicana) and a reassertion of that church's rights. As such it was a distinctly national phenomenon. The [[Church of Scotland]] separated from the Roman Catholic Church with the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, and the split from it of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] began in 1582, in the reign of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], over disagreements about the role of bishops.

The oldest-surviving Anglican church outside of the British Isles (Britain and Ireland) is [[St. Peter's Church, St. George's|St Peter's Church]] in [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], [[Bermuda]], established in 1612 (though the actual building had to be rebuilt several times over the following century). This is also the oldest surviving non-Roman Catholic church in the [[New World]]. It remained part of the Church of England until 1978 when the [[Anglican Church of Bermuda]] separated. The Church of England was the established church not only in England, but in its trans-Oceanic colonies.

Thus the only member churches of the present Anglican Communion existing by the mid-18th century were the Church of England, its closely linked sister church, the [[Church of Ireland]] (which also separated from Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII) and the Scottish Episcopal Church which for parts of the 17th and 18th centuries was partially underground (it was suspected of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies).

However, the enormous expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries of the [[British Empire]] brought Anglicanism along with it. At first all these colonial churches were under the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of London]]. After the [[American Revolution]], the parishes in the newly independent country found it necessary to break formally from a church whose [[Supreme Governor]] was (and remains) the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]]. Thus they formed their own dioceses and national church, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], in a mostly amicable separation.

At about the same time, in the colonies which remained linked to the crown, the Church of England began to appoint colonial bishops. In 1787 a bishop of [[Nova Scotia]] was appointed with a jurisdiction over all of British North America; in time several more colleagues were appointed to other cities in present-day Canada. In 1814 a bishop of [[Calcutta]] was made; in 1824 the first bishop was sent to the [[West Indies]] and in 1836 to Australia. By 1840 there were still only ten colonial bishops for the Church of England; but even this small beginning greatly facilitated the growth of Anglicanism around the world. In 1841 a &quot;Colonial Bishoprics Council&quot; was set up and soon many more dioceses were created.

In time, it became natural to group these into provinces and a [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] was appointed for each province. Although it had at first been somewhat established in many colonies, in 1861 it was ruled that, except where specifically established, the Church of England had just the same legal position as any other church. Thus a colonial bishop and colonial diocese was by nature quite a different thing from their counterparts back home. In time bishops came to be appointed locally rather than from England and eventually national synods began to pass ecclesiastical legislation independent of England.

A crucial step in the development of the modern communion was the idea of the [[Lambeth Conference]]s (discussed above). These conferences demonstrated that the bishops of disparate churches could manifest the unity of the church in their episcopal collegiality despite the absence of universal legal ties. Some bishops were initially reluctant to attend, fearing that the meeting would declare itself a council with power to legislate for the church; but it agreed to pass only advisory resolutions. These Lambeth Conferences have been held roughly every 10 years since 1878 (the second such conference) and remain the most visible coming-together of the whole Communion.

==Ecumenical relations==
{{details|Anglican communion and ecumenism|the on-going dialogue between Anglicanism and the wider Church}}

==Historic episcopate==
The churches of the Anglican Communion have traditionally held that ordination in the [[historic episcopate]] is a core element in the validity of clerical ordinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/whipple/unity1896/ Unity and the Lambeth Declaration, a collection of essays about the Quadrilateral]&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church does not recognise most Anglican orders (see ''[[Apostolicae Curae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cepope&quot;&gt;{{ws|&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Apostolicae Curae|Apostolicae Curae]]&quot; in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es have issued statements to the effect that Anglican orders could be accepted, yet have still reordained former Anglican clergy; other Orthodox churches have rejected Anglican orders altogether. Orthodox bishop [[Kallistos Ware]] explains this apparent discrepancy as follows:

''Anglican clergy who join the Orthodox Church are reordained; but [some Orthodox Churches hold that] if Anglicanism and Orthodoxy were to reach full unity in the faith, perhaps such reordination might not be found necessary. It should be added, however, that a number of individual Orthodox theologians hold that under no circumstances would it be possible to recognise the validity of Anglican Orders.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/history_timothy_ware_2.htm Excerpts from the Orthodox Church by Bishop Kallistos Ware]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
{{See also|Homosexuality and Anglicanism|Anglican realignment}}
One effect of the Communion's dispersed authority has been that conflict and controversy regularly arise over the effect divergent practices and doctrines in one part of the Communion have on others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Disputes that had been confined to the Church of England could be dealt with legislatively in that realm, but as the Communion spread out into new nations and disparate cultures, such controversies multiplied and intensified. These controversies have generally been of two types: liturgical and social.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The first such controversy of note concerned that of the growing influence of the [[Catholic Revival]] manifested in the [[tractarian]] and so-called [[ritualism]] controversies of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Later, rapid social change and the dissipation of British cultural hegemony over its former colonies contributed to disputes over the role of women, the parameters of marriage and divorce, and the practice of [[contraception]] and [[abortion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} More recently, disagreements over homosexuality have strained the unity of the Communion as well as its relationships with other Christian denominations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Simultaneous with debates about social theology and ethics, the Communion has debated prayer book revision and the acceptable grounds for achieving full communion with non-Anglican churches.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

An '''archipelago'''  ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɑr|k|ɨ|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|ə|ɡ|oʊ}} {{respell|ark-i|PEL|ə-goh}}) is a chain or cluster of [[island]]s. The word ''archipelago''  is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἄρχι- – arkhi-'' (&quot;chief&quot;) and ''πέλαγος – pélagos'' (&quot;sea&quot;) through the Italian '''arcipelago'''. In [[Italian language|Italian]], possibly following a tradition of [[Ancient Greece|antiquity]], the '''Arcipelago''' (from [[medieval Greek]] [[Linguistic reconstruction|*]]ἀρχιπέλαγος) was the proper name for the [[Aegean Sea]] and, later, usage shifted to refer to the [[Aegean Islands]] (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands).  It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a large number of scattered islands such as the Aegean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/archipelago |title=Archipelago |accessdate=2008-10-02 |year=2008 |publisher=Farlex, Inc. |archiveurl=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/archipelago |archivedate=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fernando noronha.jpg|thumb|left|235px|The archipelago of [[Fernando de Noronha]]]]
Archipelagos may be found isolated in bodies of water or neighboring a large [[land mass]]. For example, [[Scotland]] has more than 700 islands surrounding its mainland which constitute an archipelago. Archipelagos are often [[volcano|volcanic]], forming along [[island arc]]s generated by [[subduction|subduction zones]] or [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], but may also be the result of [[erosion]], [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] and [[land elevation]].

The five largest modern countries that are mainly archipelagos are [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The largest archipelagic state in the world, by area, is Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Indonesia | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency | work=The World Factbook | date=2008-12-04 | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html | accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago with the most islands is the [[Archipelago Sea]] in [[Finland]].

{{Other uses}}

An '''author''' (sometimes, in reference to a female author, '''authoress'''&lt;ref name=&quot;authoressref&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=authoress - definition at Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/authoress|publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is broadly defined as &quot;the person who originates or gives existence to anything&quot; and that authorship determines responsibility for what is created. Narrowly defined, an author is the originator of any written work.

==Author of a written or legally copied work==
===Legal significance===
In [[copyright law]], there is necessarily for little flexibility as to what constitutes authorship. The [[United States Copyright Office]] defines copyright as &quot;a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of &quot;original works of authorship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Copyright Office Basics |
publisher = [[U.S. Copyright Office]] |
url = http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html |
date = July 2006 |ffffewfRFWEF
accessdate= 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding the title of &quot;author&quot; over any &quot;literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, [or] certain other intellectual works&quot; give rights to this person, the owner of the copyright, exclusive right to do or authorize any production or distribution of their work. Any person or entity wishing to use [[intellectual property]] held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work, and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material. After a fixed amount of time, the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain, where it can be used without limit. Copyright law has been amended time and time again since the inception of the law to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder. However, copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his/her work. Technically, someone owns their work from the time it's created. An interesting aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that it can be passed down to another upon one's death. The person who inherits the copyright is not the author, but enjoys the same legal benefits.
hi
Questions arise as to the application of copyright law. How does it, for example, apply to the complex issue of [[fan fiction]]?  If the media agency responsible for the authorized [[Manufacturing|production]] allows material from fans, what is the limit before legal constraints from actors, music, and other considerations, come into play? As well, how does copyright apply to fan-generated stories for books? What powers do the original authors, as well as the publishers, have in regulating or even stopping the fan fiction?

===Literary significance===
In literary theory, critics find complications in the term &quot;author&quot; beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting. In the wake of postmodern literature, critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of a text.

Barthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author. He quotes, in his essay ''&quot;Death of the Author&quot;'' (1968), that &quot;it is language which speaks, not the author&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barthes&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Barthes |
first = Roland |
chapter = The Death of the Author |
year = 1968 |
title = Image, Music, Text |
publication-date = 1997 | isbn = 0006861350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words and language of a text itself determine and expose meaning for Barthes, and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production. Every line of written text is a mere reflection of references from any of a multitude of traditions, or, as Barthes puts it, &quot;the text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture&quot;; it is never original.&lt;ref name=&quot;barthes&quot;/&gt; With this, the perspective of the author is removed from the text, and the limits formerly imposed by the idea of one authorial voice, one ultimate and universal meaning, are destroyed. The explanation and meaning of a work does not have to be sought in the one who produced it, &quot;as if it were always in the end, through the more or less transparent allegory of the fictioni, the voice of a single person, the author 'confiding' in us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barthes&quot;/&gt; The psyche, culture, fanaticism of an author can be disregarded when interpreting a text, because the words are rich enough themselves with all of the traditions of language. To expose meanings in a written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author, their tastes, passions, vices, is, to Barthes, to allow language to speak, rather than author.

Michel Foucault argues in his essay ''&quot;What is an author?&quot;'' (1969), that all authors are writers, but not all writers are authors. He states that &quot;a private letter may have a signatory&amp;mdash;it does not have an author&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;foucault&quot;&gt;{{Citation |

editor-last = Harari |
editor-first = Josué V. |
title = Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist Criticism |
publisher = Cornell University Press |
place = Ithaca, NY |
publication-date = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a reader to assign the title of author upon any written work is to attribute certain standards upon the text which, for Foucault, are working in conjunction with the idea of &quot;the author function&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;foucault&quot;/&gt; Foucault's author function is the idea that an author exists only as a function of a written work, a part of its structure, but not necessarily part of the interpretive process. The author's name &quot;indicates the status of the discourse within a society and culture&quot;, and at one time was used as an anchor for interpreting a text, a practice which Barthes would argue is not a particularly relevant or valid endeavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;foucault&quot;/&gt;

Expanding upon Foucault's position, [[Alexander Nehamas]] writes that Foucault suggests &quot;an author [...] is whoever can be understood to have produced a particular text as we interpret it&quot;, not necessarily who penned the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |
last = Nehamas |
first = Alexander |
title = What An Author Is |
journal = The Journal of Philosophy |
volume = 83 |
issue = 11 |
pages = 685–691 |
publisher = Eighty-Third Annual Meeting American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division |date=November 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this distinction between producing a written work and producing the interpretation or meaning in a written work that both Barthes and Foucault are interested in. Foucault warns of the risks of keeping the author's name in mind during interpretation, because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation.

Literary critics Barthes and Foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work, because of the complications inherent with a writer's title of &quot;author.&quot; They warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice. Instead, readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as &quot;author.&quot;

==Relationship between author and publisher==
The publisher of a work might receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price and or a fixed amount on each book that is sold. Publishers, at times, reduced the risk of this type of arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain amount of copies had sold. In Canada this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s.

*Commissioned: Publishers made publication arrangements, and authors covered all expenses (today the practice of authors paying for their publications is often called [[vanity publishing]], and is looked down upon by many [[publishers]], even though it may have been a common and accepted practice in the past). Publishers would receive a percentage on the sale of every copy of a book, and the author would receive the rest of the money made.

==Relationship between author and editor==
The relationship between the author and the [[Book editor|editor]], often the author’s only liaison to the publishing company, is often characterized as the site of tension. For the author to reach his or her audience, the work usually must attract the attention of the editor. The idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s essay “The Field of Cultural Production” depicts the publishing industry as a “space of literary or artistic position-takings,” also called the “field of struggles,” which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. “The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.” The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu claims that the “field of position-takings [...] is not the product of coherence-seeking intention or objective consensus,” meaning that an industry characterized by position-takings is not one of harmony and neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. “The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.” The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 34&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for the writer, their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity, and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity. However, it is the editor who has “the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer”.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. “The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.” The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 42&lt;/ref&gt; As “cultural investors,” publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in “cultural capital” which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. “The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.” The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the studies of James Curran, the system of shared values among editors in Britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors’ expectations, removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act. Even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership’s reception.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, James. “Literary Editors, Social Networks and Cultural Tradition.” Media Organizations in Society. James Curran, ed. London: Arnold, 2000, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Good relationships between authors and editors are largely found to be the product of an awareness of writing as a social act, and an effort to create a balance wherein the authority over the text is negotiated among all of the positions in the industry, so that the meaning is effectively carried from the meaning-maker to the readership.

== Compensation ==
A standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties. An advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication. An advance must be earned out before royalties are payable. And advance may be paid in two lump sums: the first payment on contract signing, and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication.

An author's contract may specify, for example, that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold. Some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example, where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales, but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds).

An author's book must earn out their advance before any further royalties are paid. (For example, if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000.00, and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20.00 - that is, $2.00 per book - the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made. Publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns.

In some countries, authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the ELR (Educational Lending Right) and PLR (Public Lending Right) schemes in Australia. Under these schemes, authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries.

These days, many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements, school visits, residencies, grants, and teaching positions.

Ghostwriters, technical writers, and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way: usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales.

'''Andrey (Andrei) Andreyevich Markov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Андреевич Марков}}) (June 14, 1856 [[New Style|N.S.]]&amp;nbsp;– July 20, 1922) was a [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]]. He is best known for his work on theory of [[stochastic process]]es.  His research later became known as [[Markov chain]]s.

He and his younger brother [[Vladimir Andreevich Markov]] (1871–1897) proved [[Markov brothers' inequality]].
His son, another [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Andrey Andreevich Markov]] (1903–1979), was also a notable mathematician, making contributions on [[constructive mathematics]] and [[recursive function]] theory.

== Biography ==
Andrey Andreevich Markov was born in [[Ryazan]] as the son of the secretary of the public forest management of Ryazan, Andrey Grigorevich Markov, and his first wife Nadezhda Petrovna Markova.

In the beginning of the 1860s Andrey Grigorevich moved to St Petersburg to become an asset manager of the princess Ekaterina Aleksandrovna Valvatyeva.

In 1866 Andrey Andreevich's school life began with his entrance into Saint Petersburg's fifth grammar school. Already during his school time Andrey was intensely engaged in higher mathematics. As a 17-year-old grammar school student he informed [[Viktor Bunyakovsky|Bunyakovsky]], [[Aleksandr Korkin|Korkin]] and [[Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev|Yegor Zolotarev]] about an apparently new method to solve linear ordinary differential equations and was invited to the so-called Korkin Saturdays, where Korkin's students regularly met.  In 1874 he finished the school and began his studies at the physico-mathematical faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg University]].

Among his teachers were [[Yulian Vasilievich Sokhotski|Yulian Sokhotski]] (differential calculus, higher algebra), [[Konstantin Posse]] (analytic geometry), Yegor Zolotarev (integral calculus), [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]] (number theory, probability theory), [[Aleksandr Korkin]] (ordinary and partial differential equations), [[Okatov]] (mechanism theory), [[Osip Somov]] (mechanics) and [[Budaev]] (descriptive and higher geometry).

In 1877 he was awarded the gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem &quot;About Integration of Differential Equations by Continuous Fractions with an Application to the Equation &lt;math&gt; (1+x^2) \frac{dy}{dx} = n (1+y^2).&lt;/math&gt;&quot;  In the following year he passed the candidate examinations and remained at the university to prepare for the lecturer's position.

In April 1880 Markov defended his masters thesis &quot;About Binary Quadratic Forms with Positive Determinant&quot;, which was encouraged by Aleksandr Korkin and Yegor Zolotarev.

Five years later, in January 1885, there followed his doctoral thesis &quot;About Some Applications of Algebraic Continuous Fractions&quot;.

His [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] work began after the defense of his master thesis in autumn 1880. As a [[privatdozent]] he lectured on differential and integral calculus. Later he lectured alternately on &quot;introduction to analysis&quot;, probability theory (succeeding Chebyshev who had left the university in 1882) and calculus of differences. From 1895/96 until 1905 he also lectured on differential calculus.

One year after the defense of his doctoral thesis, he was appointed extraordinary professor (1886) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the Academy of Sciences. In 1890, after the death of Viktor Bunyakovsky, Markov became extraordinary member of the academy. His promotion to an ordinary professor of St Petersburg University followed in autumn 1894.

In 1896, he was elected ordinary member of the academy as the successor of [[Chebyshev]]. In 1905 he was appointed merited professor and got the right to retire which he immediately used. Till 1910, however, he continued to lecture calculus of differences.

In connection with student riots in 1908, professors and lecturers of Saint Petersburg University were ordered to observe their students. Markov initially refused to accept this decree and wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an &quot;agent of the governance&quot;.  Markov was rejected from a further teaching activity at the Saint Petersburg University, and he eventually decided to retire from the university.

In 1913 the council of Saint Petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university.
Markov was among them, but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education. The affirmation was done only four years later, after the February revolution in 1917.   Markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured probability theory and calculus of differences until his death in 1922.

== Excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church ==
In 1912 Markov in protest to [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s excommunication from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] requested that he too be excommunicated. As such Markov was formally excommunicated from the Church.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Basharin, A.N. Langville, and V.A. Naumov [http://decision.csl.uiuc.edu/~meyn/pages/Markov-Work-and-life.pdf The Life and work of A.A. Markov.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|[[Edvard Munch]] tried to represent &quot;an infinite scream passing through nature&quot; in ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893)]]

'''''Angst''''' is an [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for [[fear]], or [[anxiety]]. (''[[Anguish]]'' is its [[Romance languages|Latinate]] [[cognate|equivalent]], and ''anxious,'' ''anxiety'' are of similar origin.) It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety or inner turmoil. The term ''Angst'' distinguishes itself from the word ''Furcht'' ([[German language|German]] for &quot;fear&quot;) in that  ''Furcht'' usually refers to a material threat (arranged fear), while ''Angst'' is usually a nondirectional emotion.{{Dubious|Incorrect German translation|date=September 2010}}

In other languages having the meaning of the Latin word ''pavor'', the derived words differ in meaning, e.g. as in the French ''anxiété'' and ''peur''.  The word ''Angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*anghu-'', &quot;restraint&quot; from which [[Old High German]] ''angust'' developed. It is pre-cognate with the Latin ''angustia'', &quot;tensity, tightness&quot; and ''angor'', &quot;choking, clogging&quot;; compare to the Greek &quot;άγχος&quot; (ankhos): stress.

==Existentialism==
[[existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers use the term &quot;angst&quot; with a different connotation. The use of the term was first attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813&amp;ndash;1855). In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (also known as ''The Concept of Dread'', depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word ''Angest'' (in common Danish, ''angst'', meaning &quot;dread&quot; or &quot;anxiety&quot;) to describe a profound and deep-seated [[spirituality|spiritual]] condition of insecurity and fear in the free [[human being]]. Where the animal is a slave to its instincts but always conscious in its own actions, Kierkegaard believed that the freedom given to people leaves the human in a constant fear of failing his/her responsibilities to [[God]]. Kierkegaard's concept of angst is considered to be an important stepping stone for 20th-century [[existentialism]]. While Kierkegaard's feeling of angst is fear of actual responsibility to [[god (monotheism)|God]], in modern use, angst was broadened by the later existentialists to include general frustration associated with the conflict between actual responsibilities to self, one's principles, and others (possibly including God). [[Martin Heidegger]] used the term in a slightly different way.
[[File:Marl Gerdes.JPG|thumb|[[Ludger Gerdes]], ''Angst,'' 1989]]
==Classical music==
Angst in serious musical composition has been a reflection of the times. Musical composition embodying angst as a primary theme have primarily come from European Jewish composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Alban Berg]], written during the period of great persecution of the Jewish people shortly before and during the period of [[Nazi]] activity in Europe. A notable exception is the Russian composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] whose symphonies use the theme of angst in post-[[World War II]] compositions depicting Russian strife during the war. However, it is the Jewish artists, Gustav Mahler and [[Franz Kafka]] in music and literature that have embraced the theme of angst so highly in their work that they have become synonymous with the term to the point of popular joking and cartoons today.

Angst appears to be absent from important French music. [[Erik Satie]]’s ''[[Gymnopédie]]'' and [[Maurice Ravel]]’s ''[[Pavane pour une infante défunte]]'', composed before World War II, reflect melancholy sentiment without angst in soft, quiet compositions. The effect of angst is achieved by Shostakovich, Mahler and Berg in compositions of wide dynamic range, at times seemingly spinning out of control (Mahler), and atonal music using the [[twelve-tone row]] method of composition (Berg, Bartok and others) to create an angst ridden atmosphere of grotesque sound. The theme of angst is portrayed in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 6 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 6]] (&quot;The Tragic&quot;) and in Alban Berg's poignant [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] dedicated, &quot;To the memory of an angel&quot;.

'''Anxiety''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] state characterized by [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]], [[emotion]]al,  [[Cognition|cognitive]], and [[behavior]]al components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seligman&quot;&gt;[[Martin Seligman|Seligman, M.E.P.]], Walker, E.F. &amp; [[David Rosenhan|Rosenhan, D.L.]].''Abnormal psychology'', (4th ed.) New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The root meaning of the word anxiety is 'to vex or trouble'; in either the absence or presence of psychological stress, anxiety can create feelings of fear, worry, uneasiness and dread.&lt;ref&gt;Bouras, n. and Holt, G. (2007). ''Psychiatric and Behavioural Disorders in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities'' 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press: UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anxiety is considered to be a [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] reaction to a [[stress (biological)|stressor]]. It may help a person to deal with a difficult situation by prompting one to cope with it.  When anxiety becomes excessive, it may fall under the classification of an [[anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml National Institute of Mental Health] Retrieved September 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity and reasoning behind anxiety determines whether it is considered a normal or abnormal reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Barker|title=Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing: The Craft of Caring|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KsExGQAACAAJ|date=8 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780340947630|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized screening tools such as [[Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale]] can be used to detect anxiety [[symptom]]s, and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment of anxiety disorder. &lt;ref&gt;Zung WWK.

== Description ==
Anxiety is a generalized [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] condition that can often occur without an identifiable triggering [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. As such, it is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an emotional response to a perceived threat. Additionally, fear is related to the specific behaviors of [[Fight-or-flight response|escape]] and avoidance, whereas anxiety is related to situations perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Ohman, A. (2000). Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives. In M. Lewis &amp; J. M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.). ''Handbook of emotions''. (pp.573-593). New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view defines anxiety as &quot;a future-oriented mood state in which one is ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barlow | first=David H. | year=2002 | month=November | title=Unraveling the mysteries of anxiety and its disorders from the perspective of emotion theory | journal=American Psychologist | pages=1247–63 | url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/55/11/1247.pdf | pmid=11280938 | volume=55 | issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it is a distinction between future vs. present dangers which divides anxiety and fear. A 2011 review of the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sylvers|first=Patrick|coauthors=Jamie Laprarie and Scott Lilienfeld|title=Differences between trait fear and trait anxiety: Implications for psychopathology|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2011|month=February|volume=31|issue=1|pages=122-137|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;, fear and anxiety were differentiated by four domains: motivated direction, temporal focus, specificity of threat, and duration of emotional experience. According to these scientists, fear is defined as facilitating escape from threat, present-focused, geared towards a specific threat, and short-lived. Anxiety, on the other hand, is defined as protecting an animal while approaching a potential threat, is future-focused, broadly focused on a diffuse threat, and long-acting.

Physical effects of anxiety may include [[heart palpitations]], [[muscle weakness]] and tension, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], [[chest pain]], [[shortness of breath]], [[stomach aches]], or [[tension headache|headaches]].
The body prepares to deal with a threat: blood pressure and heart rate are increased, sweating is increased, blood flow to the major muscle groups is increased, and [[immune system|immune]] and [[Digestion|digestive]] system functions are inhibited (the ''[[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]'' response). External signs of anxiety may include pale skin, sweating, trembling, and [[mydriasis|pupillary dilation]]. Someone who has anxiety might also experience it as a sense of dread or panic.
Although [[panic attack]]s are not experienced by every person who has anxiety, they are a common symptom. Panic attacks usually come without warning, and although the fear is generally irrational, the perception of danger is very real. A person experiencing a panic attack will often feel as if he or she is about to die or pass out.

Anxiety does not only consist of physical effects; there are many emotional ones as well.  They include &quot;feelings of apprehension or dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, watching (and waiting) for signs (and occurrences) of danger, and, feeling like your mind's gone blank&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Melinda (2008, June).

Retrieved March 3, 2009, from Helpguide Web site: http://www.helpguide.org/mental/anxiety_types_symptoms_treatment.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as well as &quot;nightmares/bad dreams, obsessions about sensations, [[deja vu]], a trapped in your mind feeling, and feeling like everything is scary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(1987-2008). Anxiety Symptoms, Anxiety Attack Symptoms (Panic Attack Symptoms), Symptoms of Anxiety. Retrieved March 3, 2009, from Anxiety Centre Web site: http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying. &quot;You may...fear that the chest pains [a physical symptom of anxiety] are a deadly heart attack or that the shooting pains in your head [another physical symptom of anxiety] are the result of a tumor or aneurysm. You feel an intense fear when you think of dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can’t get it out of your mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(1987-2008). Anxiety symptoms - Fear of dying. Retrieved March 3, 2009, from Anxiety Centre Web site: http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/fear-of-dying.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior can be affected in the form of withdrawal from situations where unpleasant effects of anxiety have been experienced in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker, P. 2003&quot;&gt;Barker, P. (2003) ''Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing: The Craft of Care''. Edward Arnold, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
It can also be affected in ways which include changes in sleeping patterns, nail biting and increased motor tension, such as foot tapping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker, P. 2003&quot;/&gt;

Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]] is thought to underlie anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosen JB, Schulkin J |title=From normal fear to pathological anxiety |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=325–50 |year=1998 |pmid=9577241 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zald|first=D.H.|year=1997|title=Emotion, olfaction, and the human amygdala: amygdala activation during aversive olfactory stimulation|journal=Proc Nat'l Acad Sci|volume=94|issue=8|pages=4119–24|location=USA|pmid=9108115|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.8.4119|last2=Pardo|first2=JV|pmc=20578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zald|first=D.H.|date=1 February 2002|title=Neural correlates of tasting concentrated quinine and sugar solutions|journal=J.

This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.

The psychologist David H. Barlow of Boston University conducted a study that showed three common characteristics of people suffering from chronic anxiety, which he characterized as &quot;a generalized biological vulnerability,&quot; &quot;a generalized psychological vulnerability,&quot; and &quot;a specific psychological vulnerability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |last=Barlow |first=David H. |last2=Durand |first2=Vincent |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |page=125 |isbn=0534581560}}&lt;/ref&gt; While chemical issues in the brain that result in anxiety (especially resulting from genetics) are well documented, this study highlights an additional environmental factor that may result from being raised by parents suffering from chronic anxiety themselves.

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when selecting to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar-Haim&quot;&gt;Bar-Haim Y, Fox NA, Benson B, Guyer AE, Williams A, Nelson EE, Perez-Edgar K, Pine DS, Ernst M. (2009). Neural correlates of reward processing in adolescents with a history of inhibited temperament. Psychol Sci. 20(8):1009-18. PMID 19594857&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note &quot;a sense of ‘responsibility,’ or self agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar-Haim&quot;/&gt;

Although single genes have little effect on complex traits and interact heavily both [[epistasis|between themselves]] and with the external factors, research is underway to unravel possible molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety and comorbid conditions. One candidate gene with [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s that influence anxiety is [[PLXNA2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17339520&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wray NR, James MR, Mah SP, Nelson M, Andrews G, Sullivan PF, Montgomery GW, Birley AJ, Braun A, Martin NG |title=Anxiety and comorbid measures associated with PLXNA2 |journal=[[Arch.

== Clinical scales ==
{{See|Beck Anxiety Inventory}}

The HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Scale) &lt;ref&gt;Psychiatric Times. [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/clinical-scales/anxiety/ Clinically Useful Psychiatric Scales: HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Scale)]. Accessed on March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a widely used interview scale that measures the severity of a patient's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview.

== Varieties ==
===  Anxiety as a medical symptom or condition ===
{{Main|Anxiety disorder}}
Anxiety can be a symptom of an underlying health issue such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, or heart arrythmia.&lt;ref name=&quot;npsreview&quot;&gt;NPSPractice Review 48: Anxiety disorders (2009) Available at http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/prescribing_practice_review/current/prescribing_practice_review_48&lt;/ref&gt;
Abnormal and pathological anxiety or fear itself may be a  medical condition that falls under the blanket term &quot;anxiety disorder.&quot; Such conditions came under the aegis of psychiatry at the end of the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00036-1 |author=Berrios GE |title=Anxiety Disorders: a conceptual history |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=56 |issue=2–3 |pages=83–94 |year=1999 |pmid=10701465}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current psychiatric diagnostic criteria recognize several specific forms of the disorder. Recent surveys have found that as many as 18% of Americans may be affected by one or more of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Merikangas KR, Walters EE |title=Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of 12-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=617–27 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15939839 |pmc=2847357 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.617 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/62/6/617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential anxiety ===

{{See|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]],'' described anxiety or dread associated with the &quot;dizziness of freedom&quot; and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of  responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety&lt;ref name=&quot;Tillich&quot;&gt;[[Paul Tillich|Tillich, Paul]], (1952). ''The Courage To Be'', New Haven: Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-08471-4&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing&quot; and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods.  Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self_acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to &quot;drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]&quot; even though such &quot;undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]&quot;.

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the &quot;trauma of nonbeing&quot; as death is near.

===Test and performance anxiety===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Educational psychology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Test anxiety|Mathematical anxiety|Stage fright|Somatic anxiety}}
According to [[Yerkes-Dodson law]], an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who had a fear of failing an [[Test (student assessment)|exam]]. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of [[Grade (education)|grades]] with [[Self-esteem|personal worth]]; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of [[Social alienation|alienation]] from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control.  Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia.

While the term &quot;test anxiety&quot; refers specifically to students, many workers share the same experience with regard to their career or profession. The fear of failing at a task and being negatively evaluated for failure can have a similarly negative effect on the adult.

=== Stranger and social anxiety ===
{{Main|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}
Anxiety when meeting or interacting with unknown people is a common stage of development in young people. For others, it may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia.  &quot;[[Stranger anxiety]]&quot; in small children is ''not'' a phobia. Rather it is a developmentally appropriate fear by toddlers and preschool children of those who are not parents or family members. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,&lt;ref&gt;Cutting, P., Hardy, S. and Thomas, B. 1997 ''Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice'' Mosby, London.&lt;/ref&gt; social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be being judged negatively.
[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. Whilst for some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (Embracing, Shaking Hands, etc), in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. There can be a tendency among those suffering from this condition to restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social Anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]].

=== Trait anxiety ===
Anxiety can be either a short term 'state' or a long term &quot;trait.&quot; Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency to respond with state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html | title = Anxiety | last = Schwarzer | first = R. | date = December 1997 | accessdate = 2008-01-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the personality trait of [[neuroticism]]. Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Giddey, M. and Wright, H. ''Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice'' Stanley Thornes Ltd. UK.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Choice or decision anxiety ===

Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organisations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article3778818.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Premium choice anxiety | date=April 27, 2008 | accessdate=April 25, 2010 | first1=Jonathan | last1=Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/Gates26.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Today we’re all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uk.capgemini.com/news/pr/pr1487/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paradoxical anxiety ===
{{further|[[Health applications and clinical studies of meditation#Adverse effects|Adverse effects of meditation]]}}
Paradoxical anxiety is anxiety arising from use of methods or techniques which are normally used to reduce anxiety.  This includes relaxation or meditation techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The anxiety &amp; phobia workbook |edition=4th |publisher=New Harbinger Publications |last=Bourne |first=Edmund J. |year=2005 |page=369 |isbn=1572244135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as use of certain medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1037/0022-006X.51.2.171| title=Relaxation-Induced Anxiety: Paradoxical Anxiety Enhancement Due to Relaxation Training |last=Heide |first=Frederick J. |last2=Borkovec |first2=T. D. |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |year=1983 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=171–82| pmid=6341426}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Buddhist meditation literature, this effect is described as something which arises naturally and should be turned toward and mindfully explored in order to gain insight into the nature of emotion, and more profoundly, the nature of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe9.html | title = Mindfullness in Plain English - The threefold Guidance | last = Gunaratana | first = Henepola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anxiety in positive psychology ===
{{Mental state}}
In [[positive psychology]], anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finding Flow&quot;&gt;[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi, M.]], ''Finding Flow,'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Alexander &quot;A. A.&quot; Milne''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|ɪ|l|n}}; 18 January 1882 &amp;ndash; 31 January 1956) was an [[English people|English]] [[author]], best known for his books about the [[teddy bear]] [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and for various children's poems. Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.

==Life==
A. A. Milne was born in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], London, to parents Vince Milne and Sarah Marie Milne (née Heginbotham) and grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, a small [[independent school (UK)|public school]] run by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNBthwaite&quot; /&gt; One of his teachers was [[H. G. Wells]] who taught there in 1889–90.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22657 | year = 1989 | title = Hampstead: Education | journal = A History of the County of Middlesex | volume = 9 | pages = 159–169 | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milne attended [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Venn|id=MLN900AA|name=Milne, Alan Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied on a mathematics scholarship.  While there, he edited and wrote for ''[[Granta]]'', a student magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNBthwaite&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thwaite|first=Ann|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=January 2008|chapter=Milne, Alan Alexander (1882–1956)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor.

Milne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] and later, after a debilitating illness, the [[Royal Corps of Signals]]. He was discharged on February 14, 1919.

After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled ''[[Peace with Honour]]'' (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's ''[[War with Honour]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNBthwaite&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capitalization as in the [[British Library]] Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English  writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]], who was captured at his country home in France by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near [[treason]] by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne &quot;was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theparisreview.com/media/3773_WODEHOUSE.pdf |title=The Art of Fiction - P.G.

He married Dorothy &quot;Daphne&quot; de Sélincourt in 1913, and their only son, [[Christopher Robin Milne]], was born in 1920. In 1925, A. A. Milne bought a country home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520#|title=Cotchford Farm|work=National Monument Records|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During World War II, A. A. Milne was Captain of the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] in Hartfield &amp; Forest Row, insisting on being plain 'Mr. Milne' to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid and by August 1953 &quot;he seemed very old and disenchanted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Letter La Z 5 July 1917 - [[John Middleton Murry]] to [[Beatrice Elvery]] |date=1953-08-12 |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/lss/services/mss/collections/online-mss-catalogues/cats/laz4-5cat.html#laz57 |publisher=George Lazarus Collection |accessdate=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
===1903 to 1925===
After graduating from Cambridge in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to ''Punch'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Milne | first = A. A. | authorlink = A. A. Milne | year = 1904 | month = August | title = Lillian's Loves | journal = [[Punch (magazine)|Punch, or the London Charivari]] | volume = 127 | issue = 24 August 1904 | pages = 142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Milne | first = A.

During this period he published 18 plays and 3 novels, including the murder mystery ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (1922).  His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children's poems ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'', which were illustrated by ''Punch'' staff cartoonist [[E. H. Shepard]].  A collection of short stories for children ''[[Gallery of Children]]'', and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.

Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]]).  These were ''The Bump'', starring [[Aubrey Smith]] ; ''Twice Two''; ''Five Pound Reward''; and ''Bookworms''&lt;ref&gt;Eforgan, E. (2010) ''Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor''.  London: Vallentine Mitchell; chapter 3.  ISBN 978-0-85303-971-6&lt;/ref&gt;
.  Some of these films survive in the archives of the [[British Film Institute]].  Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milne’s play ''Mr Pim Passes By''  in London.

Looking back on this period (in 1926) Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a &quot;''Punch'' humorist&quot; was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that &quot;the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory ''con amore'' as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RedHouseMystery_Intro&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Milne |first=Alan Alexander |title=[[The Red House Mystery]] |origyear=1922 |year=1926 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |location=London  |pages=ix-xii |chapter=Introduction (dated April 1926) |accessdate=2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1926 to 1928===
[[File:The original Winnie the Pooh toys.jpg|thumb|right|The real stuffed toys owned by Christopher Robin Milne and featured in the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' stories. They are on display in the [[Stephen A. Schwarzman Building]] (formerly the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]]) in New York.]]
Milne is most famous for his two ''Pooh'' books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]] after his son, and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed bear, originally named &quot;Edward&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nypl.org/locations/tid/36/node/5557 Winnie-the-Pooh at the New York Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; was renamed &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; after a Canadian [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named [[Winnipeg bear|Winnie]] (after Winnipeg), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to [[London Zoo]] during the war. &quot;The pooh&quot; comes from a swan called &quot;Pooh&quot;. [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy, Growler (&quot;a magnificent bear&quot;), as the model. Christopher Robin Milne's own toys are now under glass in New York.

''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' was published in 1926, followed by ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'' in 1928. A second collection of nursery rhymes, ''[[Now We Are Six]]'', was published in 1927. All three books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also &quot;gallantly stepped forward&quot; to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse's ''A Damsel in Distress''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from P. G. Wodehouse dated 26 July 1928 at page 114 in [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9L2kjKQ8CvYC&amp;pg=RA3-PA1116&amp;lpg=RA3-PA1116&amp;dq=%22A+Damsel+In+Distress%22+Milne&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mcJQgKojgc&amp;sig=QuZS0UJZJtqor9nPDBFzAAKbL5k&amp;hl=en#PRA3-PA1114,M1 P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master] by David A. Jasen (2002). ISBN 0-8256-7275-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''The World of Pooh'' won the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] in 1958.

===1929 onwards===
The success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war ''Punch'' from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[J. M. Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in [[The Red House Mystery]] (although this was severely criticised by [[Raymond Chandler]] for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, &quot;said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words&quot; (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play (&quot;God help it&quot;) was simply &quot;Christopher Robin grown up...what an obsession with me children are become!&quot;.

Even his old literary home, ''Punch'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography ''The Enchanted Places'', although Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).

He also adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, could not survive translation to the theatre.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahame's novel.

Several of Milne's children's poems were set to music by the composer [[Harold Fraser-Simson]]. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books ''When We Were Rather Older'' and ''Now We Are Sixty''.

After Milne's death, his widow sold the rights to the Pooh characters to [[the Walt Disney Company]], which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise.

Royalties from the Pooh characters paid by Disney to the [[Royal Literary Fund]], part-owner of the Pooh copyright, provide the income used to run the Fund's Fellowship Scheme, placing professional writers in U.K. universities.

==Religious views==
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the army:  &quot;In fighting Hitler&quot;, he wrote, &quot;we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief—call it what you will—than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.&quot;

'''Asociación Alumni''', usually just '''Alumni''', is a [[rugby union]] and former [[Association football]] sports club from the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] district of [[Buenos Aires]] in [[Argentina]]. The club was founded in 1891, with the name '''Buenos Aires English High School''' changing their name to '''Alumni Athletic Club''' in 1901. The club disbanded in 1911 then reformed in 1951 as a [[Rugby union]] club.

Since then, Alumni have played at the highest level of Argentinian rugby and their rivalry with [[Belgrano Athletic Club]] is one of the fiercest [[Local derby|local derbies]] in [[Buenos Aires]].
