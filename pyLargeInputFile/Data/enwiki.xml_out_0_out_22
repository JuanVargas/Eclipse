'''Amerigo Vespucci''' (March 9, 1454{{ndash}}February 22, 1512) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[explorer]], navigator and [[cartographer]]. The [[Americas]] are generally believed to have [[Americas#Naming|derived their name]] from the [[Grammatical gender|feminized]] [[Latin]] version of his [[given name|first name]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online, ''Amerigo Vespucci''; and Room, Adrian. 2004. Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for over 5000 natural features, countries, capitals, territories, cities and historic sights: ''America'' believed to have [[Americas#Naming|derived their name]] from the [[Grammatical gender|feminized]] [[Latin]] version of his [[given name|first name]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rival explanations have been proposed (see  Arciniegas, Germán. ''Amerigo and the New World: The Life &amp; Times of Amerigo Vespucci''. Translated by Harriet de Onís. New York: Octagon Books, 1978.{{specify|date=November 2010}}&lt;!--page?--&gt;) For example, some have speculated that the name's origin may lie with [[Richard Amerike]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/americaname_03.shtml], or with the region [[Amerrique]] in [[Nicaragua]]. None of these theories has been accepted in mainstream academia yet.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expeditions==
[[File:Birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci · HHWIX645.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration of the birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci]]
Amerigo Vespucci was born and brought up by his uncle in the [[Republic of Florence]], in what is now Italy. 

Vespucci worked for [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and his son, [[Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giovanni]].  In 1492 he was sent to work at the [[Seville]], [[Spain]] branch of the [[Medici bank]].

At the invitation of king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of [[South America]] between 1499 and 1502. Manuel's commander [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], on his way to the Cape of Good Hope and India in 1500, had discovered [[Brazil]] at latitude 16°52'S. Portugal claimed this land by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], and the King wished to know whether it was merely an island or part of the continent that Spanish explorers had encountered further north.

Vespucci, having already been to the Brazilian shoulder, seemed the person best qualified to go as an observer with the new expedition Manuel was sending. Vespucci did not command at the start - the Portuguese captain was probably [[Gonçalo Coelho]] - but ultimately took charge at the request of the Portuguese officers. Vespucci, in all probability, voyaged to America at the time noted, but he did not have command and as yet had no practical experience piloting a ship. On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.

The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a world map on which he named the new continent [[Americas|America]] after Vespucci's first name, Amerigo. In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset [[Christopher Columbus]]' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci, primarily the Soderini Letter, has led to the view that the early published accounts could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.

In 1503 Vespucci sailed in [[Portugal|Portuguese]] service again to Brazil, but this expedition failed to make new discoveries. The fleet broke up, the Portuguese commander's ship disappeared, and Vespucci could proceed only a little past Bahia before returning to Lisbon in 1504. He did not sail again, and as there seemed no more work for him in Portugal he returned to Seville, where he settled permanently and where he had earlier married Maria de Cerezo. He was middle-aged, and the fact that there were no children might indicate that Maria was also past her youth.

==Historical role==
Columbus never thought Vespucci had tried to steal his laurels, and in 1505 he wrote his son, Diego, saying of Vespucci, &quot;It has always been his wish to please me; he is a man of good will; fortune has been unkind to him as to others; his labors have not brought him the rewards he in justice should have.&quot;

In 1508, after only two voyages to the Americas, the position of chief of navigation of Spain (''piloto mayor de Indias'') was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.

Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. ''Mundus Novus'' (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from [[Lisbon]] to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501-1502. ''Mundus Novus'' was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.&lt;ref name=formisano&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio. ISBN 0-941419-62-2. Pp. xix-xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi'' (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as ''Lettera al Soderini'' or just ''Lettera'', was a letter in Italian addressed to [[Piero Soderini]]. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in 1507 in ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', a book on [[cosmography]] and [[geography]], as ''Quattuor Americi Vespuccij navigationes'' (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).&lt;ref name=formisano/&gt;

In 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).

In the 18th century three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered. One describes a voyage made in 1499-1500 which corresponds with the second of the &quot;four voyages&quot;. Another was written from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.`&lt;ref name=formisano/&gt;

Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci.
It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led [[Martin Waldseemüller]] to name the new continent [[Americas|America]] on his world map of 1507 in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. Vespucci used a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinised]] form of his name, '''Americus Vespucius''', in his [[Latin]] writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form ''America'', according to the prevalent view (for other hypotheses, see the footnote in the introduction). The book accompanying the map stated: &quot;I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women&quot;. ''Amerigo'' itself is an [[Italian language|Italian]] form of the medieval Latin ''Emericus'' (see also [[Emeric of Hungary (saint)|Saint Emeric of Hungary]]), which through the [[German language|German]] form [[Heinrich]] (in [[English language|English]], [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]) derived from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] name ''[[Haimirich]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Amerigo&lt;/ref&gt;

The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited mainland the first time. Some historians like German Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Perez think that his first voyage was done in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.
Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication. He died on February 22, 1512 in Seville, Spain, of an unknown cause.

==Voyages==
[[File:Domenico ghirlandaio, amerigo vespucci, ognissanti, Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Amerigo Vespucci, part of the ''Madonna della Misericordia'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] at the Ognissanti church in Florence]]

===First Voyage===
A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498.  However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html |title=Life of Amerigo Vespucci |publisher=Millersville.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of [[hammock]]s and [[sweat lodge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497vespucci%2Damerica.html |title=Account of alleged 1497 voyage |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Voyage===
About the 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with [[Alonso de Ojeda]] (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1961 | pages = 106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hitting land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing [[Trinidad]] and the [[Orinoco River]] and returning to Spain by way of [[Hispaniola]]. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially
&lt;ref name=Vcelest&gt;
   on a rainy and stormy day with calm seas, stars could be identified
   near the horizon to judge [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]
   celestially. Although [[South America]]'s [[continental shelf]]
   drops quickly into the deep ocean beyond the [[Orinoco River]],
   the mouth is on the shelf, avoiding the ocean swells
   and waves which hinder visibility of stars near the
   horizon.  Seamen who could navigate from Europe to America
   and back could chart stars on the horizon, especially
   for a [[cartographer]] like Vespucci.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,&lt;ref name=Vcelest/&gt; which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.

===Third voyage===
The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] in 1501–1502 in the service of [[Portugal]]. Departing from [[Lisbon]], the fleet sailed first to [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] where they met two of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s ships returning from [[India]]. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499-1500 voyage.&lt;ref name=OGorman/&gt; On reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed south along the coast of [[South America]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of [[Patagonia]] before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]], which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day [[Cananéia]] at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.

After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]], as well as the [[constellation]] [[Crux]], the Southern Cross.&lt;ref name=Vcelest/&gt; Although these [[star]]s had been known to the ancient [[Greece|Greeks]], gradual [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] had lowered them below the [[Europe]]an horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to d'Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by Ptolemy or Marco Polo and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].

===Fourth voyage===
Little is known of his last voyage in 1503–1504 or even whether it actually took place.

==Notes==
:{{note label|4th|a|a}}Europeans had long conceptualized the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].  Once [[cosmographer]]s realized that the [[New World]] was not connected to the [[Old World|Old]] (but before its true [[geography]] was fully [[map]]ped), they considered the [[Americas]] to be a single, fourth [[continent]].

'''Aristide Maillol''' or '''Aristides Maillol''' (December 8, 1861&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 1944) was a French [[Catalans|Catalan]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and [[Painting|painter]].

==Biography==
Maillol was born in [[Banyuls-sur-Mer]], [[Roussillon]]. He decided at an early age to become a painter, and moved to [[Paris]] in 1881 to study art. After several applications, his enrollment in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] was accepted in 1885, and he studied there under [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]]. His early paintings show the influence of his contemporaries [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Paul Gauguin]].

Gauguin encouraged his growing interest in decorative art, an interest that led Maillol to take up [[tapestry]] design. In 1893 Maillol opened a tapestry workshop in Banyuls, producing works whose high technical and aesthetic quality gained him recognition for renewing this art form in France. He began making small [[terracotta]] sculptures in 1895, and within a few years his concentration on sculpture led to the abandonment of his work in tapestry.&lt;!--removed this because I can't find any source supporting it: Studied under the renowned teacher [[Antoine Bourdelle]]--&gt;

The subject of nearly all of Maillol's mature work is the female body, treated with a [[Classicism|classical]] emphasis on stable forms. The figurative style of his large bronzes is perceived as an important precursor to the greater simplifications of [[Henry Moore]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]], and his serene classicism set a standard for European (and [[United States|American]]) figure sculpture until the end of [[World War II]].

His important public commissions include a 1912 commission for a monument to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], as well as numerous war memorials commissioned after [[World War I]]. 

Maillol served as a juror with [[Prix Blumenthal#Florence Meyer Blumenthal|Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]] (1919–1954) a grant awarded to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;FMBlumenthal&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/blumenthal-florence-meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Banyuls at the age of eighty-three, in an automobile accident. While driving home during a thunderstorm, the car in which he was a passenger skidded off the road and rolled over. A large collection of Maillol's work is maintained at the [[Musée Maillol]] in [[Paris]], which was established by [[Dina Vierny]], Maillol's model and platonic companion during the last 10 years of his life. His home a few kilometers outside Banyuls, also the site of his final resting place, has been turned into a museum where a number of his works and sketches are displayed.

Three of his bronzes grace the grand staircase of the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City: ''Summer'' (1910–11), ''Venus Without Arms'' (1920), and'' Kneeling Woman: Monument to Debussy'' (1950–55). The third is the artist's only reference to music, created for a monument at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s birthplace.

Maillol “spoke Catalan, wore traditional espadrilles, a sash and a barretina (the traditional Catalan cap), he danced sardanes” and he openly proclaimed his Catalan identity: “I consider Catalonia my true homeland”.&lt;ref&gt;Maguí Noguer, catalogue of the exhibition ''Fascination for Greece'', Museu d’Art de Girona, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antonio Canova Selfportrait 1792.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait by Canova in 1792]]
'''Antonio Canova''' (1 November 1757 – 13 October 1822) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] who became famous for his [[marble sculpture]]s that delicately rendered [[nudity|nude]] flesh. The epitome of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style, his work marked a return to [[Classicism|classical]] refinement after the theatrical excesses of [[Baroque sculpture]].

==Early life in Possagno and Venice==
Antonio Canova was born in [[Possagno]], a village of the [[Republic of Venice]] situated amid the recesses of the hills of [[Asolo]], where these form the last undulations of the [[Venetian Alps]], as they subside into the plains of [[Treviso]]. At three years of age Canova was deprived of both parents, his father dying and his mother remarrying. Their loss, however, was compensated by the tender solicitude and care of his paternal grandfather and grandmother, the latter of whom lived to experience in her turn the kindest personal attention from her grandson, who, when he had the means, gave her an asylum in his house at [[Rome]].
[[Image:Asolo-Museum Canoviano.JPG|thumb|The ''Museo Canoviano'' located in Possagno near [[Asolo]]]]
His father and grandfather followed the occupation of stone-cutters or minor statuaries; and it is said that their family had for several ages supplied Possagno with members of that calling. As soon as Canova's hand could hold a pencil, he was initiated into the principles of drawing by his grandfather Pasino. The latter possessed some knowledge both of drawing and of architecture, designed well, and showed considerable taste in the execution of ornamental works. He was greatly attached to his art; and upon his young charge he looked as one who was to perpetuate, not only the family name, but also the family profession.

The early years of Canova were passed in study. The bias of his mind was to sculpture, and the facilities afforded for the gratification of this predilection in the workshop of his grandfather were eagerly improved. In his ninth year he executed two small shrines of [[Carrara marble]], which are still extant. Soon after this period he appears to have been constantly employed under his grandfather. Amongst those who patronized the old man was the patrician family [[Falier]] of [[Venice]], and by this means young Canova was first introduced to the senator of that name, who afterwards became his most zealous patron.

Between the younger son, Giuseppe Falier, and the artist a friendship commenced which terminated only with life. The senator Falier was induced to receive him under his immediate protection. It has been related by an Italian writer and since repeated by several biographers, that Canova was indebted to a trivial circumstance - the moulding of a lion in butter - for the warm interest which Falier took in his welfare. The anecdote may or may not be true. By his patron Canova was placed under Bernardi, or, as he is generally called by filiation, [[Giuseppe Torretto]], a sculptor of considerable eminence, who had taken up a temporary residence at Pagnano, one of [[Asolo]]'s boroughs
in the vicinity of the senator's mansion.

This took place whilst Canova was in his thirteenth year; and with Torretto he continued about two years, making in many respects considerable progress. This master returned to Venice, where he soon afterwards died; but by the high terms in which he spoke of his pupil to Falier, the latter was induced to bring the young artist to Venice, whither he accordingly went, and was placed under a nephew of Torretto. With this instructor he continued about a year, studying with the utmost assiduity.

After the termination of this engagement he began to work on his own account, and received from his patron an order for a group, ''[[Orpheus and Eurydice (sculpture)|Orpheus and Eurydice]]''. The first figure, which represents Eurydice in flames and smoke, in the act of leaving [[Hades]], was completed towards the close of his sixteenth year. It was highly esteemed by his patron and friends, and the artist was now considered qualified to appear before a public tribunal.

The kindness of some monks supplied him with his first workshop, which was the vacant cell of a monastery. Here for nearly four years he labored with the greatest perseverance and industry. He was also regular in his attendance at the academy, where he carried off several prizes. But he relied far more on the study and imitation of nature. A large portion of his time was also devoted to anatomy, which science was regarded by him as the secret of the art. He likewise frequented places of public amusement, where he carefully studied the expressions and attitudes of the performers. He formed a resolution, which was faithfully adhered to for several years, never to close his eyes at night without having produced some design. Whatever was likely to forward his advancement in sculpture he studied with ardour. On archaeological pursuits he bestowed considerable attention. With ancient and modern history he rendered himself well acquainted and he also began to acquire some of the continental languages.

Three years had now elapsed without any production coming from his chisel. He began, however, to complete the group for his patron, and the ''[[Orpheus]]'' which followed, evinced the great advance he had made. The work was universally applauded, and laid the foundation of his fame. Several groups succeeded this performance, amongst which was that of ''[[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]]'', the most celebrated work of his noviciate. The terseness of style and the faithful imitation of nature which characterized them called forth the warmest admiration. His merits and reputation being now generally recognized, his thoughts began to turn from the shores of the [[Adriatic]] to the banks of the [[Tiber]], for which he set out at the commencement of his twenty-fourth year.

==Career in Rome==

Before his departure for Rome, his friends had applied to the Venetian senate for a pension, to enable him to pursue his studies without embarrassment. The application was ultimately successful. The stipend amounted to three hundred ducats (about 60 pounds per annum), and was limited to three years. Canova had obtained letters of introduction to the Venetian ambassador, the Cavaliere Zulian, and enlightened and generous protector of the arts, and was received in the most hospitable manner.

[[Image:Canova - Theseus &amp; Minotaur.jpg|thumb|Theseus and the Minotaur, [[V&amp;A]], [[London]]]]
His arrival in Rome, on 28 December 1780, marks a new era in his life. It was here he was to perfect himself by a study of the most splendid relics of antiquity, and to put his talents to the severest test by a competition with the living masters of the art. The result was equal to the highest hopes cherished either by himself or by his friends. The work which first established his fame at Rome was ''[[Theseus]] Vanquishing the [[Minotaur]]'', now in the collections of the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], in [[London]]. The figures are of the heroic size. The victorious Theseus is represented as seated on the lifeless body of the monster. The exhaustion which visibly pervades his whole frame proves the terrible nature of the conflict in which he has been engaged. Simplicity and natural expression had hitherto characterized Canova's style; with these were now united more exalted conceptions of grandeur and of truth. The Theseus was regarded with fervent admiration.

Canova's next undertaking was a monument in honor of [[Clement XIV]]; but before he proceeded with it he deemed it necessary to request permission from the Venetian senate, whose servant he considered himself to be, in consideration of the pension. This he solicited, in person, and it was granted. He returned immediately to Rome, and opened his celebrated studio close to the Via del Babuino. He spent about two years of unremitting toil in arranging the design and composing the models for the tomb of the pontiff. After these were completed, other two years were employed in finishing the monument, and it was finally opened to public inspection in 1787. The work, in the opinion of enthusiastic ''dilettanti'', stamped the author as the first artist of modern times.

[[Image:Theseus_and_Centaur.jpg|thumb|Theseus Fighting the Centaur (1804-1819), [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]. Napolean ordered it for the Corso in Milan; Emperor Franz I bought it for the Theseus Temple in the Volksgarten in Vienna; moved to Kunsthistorisches Museum in 1891.]]
After five years of incessant labor, he completed another [[cenotaph]], to the memory of [[Clement XIII]], which raised his fame still higher. Works now came rapidly from his chisel. Amongst these is ''[[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]]'', with a butterfly, which is placed on the left hand, and held by the wings with the right. This figure, which is intended as a personification of man's immaterial part, is considered as in almost every respect the most faultless and classical of Canova's works. In two different groups, and with opposite expression, the sculptor has represented ''[[Cupid]]'' with his bride; in the one they are standing, in the other recumbent. These and other works raised his reputation so high that the most flattering offers were sent to him from the Russian court to induce him to remove to [[St Petersburg]], but these were declined, although many of his finest works made their way to the [[Hermitage Museum]]. &quot;Italy&quot;, says he, in writing of the occurrence to a friend, &quot;Italy is my country - is the country and native soil of the arts. I cannot leave her; my infancy was nurtured here. If my poor talents can be useful in any other land, they must be of some utility to Italy; and ought not her claim to be preferred to all others?&quot;

Numerous works were produced in the years 1795-1797, of which several were repetitions of previous productions. One was the celebrated group representing the ''Parting of Venus and Adonis.'' This famous production was sent to [[Naples]]. The [[French Revolution]] was now extending its shocks over Italy; and Canova sought obscurity and repose in his native Possagno. Thither he retired in 1798, and there he continued for about a year, principally employed in painting, of which art also he had some knowledge. Events in the political world having come to a temporary lull, he returned to Rome; but his health being impaired from arduous application, he took a journey through a part of [[Germany]], in company with his friend Prince Rezzonico. He returned from his travels much improved, and again commenced his labors with vigour and enthusiasm.

==Trips to France and England==
[[Image:Canova-Magdalene 45 degree view.jpg|thumb|''Magdalen'', Hermitage]]
The events which marked the life of the artist during the first fifteen years of the period in which he was engaged on the above-mentioned works scarcely merit notice. His mind was entirely absorbed in the labors of his studio, and, with the exception of his journeys to [[Paris]], one to [[Vienna]], and a few short intervals of absence in [[Florence]] and other parts of Italy, he never quit Rome. In his own words, &quot;his statues were the sole proofs of his civil existence.&quot;

[[Image:Antonio Canova by Sir GH 1817 - British Embassy, Paris.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Canova in 1817 by [[George Hayter]] (British Embassy, Paris)]] There was, however, another proof, which modesty forbade him to mention, an ever-active benevolence, especially towards artists. In 1815 he was commissioned by the Pope to superintend the transmission from Paris of those works of art which had formerly been conveyed thither under the direction of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. By his zeal and exertions - for there were many conflicting interests to reconcile - he adjusted the affair in a manner at once creditable to his judgment and fortunate for his country.

In the autumn of this year he gratified a wish he had long entertained of visiting [[London]], where he received the highest tokens of esteem. The artist for whom he showed particular sympathy and regard in London was [[Benjamin Haydon]], who might at the time be counted the sole representative of historical painting there, and whom he especially honored for his championship of the [[Elgin marbles]], then recently transported to England, and ignorantly depreciated by polite connoisseurs. Among Canova's [[England|English]] pupils were sculptors Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] and [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]].

Canova returned to Rome in the beginning of 1816, with the ransomed spoils of his country's genius. Immediately after, he received several marks of distinction: he was made President of the Accademia di San Luca, the main artistic institution in Rome, and by the hand of the Pope himself his name was inscribed in &quot;the Golden Volume of the Capitol&quot;, and he received the title of Marquis of [[Ischia]], with an annual pension of 3000 crowns.

==Last projects==
[[Image:Canova tomb.jpg|thumb|Monument to Canova in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]], designed by Canova as a [[mausoleum]] for the painter [[Titian]]]]

He now contemplated a great work, a colossal statue of ''Religion''. The model filled Italy with admiration; the marble was procured, and the chisel of the sculptor ready to be applied to it, when the jealousy of churchmen as to the site, or some other cause, deprived the country of the projected work. The mind of Canova was inspired with the warmest sense of devotion, and though foiled in this instance he resolved to consecrate a shrine to the cause. In his native village he began to make preparations for erecting a temple which was to contain, not only the above statue, but other works of his own; within its precincts were to repose also the ashes of the founder. Accordingly he repaired to Possagno in 1819. After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno, in order to direct the workmen, and encourage them with pecuniary rewards and medals.

In the meantime the vast expenditure exhausted his resources, and compelled him to labor with unceasing assiduity notwithstanding age and disease. During the period which intervened between commencing operations at Possagno and his decease, he executed or finished some of his most striking works. Amongst these were the group ''Mars and Venus'', the colossal figure of [[Pius VI]], the [[Pietà]], the ''St John'', the recumbent ''[[Magdalen]]''. The last performance which issued from his hand was a colossal bust of his friend, the Count Cicognara.

In May 1822 he paid a visit to Naples, to superintend the construction of wax moulds for an equestrian statue of the perjured Bourbon king [[Ferdinand VII]]. This journey materially injured his health, but he rallied again on his return to Rome. Towards the latter end of the year he paid his annual visit to the place of his birth, when he experienced a relapse. He proceeded to Venice, and expired there at the age of nearly sixty-five. His disease was one which had affected him from an early age, caused by the continual use of carving-tools, producing a depression of the ribs. The most distinguished funeral honors were paid to his remains, which were deposited in the temple at Possagno on 25 October 1822. His heart was interred in a marble pyramid he designed as a [[mausoleum]] for the painter [[Titian]] in the church of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in Venice, now a monument to the sculptor.

==Notable works==
[[File:Perseus Canova Pio-Clementino Inv969.jpg|thumb|''[[Perseus and the head of Medusa]]'' by Antonio Canova]]
Among Canova's heroic compositions, his ''[[Perseus with the Head of Medusa]]'' (photo, right) appeared soon after his return from Germany. The moment of representation is when the hero, flushed with conquest, displays the head of the &quot;snaky Gorgon&quot;, whilst the right hand grasps a sword of singular device. By a public decree, this fine work was placed in one of the stanze of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] hitherto reserved for the most precious works of antiquity.

[[Image:Apsley House - Napoleon's statue.JPG|thumb|upright|left|''Napoleon'' by Antonio Canova, [[Apsley House|Apsley House, London]]]]

In 1802, at the personal request of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], Canova returned to Paris to model a bust of the first consul. The artist was entertained with munificence, and various honors were conferred upon him. The statue, which is colossal and entitled ''[[Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker]]'', was not finished till four years after. On the fall of the great emperor, [[Louis XVIII]] presented this statue to the British government, by whom it was afterwards given to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].

[[File:Canova-Washington.JPG|thumb|upright|right||&quot;Washington&quot; on display at the [[North Carolina Museum of History]]]]

''Palamedes,'' ''Creugas and Damoxenus,'' the ''Combat of Theseus and the Centaur,'' and ''Hercules and Lichas'' may close the class of heroic compositions, although the catalogue might be swelled by the enumeration of various others, such as ''Hector and Ajax,''  King Ferdinand of Naples, and others.  Canova's marble statue  [[George Washington]]  was commissioned by the State of [[North Carolina]] after the war of 1812 to be displayed in its [[North Carolina State Capitol|Capitol Building]].  The work was finished 9 years later and transported via warship, steamship, and finally mule train before being dedicated on Christmas Eve.

Under the head of compositions of grace and elegance, the statue of ''Hebe'' takes the first place in point of date. Four times has the artist embodied in stone the goddess of youth, and each time with some variation. The last one is in the Museum of [[Forlì]], in [[Italy]]. The only material improvement, however, is the substitution of a support more suitable to the simplicity of the art. Each of the statues is, in all its details, in expression, attitude and delicacy of finish, strikingly elegant. [[Image:VenusVictrix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pauline Bonaparte]] as [[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]], now at the [[Galleria Borghese]]]]

[[Image:Frith, Francis (1822-1898) - n. 2340 - Tomb of Marie Christine by Canova - Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cenotaph to [[Maria Christina of Austria]] in the [[Augustinerkirche]], by Canova]]

The ''Dancing Nymphs'' maintain a character similar to that of the ''Hebe''. ''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]'' and the ''Venus'' are more elevated. The ''Awakened Nymph'' is another work of uncommon beauty. The mother of Napoleon, his consort Maria Louise (as ''Concord''), to model whom the author made a further journey to Paris in 1810, the princess Esterhazy and the muse Polymnia ([[Elisa Bonaparte]]) take their place in this class, as do the ideal heads, comprising ''Corinna'', ''Sappho'', ''Laura'', ''Beatrice'' and ''Helen of Troy''.

Of the cenotaphs and funeral monuments the most splendid is the monument to the archduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen, consisting of nine figures.

Besides the two for the [[Roman Pontiff]]s already mentioned, there is one for [[Alfieri]], another for Emo, a Venetian admiral, and a small model of a cenotaph for [[Horatio Nelson]], besides a great variety of monumental relieves such as the Stele Tadini in the Chapel of the [[Accademia Tadini]] in [[Lovere]].

[[George Anthony Legh Keck]] was known to have collected some of Antonio Canovas sculptures and had them on display at his jacobean mansion house of [[Bank Hall]] in Bretherton. After the death of Legh Keck in 1860 the sculptures where auctioned off, their whereabouts is unknown.

'''François-Auguste-René Rodin''' (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as '''Auguste Rodin''' ({{IPA-en|oʊˈɡuːst roʊˈdæn}} {{respell|oh|GOOST|'}} {{respell|roh|DAN|'}}, {{IPA-fr|ogyst ʁɔdɛ̃}}), was a French [[Sculpture|sculptor]]. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition,&lt;ref name=&quot;H76&quot;&gt;Hale, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.

Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in [[clay]]. Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with the predominant figure sculpture tradition, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of [[mythology]] and [[allegory]], modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive of the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.

From the unexpected realism of his first major figure—inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy—to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|World's Fair]] exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his life-long companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculpture suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades his legacy solidified.  Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.

==Biography==
===Formative years===
[[File:Auguste Rodin signature.jpg|alt=Artist's signature is raised above the surface of a sculpture.|right|thumb|250px|Rodin's signature on ''[[The Thinker]]'']]

Rodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk. He was largely self-educated,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;(François) Auguste (René) Rodin.&quot; ''International Dictionary of Art and Artists''. St. James Press, 1990. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the ''Petite École'', a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting&lt;!--with Belloc--&gt;. His drawing teacher, [[Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; There he first met [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Alphonse Legros]].

Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the ''[[École des Beaux-Arts|Grand École]]'' in 1857 in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytobit&quot;/&gt; Given that entrance requirements at the ''Grand École'' were not particularly high,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the ''Petite École'' in 1857, Rodin would earn a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.

Rodin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of [[peritonitis]] in a convent in 1862. Her brother was anguished, and felt guilty because he had introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, Rodin briefly joined a Catholic order. Father [[Peter Julian Eymard]] recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor [[Antoine-Louis Barye]]. The teacher's attention to detail&amp;mdash;his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion&amp;mdash;significantly influenced Rodin.&lt;ref name=&quot;morey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morey|first=C. R.|title=The Art of Auguste Rodin|journal=The Bulletin of the College Art Association of America|volume=1|issue=4|year=1918|pages=145–154|doi=10.2307/3046338|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3046338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named Rose Beuret, with whom he would stay&amp;mdash;with ranging commitment&amp;mdash;for the rest of his life. The couple bore a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934).&lt;ref&gt;Date of death from Elsen, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]], a successful mass producer of ''[[objets d'art]]''. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Rodin was called to serve in the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], but his service was brief due to his [[near-sightedness]].&lt;ref&gt;Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family—poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30.&lt;ref name = &quot;tabhhj&quot;&gt;Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in [[Belgium]], where they would work on ornamentation for [[Brussels Stock Exchange|Brussels' bourse]].

Rodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years abroad. It was a pivotal time in Rodin's life.&lt;ref name = &quot;tabhhj&quot;/&gt; He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop, since Rodin could not afford castings. Though his relationship with Carrier-Belleuse deteriorated, he found other employment in Brussels, displayed some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodin said, &quot;It is [[Michelangelo]] who has freed me from academic sculpture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Belgium, he began work on ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'', a life-size male figure whose realism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheating.

===Artistic independence===

Rose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. The charges of fakery surrounding ''The Age of Bronze'' continued. Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.

Rodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and [[neo-baroque]] architectural pieces in the style of Carpeaux.&lt;ref name=&quot;j638&quot;&gt;Janson, 638.&lt;/ref&gt; In competitions for commissions he submitted models of [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Lazare Carnot]], all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, ''St. John the Baptist Preaching''.

In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse—now art director of the [[Sèvres]] national [[porcelain]] factory—offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to [[Paris Salon]]s by such friends as writer [[Léon Cladel]]. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy;&lt;ref name=&quot;H71&quot;&gt;Hale, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman [[Leon Gambetta]] expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including Edmund Turquet, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.&lt;ref name=&quot;H71&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Camille Claudel.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders of a young, dark haired woman looking downward.|thumb|upright|right|[[Camille Claudel]] (1864–1943)]]

Rodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate ''[[Gates of Hell]]'', an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, ''[[The Thinker]]'' and ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]''. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.

In 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor [[Alfred Boucher]] in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old [[Camille Claudel]]. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions.

Although busy with ''The Gates of Hell'', Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of [[Calais]]. For a monument to French author [[Honoré de Balzac]], Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.

In 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's &quot;double life&quot;. Claudel and Rodin shared an [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] at a small old castle, but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, &quot;I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices…I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- no source: He never fulfilled a contract with Claudel to give up all contact with other women and marry her.--&gt; Claudel and Rodin parted in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(1) Camille Claudel|publisher=Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press|url=http://www.groveart.com/shared/views/article.html?section=art.018005.1|author=Ward-Jackson, Philip|accessdate=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudel suffered a nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution by her family until her death.

==Works==
In 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, ''The Man with the Broken Nose'', to the [[Paris Salon]]. The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter. The unconventional [[bronze]] piece was not a traditional [[bust (sculpture)|bust]], but instead the head was &quot;broken off&quot; at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the &quot;unfinishedness&quot; that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 637.&lt;/ref&gt; The Salon rejected the piece.

[[File:Rodin The bronze age.jpg|alt=Life-sized nude stature of a male on a  pedestal on display in a museum.|thumb|upright|''[[The Age of Bronze]]'' (1877)]]

===Early figures: the inspiration of Italy===
In Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'', having returned from Italy. Modelled by a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's ''[[Dying Slave]]'', which Rodin had observed at the [[Louvre]]. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.

In 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics—commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event—and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; He first titled the work ''The Vanquished'', in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on ''The Age of Bronze'', suggesting the [[Bronze Age]], and in Rodin's words, &quot;man arising from nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;&gt;Hale, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind &quot;just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;/&gt;

Its mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so realistic that Rodin was accused of ''surmoulage''—having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to &quot;a statue of a sleepwalker&quot; and called it &quot;an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;/&gt; Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and ''The Age of Bronze'' was purchased by the state for 2,200 [[franc]]s—what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.&lt;ref name=&quot;H51&quot;/&gt;

[[File:St-John-the-Baptist-Preaching.jpg|alt=Nude man holding is hand out, as if explaining a point.|thumb|upright|left|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'' (1878)]]

A second male nude, ''St. John the Baptist Preaching'', was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of ''surmoulage'' by making the statue larger than life: ''St. John'' stands almost 6' 7&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (2&amp;nbsp;m). While ''The Age of Bronze'' is statically posed, ''St. John'' gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground—a physical impossibility, and a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, &quot;display simultaneously…views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;H68&quot;&gt;Hale, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the title, ''St. John the Baptist Preaching'' did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of [[John the Baptist]], and carried that association into the title of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;H68&quot;/&gt; In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.&lt;ref name=&quot;H68&quot;/&gt;

Regardless of the immediate receptions of ''St. John'' and ''The Age of Bronze'', Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of ''surmoulage''. The artistic community knew his name.

===''The Gates of Hell''===
[[File:Zürich - Kunsthaus - Rodin's Höllentor IMG 7384 ShiftN.jpg|alt=Ornate, bronze door panels and frame showing figures and scenes in relief.|thumb|upright|''[[The Gates of Hell]]'' (unfinished), [[Musée Rodin]]]]
A commission to create a [[Gate|portal]] for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;j638&quot;/&gt; Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on ''[[The Gates of Hell]]'', a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;elsen35&quot;&gt;Elsen, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived ''The Gates'' with the ''surmoulage'' controversy still in mind: &quot;…I had made the ''St. John'' to refute [the charges of casting from a model], but it only partially succeeded. To prove completely that I could model from life as well as other sculptors, I determined…to make the sculpture on the door of figures smaller than life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;elsen35&quot;/&gt; Laws of composition gave way to the ''Gates''' disordered and untamed depiction of Hell. The figures and groups in this, Rodin's meditation on the condition of man, are physically and morally isolated in their torment.&lt;ref name = &quot;qgzhpg&quot;&gt;Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gates of Hell'' comprised 186 figures in its final form.&lt;ref name = &quot;qgzhpg&quot;/&gt; Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition,&lt;ref name=&quot;morey&quot;/&gt; such as ''[[The Thinker]]'', ''The Three Shades'', and ''The Kiss'', and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from ''The Gates'' are ''[[Ugolino della Gherardesca|Ugolino]]'', ''Fugit Amor'', ''The Falling Man'', and ''The Prodigal Son''.

''The Thinker'' (originally titled ''The Poet'', after Dante) was to become one of the most well-known sculptures in the world. The original was a {{convert|27.5|in|mm|sing=on}}-high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the ''Gates''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[lintel]], from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While ''The Thinker'' most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical [[Adam]], the mythological [[Prometheus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;j638&quot;/&gt; and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alhadeff&quot;/&gt; Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of ''The Thinker'', stressing the figure's rough physicality and the emotional tension emanating from it.&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 42, 46, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The.burg.of.calais.london.arp.750pix.jpg|alt=See adjacent text.|thumb|left|''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'' (1884–c. 1889) in [[Victoria Tower Gardens]], London, England]]

===''The Burghers of Calais''===
The town of Calais had contemplated an historical monument for decades when Rodin learned of the project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens. During the [[Hundred Years' War]], the army of [[King Edward III]] besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's population be killed ''en masse''. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], begged him to spare their lives. ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'' depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.

Rodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by [[Jean Froissart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;swedberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swedberg|first=Richard|title=Auguste Rodin's ''The Burghers of Calais'': The Career of a Sculpture and its Appeal to Civic Heroism|journal=Theory, Culture, &amp; Society|volume=22|issue=2|pages=45–67|year=2005|doi=10.1177/0263276405051665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the town envisioned an [[allegorical]], heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.

In 1889, ''The Burghers of Calais'' was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing two tons (1,814&amp;nbsp;kg), and its figures are 6.6&amp;nbsp;ft (2&amp;nbsp;m) tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;swedberg&quot;/&gt; The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front;&lt;ref name=&quot;apollo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stocker, Mark|title=A simple sculptor or an apostle of perversion?|journal=Apollo|pages=94–97|volume=164|issue=537|month=November | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument's high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could &quot;penetrate to the heart of the subject&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; At ground level, the figures' positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 115&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having ''Burghers'' displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's most well-known and acclaimed works.&lt;ref name=&quot;swedberg&quot;/&gt;

===Commissions and controversy {{Anchor|Balzac}}===
[[File:Auguste Rodin - Monument to Victor Hugo.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rodin observing work on the monument to Victor Hugo at the studio of his assistant Henri Lebossé in 1896]]

Commissioned to create a monument to French writer [[Victor Hugo]] in 1889, Rodin dealt extensively with the subject of ''artist and muse''. Like many of Rodin's public commissions, ''Monument to Victor Hugo'' was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, ''[[The Times]]'' in 1909 expressed that &quot;there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M. Rodin and French Sculpture.|publisher=The Times|date=4 October 1909|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1897 plaster model was not cast in bronze until 1964.

The ''Société des Gens des Lettres'', a Parisian organization of writers, planned a monument to French novelist [[Honoré de Balzac]] immediately after his death in 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a [[frock coat]], or in a [[robe]]—a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work&lt;ref name=&quot;times1711&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Auguste Rodin. His Sculpture And Its Aims.|publisher=The Times|date=19 November 1917|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to express courage, labor, and struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monument to Balzac.jpg|thumb|left|''Monument to Balzac'' (1891–1898)]]
When ''Balzac'' was exhibited in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;bell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Millicent|title=Auguste Rodin|journal=Raritan|volume=14|pages=1–31|year=Spring 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Société'' rejected the work, and the press ran [[parodies]]. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, &quot;there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem ''outre'' to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;morey&quot;/&gt; A modern critic, indeed, indicates that ''Balzac'' is one of Rodin's masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schor|first=Naomi|title=Pensive Texts and Thinking Statues: Balzac with Rodin|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=2001|volume=27|issue=2|pages=239–264|doi=10.1086/449007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument had its supporters in Rodin's day; a manifesto defending him was signed by [[Monet]], [[Debussy]], and future [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Georges Clemenceau]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than try to convince skeptics of the merit of the monument, Rodin repaid the ''Société'' his commission and moved the figure to his garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was ''Monument to Balzac'' cast in bronze.

===Other works===
The popularity of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments over more than five decades. He painted in [[Oil painting|oils]] (especially in his thirties) and in [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]]. The Musée Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in [[chalk]] and [[charcoal]], and thirteen vigorous [[drypoint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early Drawings by Auguste Rodin|author=Varnedoe, Kirk|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=116|issue=853|month=April|year=1974|pages=197–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced a single [[lithograph]].

Portraiture was an important component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rodin and His English Sitters|first=Marion J.|last=Hare|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=129|issue=1011|year=1987|pages=372–381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early subjects included fellow sculptor [[Jules Dalou]] (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884). Later, with his reputation established, Rodin made busts of prominent contemporaries such as English politician [[George Wyndham]] (1905), Irish playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1906), Austrian composer [[Gustav Mahler]] (1909), former Argentinian president [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and French statesman [[Georges Clemenceau]] (1911).

==Aesthetic==
[[File:Rodin p1070095.jpg|thumb|A famous &quot;fragment&quot;: ''The Walking Man'']]

Rodin was a naturalist, less concerned with monumental expression than with character and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|date=14 July 1931|page=12|title=Art Exhibitions: Auguste Rodin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departing with centuries of tradition, he turned away from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the [[Baroque]] and [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-Baroque]] movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.&lt;ref name=&quot;H76&quot;/&gt;

Rodin's talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male's passion in ''The Kiss'' is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;morey&quot;/&gt; Speaking of ''The Thinker'', Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: &quot;What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sculpture/flash/zone2-2.htm|title=NGA Sculpture Galleries: Auguste Rodin|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.|accessdate=12 December 2006|format=[[Adobe Flash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments—perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head—took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples are ''[[The Walking Man]]'', ''Meditation without Arms'', and ''Iris, Messenger of the Gods''.

Rodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. &quot;Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alhadeff&quot;/&gt; [[Charles Baudelaire]] echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer [[Gluck]], and wrote a book about [[List of cathedrals in France|French cathedrals]]. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], and admired the forgotten [[El Greco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;werner&quot;/&gt;

===Method===
[[File:Age of bronze plaster.jpg|thumb|right|A [[plaster]] of ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'']]

Instead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred to work with amateur models, street performers, acrobats, strong men, and dancers. In the atelier, his models moved about and took positions without manipulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;morey&quot;/&gt; Very devoted to his craft, Rodin worked constantly but not feverishly. The sculptor made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and forged into bronze or carved in marble. Rodin was fascinated by dance and spontaneous movement. As France's best-known sculptor, he had a large staff of pupils, craftsmen, and stone cutters working for him, including the Czech sculptors Josef Maratka and Joseph Kratina. Through his method of ''[[marcottage]]'' (layering), he used the same sculptural elements time and time again, under different names and in different combinations. Disliking the formality of [[pedestal]]s, Rodin placed many of his subjects around rough rock to emphasize their immediacy and provide contrast.&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: &quot;While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work.&quot; He described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through &quot;all the stages of art's evolution&quot;: first, a &quot;[[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] masterpiece&quot;, then &quot;[[Bernini]] intermingled&quot;, then an elegant [[Houdon]]. &quot;The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of ''[[Elan Vital (term)|Elan Vital]]''. The ''Hand of God'' is his own hand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jianou &amp; Goldscheider, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Legros -buste de Rodin (dessin).jpg|left|thumb|A portrait of Rodin by his friend [[Alphonse Legros]]]]

By 1900, Rodin's artistic reputation was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 [[World's Fair]] (''Exposition Universelle'') in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally,&lt;ref name=&quot;bell&quot;/&gt; while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totalled probably 200,000 francs a year.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and authors [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;apollo&quot;/&gt; Rilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory [[monograph]] on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in [[Meudon]], purchased in 1897, was a host to such visitors as [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward]], dancer [[Isadora Duncan]], and [[harpsichord]]ist [[Wanda Landowska]]. Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the [[Hôtel Biron]], an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul.&lt;ref name=&quot;julius&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Julius, Muriel|title=Human Emotion Made Tangible - The Work of Auguste Rodin|journal=Contemporary Review|volume=250|issue=1452|year=1987|month=January|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rodin and America===

While Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of ''The Burghers of Calais'', he had not yet conquered the American market and because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists.  Fortunately, he came to know [[Sarah Tyson Hallowell]] (1846–1924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier [[Potter Palmer]] and his wife, [[Bertha Palmer]] (1849–1918). The next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;The Indefatigable Miss Hallowell, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was ''beaucoup moins beau que l'original'' but impossible, outside the rules.  Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection.&lt;ref&gt;Rodin: The Shape of Genius, Page 399&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodin sent Hallowell three works, ''Cupid and Psyche'', ''Sphinx'' and ''Andromeda''.  All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Documented Image, Page 97&quot;&gt;The Documented Image, Page 97&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, ''Bust of Dalou'' and ''Burgher of Calais'' were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed.  However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier [[Charles Yerkes]] (1837–1905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Documented Image, Page 97&quot;/&gt; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Franch, John (2006). ''Robber Baron: The Life of Charles Tyson Yerkes.'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press; p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other collectors soon followed including the tastemaking Potter Palmers of Chicago and [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] (1840–1924) of Boston, all arranged by Sarah Hallowell.  In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta. When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893, she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence, which lasted to the end of the sculptor's life.&lt;ref&gt;Extensive correspondence in Musee Rodin&lt;/ref&gt;  After Hallowell's death, her niece, the painter [[Harriet Hallowell]], inherited the Rodin's &lt;!-- _?___ --&gt; and after her death, the American heirs could not manage to match their value in order to export them, so they became the property of the French state.&lt;ref&gt;The indefatigable Miss Hallowell, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Britain ===

After the turn of the century, Rodin was a regular visitor to Great Britain, where he developed a loyal following by the beginning of the First World War. He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist [[Alphonse Legros]], had introduced him to the poet [[William Ernest Henley]]. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newton|first=Joy|title='Rodin Is a British Institution'|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=136|issue=1101|year=1994|pages=822–828}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a [[:File:HenleyRodin.JPG|bust of Henley]] that was used as the frontispiece to Henley's collected works&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=2aNqbQuwZZcC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=Henley+Rodin&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Dictionary of National Biography'', p.244]&lt;/ref&gt; and, after his death, on his monument in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=2aNqbQuwZZcC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=Henley+Rodin&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Dictionary of National Biography'', p. 246]&lt;/ref&gt;) Through Henley, Rodin met [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Robert Browning]], in whom he found further support.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a significant selection of his works to the nation in 1914.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R38535, Auguste Rodin.jpg|right|thumb|Rodin in 1914]]
After the revitalization of the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in 1890, Rodin served as the body's vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|publisher=Musée Rodin|url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/biotx-e.htm|accessdate=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the [[International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers]]. He replaced its former president, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], upon Whistler's death. His election to the prestigious position was largely due to the efforts of [[Albert Ludovici]], father of English philosopher [[Anthony Ludovici]].

During his later creative years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity.&lt;ref name=&quot;bell&quot;/&gt; He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous [[Erotic art|erotic drawings]], sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. Rodin met American dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] in 1900, attempted to seduce her,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rodin Show Visits Home Of Artist's Muses|author=Kinetz, Erica|publisher=The New York Times|date=27 December 2006|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty-three years into their relationship, Rodin married Rose Beuret. The wedding was 29 January 1917, and Beuret died two weeks later, on 16 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt171117&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Rodin requested permission to stay in the [[Hotel Biron]], a museum of his works, but the director of the museum refused to let him stay there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Art: Rodin's Death | work = Time | date = 24 March 1923 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727018,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Duh!: The Stupid History of the Human Race | first = Bob | last = Fenster | page = 99 | publisher = Andrews McMeel | location = Kansas City | isbn = 0-7407-1002-8 |year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Musee Rodin.jpg|thumb|The grounds of [[Musée Rodin]]]]

Rodin willed to the French state his studio and the right to make casts from his plasters. Because he encouraged the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections.
The [[Musée Rodin]] was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the [[Hôtel Biron]], where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper.
The relative ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: a survey of expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 10 Most Faked Artists|journal=ARTnews|author=Esterow, Milton|month=June|year=2005|accessdate=5 February 2007|url=http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to the conviction of art dealer [[Guy Hain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artclair.com/jda/archives/docs_article/49618/proces-guy-hain-une-decision-qui-fera-jurisprudence.php&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with the complexity of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts—the maximum number that can be made from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', for example, is found in fourteen cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;swedberg&quot;/&gt;

In the market for sculpture, plagued by fakes, the value of a piece increases significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8 million in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Winship, Frederick M.|title=Bogus bronzes flood market: an estimated 4,000 fake castings have put the market for 19th- and 20th-century bronze sculpture in jeopardy|journal=Insight on the News|date=16 September 2002|volume=26|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rodin's bronze ''Eve, grand modele—version sans rocher'' sold for $18.9 million at a 2008 [[Christie's]] auction in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=AFP|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jJ-nuOHmXSBq7_MFQrllsC6jrt4A|title=Monet fetches record price at New York auction|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture—especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The real Rodin|journal=New Criterion|author=Gibson, Eric|year=2005|issue=4|volume=24|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Thinker, Rodin.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Thinker]]'' (1879–1889) is among the most recognized works in all of sculpture.]]

During his lifetime, Rodin was compared to [[Michelangelo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;alhadeff&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Albert|last= Alhadeff|title=Rodin: A Self-Portrait in the Gates of Hell|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=48|issue=3/4|year=1966|pages=393–395|doi=10.2307/3048395|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3048395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rodin Rediscovered|first=John M.|last=Hunisak|journal=Art Journal|volume=41|number=4|year=1981|pages=370–371|doi=10.2307/776450|issue=4|url=http://jstor.org/stable/776450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;/&gt; Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended;&lt;ref name=&quot;werner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Werner, Alfred|title=The Return of Auguste Rodin|journal=Criticism|volume=2|issue=1|year=1960|pages=48–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hand of Rodin|first=Albert Ten Eyck|last=Gardner|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series|volume=15|issue=9|year=1957|pages=200–204|doi=10.2307/3257752|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3257752}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as ''The Walking Man'', influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Though highly honoured for his artistic accomplishments, Rodin did not spawn a significant, lasting school of followers. His notable students included [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Charles Despiau]], the American [[Malvina Hoffman]], and his mistress [[Camille Claudel]], whose sculpture received praise in France. The French order ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' made him a Commander, and he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Oxford]].

Rodin restored an ancient role of sculpture—to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;/&gt;—and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women—to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as ''The Kiss'' and ''The Thinker'', are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodin, (François-)Auguste(-René)|publisher=Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press|url=http://www.groveart.com/shared/views/article.html?section=art.072591|author=Lampert, Catherine|accessdate=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Arbor''' is a city in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]].  The [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] places the population at 113,934, making it the [[List of municipalities in Michigan (by population)|sixth largest city in Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Population of Michigan Cities, Villages, Townships, and Remainders of Townships. www.michigan.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ann Arbor [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) had a population of 344,791 as of 2010. The city is also part of the larger [[Metro Detroit|Detroit – Ann Arbor – Flint, MI]] [[Combined Statistical Area|CSA]].

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, with one theory stating that it is named after the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, pp. 1-2&quot;&gt;Marwil, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Michigan]] moved from [[Detroit]] to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city showed steady growth throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with a decline during the [[Long Depression|Depression of 1873]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a focal-point for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement.

Today, Ann Arbor is home to the [[University of Michigan]], which is the dominant institution of higher learning in the city. The university shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the [[University of Michigan Health System|medical center]]. The city's economy is also centered on [[high technology]], with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | title=Ann Arbor: Introduction | publisher=Advameg, Inc. | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Arbor has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and [[gentrification]], as well as [[urban sprawl]] stretching far into the outlying countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenbelt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2openspace.org/ | title=Ann Arbor Parks and Greenbelt Proposal | date=March 2, 2004 | publisher=Friends of Ann Arbor Open Space | accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Ann Arbor}}
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators [[John Allen (pioneer)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Rumsey]]. On May&amp;nbsp;25, 1824, the town [[plat]] was registered with Wayne County as &quot;Annsarbour&quot;; this represents the earliest known use of the town's name.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name; one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[bur oak|burr oak]] in the {{convert|640|acre|ha}} of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, pp. 1-2&quot;/&gt; Regional Michigan [[Ojibwa]] named the settlement ''kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's [[sawmill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society, Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society|title=Michigan History Magazine|year=1964|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|accessdate=2008-07-31|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and was incorporated as a village in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved from Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837, the history of both the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor are closely linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1824-1859pg3 | title=1824–1859: Education. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824–1974'' | year=2006 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the [[Michigan Central Railroad]], and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and other markets to the south was established in 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, p. 49&quot;&gt;Marwil, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish,&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1824-1859pg6 | title=1824–1859: Government and Growth.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing 15 years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1940-1974pg3 | title=1940–1974: From Protest to Outer Space. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824–1974'' | year=2006 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library| accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the [[Human Rights Party (United States)|Human Rights Party]] (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances, [[Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|measures decriminalizing marijuana possession]], and a [[rent control|rent-control]] ordinance;&lt;ref name=&quot;HRP&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Restivo, Terrence R. | url=http://etd1.library.duq.edu/theses/available/etd-03312006-154729/unrestricted/RestivoThesis.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071201164218/http://etd1.library.duq.edu/theses/available/etd-03312006-154729/unrestricted/RestivoThesis.pdf | archivedate=2007-12-01 | title=The Building of a New Left Conglomerate in the City of Ann Arbor: VOICE, Action Movement and the Human Rights Party (1965–1975) | format=PDF | date=2006-03-22 | publisher=McAnulty College and Graduate School of Liberal Arts, Duquesne University | accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include [[Word of God (community)|Word of God]] (established in 1967), a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] inter-denominational movement;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; and the [[Thomas More Law Center]] (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thomasmore.org/qry/page.taf?id=24 | title=History | publisher=Thomas More Law Center | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 1956 vote the city of East Ann Arbor merged with Ann Arbor to encompass the eastern sections of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsfieldhistory.org/index.php?section=history&amp;content=east_ann_arbor#services|title=Inside the Eastside: History of East Ann Arbor, Michigan (MI)|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, [[gentrification]], and [[urban sprawl]] stretching into outlying countryside. On November&amp;nbsp;4, 2003, voters approved a [[green belt|greenbelt]] plan under which the city government bought development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenbelt&quot; /&gt; Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/ann_arbor_seeks_grants_for_gre.html | title=Ann Arbor seeks grants for greenbelt land | author=McGovern, Judy | date=2009-05-18 | journal=The Ann Arbor News | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the &quot;top places to live&quot; lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year. In 2008, it was ranked 27th out of 100 &quot;America's best small cities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2008/top100/index2.html | title=Best Places to Live—Money's List of America's Best Small Cities | publisher=CNNMoney.com | date=2008–08 | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and cityscape==
[[File:HuronRiverAnnArbor.JPG|thumb|right|The Huron river runs through Ann Arbor]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of {{convert|27.7|mi2|km2|abbr=off|lk=off}}; {{convert|27.0|mi2|km2|abbr=off|lk=off}} is land and {{convert|0.7|mi2|km2|abbr=off|lk=off}} or 2.43% is water, much of which is part of the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. Ann Arbor is about {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} west of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. [[Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan|Ann Arbor Charter Township]] adjoins the city's north and east sides. Ann Arbor is situated on the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]] in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ann Arbor|journal=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of hills and valleys, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about {{convert|750|ft|m|abbr=off|lk=off}} along the Huron River to over {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=off|lk=off}} on the city's west side, near [[I-94]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=42.27083&amp;lon=-83.72639&amp;datum=nad27&amp;zoom=8 | title=Ann Arbor, USGS Ann Arbor East (MI) Topo Map | publisher=United States Geological Survey at TopoQuest | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the west-central and northwestern parts of the city and UM's North Campus are the highest parts of the city; the lowest parts are along the Huron River and in the southeast. Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is south of the city at {{Coord|42|13.38|N|83|44.74|W|region:US}}, has an elevation of {{convert|839|ft|m|abbr=off|lk=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/KARB | title=KARB—Ann Arbor Municipal Airport | publisher=Federal Aviation Administration at Airnav.com| date=2007-03-15 | accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor's &quot;Tree Town&quot; nickname stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city contains more than 50,000 trees along its streets and an equal number in parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.annarbor.org/aboutannarbor/funfacts.asp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060224212952/http://www.annarbor.org/aboutannarbor/funfacts.asp | title=Fun Facts | year=2006 | publisher=Ann Arbor Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau | archivedate=2006-02-24 | accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the [[emerald ash borer]] has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 [[ash tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2007/04/last_of_street_ash_trees_cut_d.html | title=Last of street ash trees cut down | journal=The Ann Arbor News | author=Davis, Tracy | date=2007-04-02 | accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city contains 157 municipal parks ranging from small neighborhood green spots to large recreation areas. Several large city parks and a university park border sections of the Huron River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2gov.org/GOVERNMENT/COMMUNITYSERVICES/PARKSANDRECREATION/PARKS/Pages/Parks.aspx|title=General Parks Information | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller Recreation Area, near the [[University of Michigan Health System|University Hospital]] complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and [[bike path]]s, and swimming pools. [[Nichols Arboretum]], operated by the [[University of Michigan]], is a {{convert|123|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} preserve that contains hundreds of plant and tree species. It is on the city's east side, near the university's central campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?m=9;1&amp;p=G5293 | title=Nichols Arboretum—University of Michigan | publisher=Michigan Economic Development Corporation (Michigan.org) | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ann anbor wshg st.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Night time in downtown, with buildings lit by street lamps|Washington Street, towards Main Street]]
The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown Ann Arbor. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near [[Interstate 94|I-94]] and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, [[Briarwood Mall]], and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side.&lt;ref name=&quot;city development&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/GOVERNMENT/COMMUNITYSERVICES/PLANNINGANDDEVELOPMENT/PLANNING/Pages/MasterPlans.aspx | title=Master Plans—General Information | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown contains a mix of 19th- and early-20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a [[farmers' market]] in the Kerrytown district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/Farmers%20Market/farmers_main.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070518213203/http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/Farmers+Market/farmers_main.html | archivedate=2007-05-18 | title=Ann Arbor Farmers' Market | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's commercial districts are composed mostly of two- to four-story structures, although downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Regional and local performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre, the Arbor Opera Theater, the [[Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra]], the Ann Arbor Ballet Theater, the Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (established in 1954 as Michigan's first chartered ballet company),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sylviastudio.com/civic.htm | title=Ann Arbor Civic Ballet | publisher=Sylvia Studio of Dance – Ann Arbor Civic Ballet | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Ark (folk venue)|The Ark]], and [[Performance Network Theatre]], which operates a downtown theater and frequently offers new or nontraditional plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.performancenetwork.org/about_mission.php | title=About PN—Mission | publisher=Performance Network Theatre | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another unique piece of artistic expression in Ann Arbor is the [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI|fairy doors]]. These small portals are examples of [[installation art]] and can be found throughout the downtown area.

The [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]], located in a renovated and expanded historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. Multiple art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, South State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor ranks first among U.S. cities in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041210170216/ecurrent.com/ag/2003/shop/list.php#boo | title=Ann Arbor Guide 2003–4 | year=2003–2004 | publisher=Ecurrent.com | accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ann Arbor District Library]] maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building.

Several annual events—many of them centered on performing and visual arts—draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the [[Ann Arbor Art Fairs]], a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets, which began in 1960. Scheduled on Wednesday through Saturday in the third week of July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artfair.org/ | title=About—Mission &amp; History | publisher=Ann Arbor Street Art Fair | year=2006 | accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]], held during the third week of March, which receives more than 2,500 submissions annually from more than 40 countries and serves as one of a handful of Academy Award–qualifying festivals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About| url=http://www.aafilmfest.org/about/ |publisher=Ann Arbor Film Festival| accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; One event that is not related to visual and performing arts is [[Hash Bash]], held on the first Saturday of April, ostensibly in support of the reform of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] laws. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the City's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.

Ann Arbor has a major scene for college sports, notably at the University of Michigan, a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]].

For a period during the latter 1960s, the Ann Arbor vicinity acquired a greater recognition globally among certain fans of rock music, as the area included a number of popular groups which originated in Ann Arbor, were frequent visitors of Ann Arbor, or settled in the city or surrounding area. Among these were Detroit transplants [[MC5]], as well as [[The Stooges]], [[SRC (band)|SRC]], [[The Up]], [[The Rationals]] and others. This trend continued with later groups such as [[The Cult Heroes]], although the residual influences of the 1960s trendsetters are still evident in the city today.

A person from Ann Arbor is called an &quot;Ann Arborite&quot;, and many long-time residents call themselves &quot;townies&quot;. The city itself is often called ''A²'' (&quot;A-squared&quot;) or ''A2'' (&quot;A two&quot;), &quot;The Deuce&quot;, &quot;Ace Deuce&quot; and, less commonly, ''Tree Town''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ssw.umich.edu/about/UM-A2.html | title=About U-M SSW—Ann Arbor | publisher=University of Michigan School of Social Work | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to the city's liberal political leanings, some occasionally refer to Ann Arbor as ''The People's Republic of Ann Arbor''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Bakopoulos, Dean | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/apr/04-17-97/week/arts21.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102004715/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/apr/04-17-97/week/arts21.html | archivedate=January 2, 2008 | title=Places I'll remember: A farewell to Ann Arbor | work=The Michigan Daily | date=April 17, 1997 | accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''25 square miles surrounded by reality'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boothnewspapers.com/markets/aa.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060621195124/http://www.boothnewspapers.com/markets/aa.html | archivedate=2006-06-21 | title=Welcome to Ann Arbor | publisher=Booth Newspapers – ''The Ann Arbor News'' | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter phrase being adapted from Wisconsin Governor [[Lee Dreyfus|Lee Dreyfus's]] description of [[Madison, Wisconsin]].

Ann Arbor has a [[Council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government. The mayor, who is elected every even-numbered year, is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The mayor of Ann Arbor is [[John Hieftje]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]), who has served in that capacity since the 2000 election. The city council has ten members, two from each of the city's five wards, with the mayor wielding the tie-breaking vote. Council members serve two-year terms; half the council is elected in annual elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/citycouncil/index.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070513001747/http://www.a2gov.org/citycouncil/index.html | archivedate=2007-05-13 | title=Government | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Council | accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; City operations are managed by the [[City Administrator]], who is chosen by the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/City_Clerk/Documents/charter.pdf | title=Charter for the City of Ann Arbor, Michigan | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | date=1956-04-09 | accessdate=2009-08-24 | format=PDF | pages=9, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Left-wing politics have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have [[Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|lessened the penalties]] for possession of marijuana (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ann Arbor Votes $5 Fine for the Use of Marijuana | journal=The New York Times | date=April 3, 1974 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aim to protect access to [[abortion]] in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marshall, Steve | title=City Hopes to Thwart Michigan on Abortion Law | journal=USA Today | date=February 14, 1990 | pages=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Kathy Kozachenko]]'s victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly [[homosexuality|homosexual]] candidate to win public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cohen-Vrignaud, Gerard | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/feb/02-12-99/news/news18.html | title=Gay and Proud | journal=The Michigan Daily | date=February 12, 1999 | accessdate=August 4, 2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080103130053/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/feb/02-12-99/news/news18.html | archivedate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use [[instant-runoff voting]] for a mayoral race.

The city is belted by three [[freeway]]s: [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]], which runs along the southern portion of the city; [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US 23]], which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]], which runs along the northern edge of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;bessertM14&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= Bessert, Christopher J. | title=Michigan Highways: Highways 10 through 19 | date=2006-04-23 | work=Michigan Highways | url= http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys10-19.html#M-014 | accessdate=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nearby [[highway]]s include [[U.S. Route 12|US 12]], [[M-17 (Michigan highway)|M-17]], and [[M-153 (Michigan highway)|M-153]].

The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 juncture in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;MDOT07&quot;&gt;{{cite map |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |title=Official 2007 Department of Transportation Map |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9622_11033_11151---,00.html |year=2007|scale=1&amp;nbsp;in:15&amp;nbsp;mi/1&amp;nbsp;cm:9&amp;nbsp;km |section= C1–C11 |accessdate=2008-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also has a system of bike routes and [[Segregated cycle facilities|paths]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/images/bike.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070605152004/http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/images/bike.pdf | archivedate=2007-06-05 | title=City of Ann Arbor Bikeway System | year=2007 | publisher=City of Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County | accessdate=2008-08-23|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the nearly complete Washtenaw County [[Border-to-Border Trail|Border-to-Border_Trail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B2B&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Friends of the Border to Border Trail | url=http://www.bordertoborder.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus service===
[[File:AATA Bus.JPG|thumb|alt=A white low-floor city bus on an empty city street|An AATA bus, with the blue-roofed Blake Transit Center in the background.]]
The [[Ann Arbor Transportation Authority]] (AATA), which brands itself as &quot;The Ride&quot;, operates public [[bus]] services throughout Ann Arbor and nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]]. AATA has recently introduced [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric buses]] to its fleet of 69 and is the first public transit operator in the Midwest to state its intention to convert to all hybrid electric buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arborupdate.com/article/1558/aata-goes-hybrid |title=AATA Goes Hybrid | publisher=Arbor Update—''Ann Arbor Area Community News'' | date=October 24, 2007 | accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate [[zero-fare]] bus service operates within the University of Michigan campuses, and the AATA ran a free ''Link Bus'' connecting central campus and downtown during the U-M school year until August 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theride.org/fares.asp | title=Fares | publisher=Ann Arbor Transportation Authority | year=2009 | accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theride.org/rideguide/Link.pdf | title=The Link | publisher=Ann Arbor Transportation Authority | year=2009 | format=PDF | accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/downtown-link-bus-service-proposed-to-end/ | title=Downtown Ann Arbor Link bus service not expected to resume | date=August 8, 2009 | work=News | publisher=AnnArbor.com | author=Reed, Tina | accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A downtown bus depot served by [[Greyhound Lines]] provides out-of-town bus service, and is the city's only remaining example of the [[Streamline Moderne]] architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brandt, Karen L. | url=http://www.daads.org/modern/1802/article07.htm | title=Ann Arbor Bus Depot | journal=The Modern | date=Fall 2005/Winter 2006 | volume=18 | accessdate=August 4, 2008 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] has twice daily direct service to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], while a bus service provided by [[Amtrak]] connects to [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] and [[Toledo, Ohio]], though only for rail passengers making connections. The [[Michigan Flyer]], a service operated by Indian Trails, offers bus service to [[Detroit Metro Airport]], [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], and [[East Lansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.michiganflyer.com/ | title=Michigan Flyer—Home | publisher=Michigan Flyer | year=2009 | accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special bus shuttle service to [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.msa.umich.edu/airbus/&lt;/ref&gt; is available for a low fare before and after university breaks. Another service, Michigan Flyer,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.michiganflyer.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is available regularly.

===Airports===
[[Ann Arbor Municipal Airport]] is a small, city run [[general aviation]] airport located south of [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], the area's large [[international airport]], is about {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} east of the city, in [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fodor's Where to Weekend Around Chicago | edition=1st | year=2004 | publisher=Fodor's | isbn=978-1-4000-1303-6 | page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willow Run Airport]] east of the city near [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] serves freight, corporate, and general aviation clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.willowrunairport.com/ | title=Welcome to Willow Run Airport | publisher=Wayne County Airport Authority | year=2006 | accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railroads===
The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and ports north of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], from 1878 to 1982; however, the [[Ann Arbor Railroad (1895–1976)|Ann Arbor Railroad]] also sold 1.1 million passenger tickets in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/resource_tab/information_and_exhibits/michigan's_ann_arbor_railroads/a_brief_history.html | title=A Brief History | publisher=Central Michigan University—Clarke Historical Library | date=February 5, 2010 | accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was also served by the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] starting in 1837. [[Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Street Railway]], Michigan's first [[interurban]], served the city from 1891 to 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1880-1899pg4 | title=Pictorial History of Ann Arbor 1824–1974 (1880–1899) – Public Transportation and Changes in City Government | date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 23, 2009 |publisher=Ann Arbor District Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amtrak]] provides service to Ann Arbor, operating its [[Wolverine (passenger train)|Wolverine]] three times daily in each direction between Chicago and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], via [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. Rail service is provided at the [[Ann Arbor (Amtrak station)|Ann Arbor Train Station]]; the present-day station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1969.

[[Image:Act of Settlement 3323.jpg|thumb|250px|Act of Settlement]]
The '''Act of Settlement''' is an act of the [[Parliament of England]] that was originally filed in 1700 and passed in 1701 to settle the [[Order of succession|succession]] to the [[List of English monarchs|English throne]] on the [[Electress]] [[Sophia of Hanover]] (a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James I]]) and her [[Protestantism|Protestant]] heirs. The act was later extended to [[Scotland]], as a result of the [[Treaty of Union]] (Article II), enacted in the [[Acts of Union 1707]] before it was ever needed. Along with the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], it remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the [[Line of succession to the British Throne|succession]] to not only the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|throne of the United Kingdom]], but, following [[British Empire|British colonialism]], the resultant [[doctrine of reception]], and independence, also to those of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, whether by willing deference to the act as a British statute or as a [[Patriation|patriated]] part of the particular realm's constitution.&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite web| author=Toporoski, Richard| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| title=Monarchy Canada: The Invisible Crown| date=Summer, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the implementation of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in each of the Commonwealth realms (on successive dates from 1931 onwards), the Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the shared throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1081723 Statute of Westminster; 1931 c.4 22 and 23 Geo 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

The act does not contain a date in its formal title, but today it is generally referred to as the '''Act of Settlement 1701''' (the year in which it was enacted) or the '''Act of Settlement 1700''' (the year in which it was originally filed), the discrepancy arising because of an historic [[regnal year|change]] in the way bills were named.

==Original context==
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]], the line of succession to the English throne was governed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which declared that the flight of [[James II of England|James II]] from England to France during the revolution amounted to an [[abdication]] of the throne and that James' son-in-law,{{clarify|date=March 2011}} [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and his wife, James' daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], were James' successors, who ruled jointly as [[William and Mary|William III and Mary II]]. The Bill of Rights also stated that the line of succession would go through their descendants, then through Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], and her descendents, and then to the issue of William III by a later marriage (if he were to marry again after the death of Mary II).

However, Mary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry, and Princess Anne's last surviving child, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], died six years later, after which it was unlikely she would have any more children due to her age and the large number of miscarriages she had previously suffered. Thus, there was seen a need for a new law that would ensure the continuance of the succession following the death of the last legal heir under the Bill of Rights, being Princess Anne, guaranteeing the line of succession would continue in the Protestant line, and excluding any possible claims by the deposed James II or his son and daughter, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]] and [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart]]. The Act of Settlement was thus passed and granted [[Royal Assent]] in June 1701.

==Provisions of the act==

The Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]]&amp;nbsp;– a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland, I of England]], niece of [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland and England]]&amp;nbsp;– and her [[Protestantism|Protestant]] descendants who had not married a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]; those who were Roman Catholic, and those who married a Roman Catholic, were barred from ascending the throne &quot;for ever&quot;. Eight further provisions of the act would only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:&lt;ref name=&quot;wfitext&quot;&gt;http://www.worldfreeinternet.net/parliament/settlement.htm. Text of the Act of Settlement&lt;/ref&gt;

* The monarch &quot;shall join in communion with the [[Church of England]].&quot; This was another provision to avoid a Roman Catholic monarch. Along with James II's perceived despotism, his religion was the main cause of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the previous linked religious and succession problems solved by the joint monarchy of [[William and Mary]].
* If a person not native to England comes to the throne, England will not wage war for &quot;any dominions or territories which do not belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament.&quot; This was farsighted, because when the [[House of Hanover]] ascended the British throne they would retain the territories that became the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (situated in modern-day [[Germany]]'s [[Lower Saxony]]). This provision has been dormant since [[Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the [[Salic Law]]s of the German states of the day, but in principle it could again become relevant in the future.
* No monarch may leave &quot;the dominions of [[England]], [[Scotland]], or [[Ireland]],&quot; without the consent of Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfitext&quot;/&gt; This provision was repealed in 1716, at the request of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who was also the [[prince-elector|Elector of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and so frequently needed and wanted to stay in Hanover.&lt;ref name=&quot;tarkowp547&quot;&gt;I. Naamani Tarkow, 'The Significance of the Act of Settlement in the Evolution of English Democracy', ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 58, No. 4. (December, 1943), p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All government matters within the jurisdiction of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] were to be transacted there, and all council resolutions were to be signed by those who advised and consented to them. This was because parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent. This provision was repealed early in Queen Anne's reign, as many councillors ceased to offer advice and some stopped attending meetings altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;tarkowp547&quot; /&gt;
* No foreigner, even if naturalised (unless they were born of English parents), shall be allowed to be a Privy Councillor or a member of either House of Parliament, or hold &quot;any office or place of trust, either civil or military, or to have any grant of lands, tenements or hereditaments from the Crown, to himself or to any other or others in trust for him.&quot; As a result of subsequent nationality laws, this provision does not apply to naturalised citizens in any country.{{Vague|date=May 2009}}
* No person who has an office under the monarch, or receives a pension from the Crown, can be a Member of Parliament (MP). This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the House of Commons. It remains in force, but with several exceptions. (As a side effect, this provision means that MPs seeking to resign from parliament can get around the age-old prohibition on resignation by obtaining a low-salary [[sinecure]] in the pay of the Crown; while several offices have been used for this purpose, two are currently in use. Appointments generally alternate between the Stewardships of the [[Chiltern Hundreds]] and the [[Manor of Northstead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |work=House of Commons Information Office |title=The Chiltern Hundreds |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Judges' commissions are valid ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' (during good behaviour), and if they do not behave themselves they can be removed only by both Houses of Parliament, or the one House of Parliament, depending on the legislature's structure. This provision was the result of various monarchs' influencing judges' rulings, and it assured nearly full [[judicial independence]].
* No pardon by the monarch can save someone from being [[Impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Commons.

==Effects of the Act==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2011}}
For different reasons, various [[constitutionalist]]s have praised the Act of Settlement: [[Henry Hallam]] called the act in the United Kingdom &quot;the seal of our constitutional laws,&quot; and [[David Lindsay Keir]] placed its importance above the Bill of Rights 1689.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tarkow, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Naamani Tarkow has written: &quot;If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save [[Magna Carta]] (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tarkow, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of Great Britain===
The Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of [[Scotland]] with [[England and Wales]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement, and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Stemming from this, the [[Parliament of England]] decided that to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death, and used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act of 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve it within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]]. This was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|throne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots Law]] as well.

===Removal from the succession===
Since the passage of the Act of Settlement, the most senior member of the royal family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby been removed from the line of succession, is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who married [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time of his marriage. The current most senior living descendant of the Electress Sophia who is ineligible to succeed due to the act is [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], the eldest son of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who married the Roman Catholic [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988; he would now be 25th in the line of succession if he had not lost his place. His son, [[Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick|Lord Downpatrick]], converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003, and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his own religion. More recently, [[Peter Phillips]], son of [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and eleventh in line to the throne, married [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]]; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to [[Anglicanism]] prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage.

Excluding those princesses who have married into overseas Roman Catholic royal families, only one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'') has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the act: the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], wife of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]]. The Duchess converted to Roman Catholicism on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession, as the Duchess had been an Anglican at the time of their marriage. The Act does not concern itself with wives who later change their religious allegiance. In December 1978, there was media speculation that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles, Prince of Wales]], might marry a Roman Catholic, although the rumours were never verified.

===The abdication of 1936===
Under the Act of Settlement, succession of the senior descendant of the Electress Sophia is automatic and immediate, neither depending on, nor waiting for, any proclamation. Thus, during the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]] of 1936, caused by [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]]'s desire to marry [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]], the consent of all realms concerned, along with, in some cases, new acts of parliament, was required throughout the British Dominions to allow for Edward's stepping aside and to ensure that if he had any children they would have no claim to the thrones. In the United Kingdom, [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936|His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act]] was, with the consent of the [[Australia]]n, [[Canada|Canadian]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Union of South Africa|South African]] governments, passed through Parliament, and the crown thus passed to the next senior descendant of Sophia: Edward's brother, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert, Duke of York]]. The [[Irish Free State]], whose consent to the Abdication Act was also required, neither gave it nor allowed the British legislation to take effect in the Free State's jurisdiction; instead, the Irish parliament passed its own act—the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|Executive Authority (External Relations) Act]]— the day after the Declaration of Abdication Act took force elsewhere, meaning Edward VIII, for one day, remained King of Ireland while George VI was king of all the other realms. To formalise its government's consent to the abdication, the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] passed, the following year, the [[Succession to the Throne Act]] (1 Geo. VI, c.16), and South Africa took a similar course of action.

==Present debate==
Challenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and [[Primogeniture|preference for males]]. However, as the Act of Settlement is a common denominator in the shared succession of all the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, and as the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 requires that any changes to the rules of succession be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments made by each state's parliament, legislating for alterations to the Act is a long and complex process. Further, as the current monarch is a woman and both her eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any move to change the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there has been little public concern with the issues and debate has been confined to largely academic circles. If, however, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] were to father a legitimate daughter and then a legitimate son, new proposals to alter the Act of Settlement are expected to come forward.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], where the Act of Settlement is now a part of [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitutional law]], [[Tony O'Donohue]], a Canadian civic politician, took issue with the provisions that exclude [[Roman Catholic]]s from the throne, and which make the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], requiring him or her to be an [[Church of England|Anglican]]. This, he claimed, discriminated against non-Anglicans, including Catholics, who are the largest faith group in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spector&quot;&gt;[http://www.rbcinvest.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/LAC/20070830/COSPECTOR30/Headlines/headdex/headdexComment/3/3/7/ Spector, Norman; ''The Globe and Mail'': Why Canada must take on Britain over the 1701 Act of Settlement; 30 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, O'Donohue launched [[O'Donohue v. Canada|a court action]] that argued the Act of Settlement violates the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], but the case was dismissed by the court, which found that, as the Act of Settlement is part of the Canadian constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not have supremacy over it. Also, the court pointed out that, while Canada has the power to amend the line of succession to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian throne]], the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] stipulates that the agreement of the governments of the fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s that share the Crown would first have to be sought if Canada wished to continue its relationship with these countries. An appeal of the decision was dismissed on 16 March 2005.

With the announcement in 2007 of the [[engagement]] of [[Peter Phillips]] to [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]], a Roman Catholic, discussion about the Act of Settlement was somewhat reinvigorated. [[Norman Spector]] called, in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', for [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] to address the issue of the Act of Settlement's bar on Catholics, saying that Phillips' marriage to Kelly would be the first time the provisions of the act would bear directly on Canada&amp;nbsp;– Phillips would be barred from acceding to the Canadian throne because he married a Roman Catholic Canadian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spector&quot; /&gt; (This is not the case, however, as [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews|the Earl of St. Andrews]] had already lost his place in the line of succession when he married the Roman Catholic Canadian [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988.)  Criticism of the Act of Settlement due to the Phillips-Kelly marriage was muted when Autumn Kelly converted to the [[Church of England]] shortly before her marriage thus preserving her husband's place in the line of succession.

===United Kingdom===
From time to time there has been debate over repealing the clause that prevents &quot;[[Papist]]s&quot; (Roman Catholics) or those who marry one from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a [[bigoted]] [[anachronism]]; [[Thomas Winning|Cardinal Winning]], who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in [[Scotland]], called the act an 'insult' to Catholics. [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], &quot;can marry by law a Hindu, a Buddhist, anyone, but not a Roman Catholic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm | work=BBC News | title=Let monarchy marry Catholics | date=2 June 2002 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of repeal, such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], feel that it would lead to the disestablishment of the [[Church of England]] as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also point to the fact that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]], but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of [[sovereignty]].

Hilton, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not &quot;irrational prejudice or blind bigotry&quot; but claims that it was passed because &quot;the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost&quot;. He points to the fact that the Pope claims universal jurisdiction and he therefore argues that &quot;it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state&quot; and contends that if such situation came about &quot;we will have undone centuries of common law&quot;. He further asserts that because the Roman Catholic Church [[Apostolicae Curae|does not recognise]] the Church of England as an apostolic church, a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and [[Church of Scotland]] archbishops, bishops and clergy as part of the [[laity]] and therefore &quot;lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments&quot;. (Hilton does mention that the Church of Scotland's [[Presbyterian polity]] does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton also claims a Roman Catholic monarch would therefore be unable to be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and points to the examples of European states that have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]—whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]—and the [[Netherlands]]—the constitution of which insists its monarchs be members of the Protestant House of Orange—and [[Belgium|Belgian]]— which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 | work=The Spectator | title=price of liberty, The | first=Adrian | last=Hilton | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in December 1978 there was media speculation that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] might marry a Roman Catholic, [[Enoch Powell]] defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne. Powell claimed his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He claimed a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and &quot;in the literal sense, foreign to the [[Crown in Parliament]] ... Between Roman Catholicism and [[royal supremacy]] there is, as St [[Thomas More]] concluded, no reconciliation&quot;. Powell concluded that a &quot;Roman Catholic Crown&quot; would be the destruction of the Church of England because &quot;it would contradict the essential character of that church&quot;. He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote that &quot;the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased [[Roman Empire]] sitting crowned upon the grave thereof&quot;, he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that ''imperium'' from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the ''alter imperium'', the &quot;other empire&quot;, of which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] declared &quot;This realm of England is an empire&quot; ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Heffer, ''Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell'' (Phoenix, 1999), pp. 810–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 British general election]] campaign [[Michael Howard]] promised to work towards having the prohibition removed if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] gained a majority of seats in the House of Commons. In any event, the election was won by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Tony Blair]], who made no moves to change this law, despite his own conversion to Catholicism after leaving office.

In 2008 plans drawn up by [[Chris Bryant]] were revealed which would end the exclusion of Catholics from the throne, and end the doctrine of agnatic (male-preference) [[primogeniture]], in favour of absolute primogeniture, which governs succession solely on birth order and not on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1|title=End of the Anglican crown – 300 year bar to be lifted|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|date=2008-09-25|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Newspapers|pages=1|accessdate=2008-09-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Across the realms===
British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament [[Keith Vaz]] introduced to the House of Commons at Westminster, in 2011, a [[private member's bill]], which proposed that the Act of Settlement be amended to remove the provisions relating to Roman Catholicism and change primogeniture governing the line of succession to the British throne from [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] to absolute cognatic. Vaz sought support for his project from the Canadian Cabinet, but the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister of Canada]] responded that the issue was &quot;not a priority for the government or for Canadians without further elaboration on the merits or drawbacks of the proposed reforms.&quot; The [[Monarchist League of Canada]] said to the media that it &quot;supports amending the Act of Settlement in order to modernize the succession rules.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Boswell| first=Randy| title=Brit asks Canada for help rewriting the rules of the Crown| newspaper=The Vancouver Sun| date=21 January 2011| url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Brit+asks+Canada+help+rewriting+rules+Crown/4146719/story.html| accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia|Prime Minister of Saint Lucia]] [[Stephenson King]] said he supported the idea and it was reported that the government of New Zealand did, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Cecil| first=Nicholas| title=St Lucia backs change to laws of succession| newspaper=London Evening Standard| date=8 March 2011| url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23929938-st-lucia-backs-change-to-laws-of-succession.do| accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aircraft hijacking''' (also known as '''skyjacking''' and '''sky controlling''') is the unlawful seizure of an [[aircraft]] by an individual or a group. In most cases, the pilot is forced to fly according to the orders of the hijackers. Occasionally, however, the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves. In at least one case, a plane was hijacked by the official pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Air China pilot hijacks his own jet to Taiwan | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 1998-10-28 | url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9810/28/hijack.china.taiwan.02/index.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080321171516/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9810/28/hijack.china.taiwan.02/index.html |archivedate = 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Raman&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = B. Raman | title = PLANE HIJACKING: IN PERSPECTIVE | publisher = [[South Asia Analysis Group]] | date = 2000-01-02 | url = http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers2%5Cpaper103.html | accessdate = 2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the typical hijackings of land vehicles or ships, skyjacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft. Most aircraft hijackers intend to use the passengers as [[hostage]]s, either for monetary ransom or for some political or administrative concession by authorities. Motives vary from demanding the release of certain [[Incarceration|inmate]]s (notably [[Indian Airlines Flight 814|IC-814]]) to highlighting the grievances of a particular community (notably [[Air France Flight 8969|AF 8969]]). Hijackers also have used aircraft as a weapon to target particular locations (notably during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]).

Hijackings for hostages commonly produce an armed standoff during a period of negotiation between hijackers and authorities, followed by some form of settlement. Settlements do not always meet the hijackers' original demands. If the hijackers' demands are deemed too great and the perpetrators show no inclination to surrender, authorities sometimes employ armed [[Counter-terrorism|special forces]] to attempt a rescue of the hostages (notably [[Operation Entebbe]]).

==History==
{{See|List of notable aircraft hijackings}}
The first recorded aircraft hijack took place on February 21, 1931, in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]. [[Byron Rickards]], flying a [[Ford Tri-Motor]], was approached on the ground by armed revolutionaries. He refused to fly them anywhere and after a 10-day standoff Rickards was informed that the revolution was successful and he could go in return for giving one group member a lift to [[Lima]].
&lt;ref&gt;30 years later Rickards was again the victim of a failed hijacking attempt. A father and son boarded his [[Continental Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and tried to force him at gunpoint to fly the plane to [[Cuba]] hoping for a cash reward from [[Fidel Castro]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents and police chased the plane down the runway and shot out its tires, averting the hijacking. See [http://www.airdisaster.com/features/hijack/hijack.shtml http://www.airdisaster.com/features/hijack/hijack.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: In the Fort Worth Star-Telegram daily newspaper (morning edition) 19 September 1970, J. Howard &quot;Doc&quot; DeCelles states that he was actually the victim of the first skyjacking in December 1929. He was flying a postal route for the Mexican company Transportes Aeras Transcontinentales, ferrying mail from San Luis Potosí to Toreon and then on to Guadalajara. &quot;Doc&quot; was approached by Gen. Saturnino Cedillo, governor of the state of San Luis Potosí and one of the last remaining lieutenants of Pancho Villa. Cedillo was accompanied by several other men. He was told through an interpreter he had no choice in the matter. &quot;Doc&quot; stalled long enough to convey the information to his boss, who told him to cooperate. He had no maps, but was guided by the men as he flew above Mexican mountains. He landed on a road as directed, and was held captive for several hours under armed guard. He eventually was released with a &quot;Buenos&quot; from Cedillo and his staff. DeCelles kept his flight log, according to the article, but he did not file a report with authorities. &quot;Doc&quot; went on to work for the FAA in Fort Worth after his flying career.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph}}

Between 1948 and 1957 there were 15 hijackings worldwide, an average of a little more than one per year. Between 1958 and 1967, this climbed to 48, or about five per year. The number grew to 38 in 1968 and 82 in 1969, the largest number in a single year in the history of civil aviation; in January 1969 alone, eight airliners were hijacked to [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mccartney20100722&quot;&gt;McCartney, Scott. &quot;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704684604575380992283473182.html?mod=googlenews_wsj The Golden Age of Flight]&quot; ''The Wall Street Journal'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1968 and 1977, the annual average jumped to 41.

In 1973, the [[Nixon Administration]] ordered the discontinuance by the CIA of the use of hijacking as a covert action weapon against the Castro regime. Cuban intelligence followed suit. That year, the two countries reached an agreement for the prosecution or return of the hijackers and the aircraft to each other's country. The Taiwanese intelligence also followed the CIA's example-vis-а-vis China.

These measures plus the improvement in Israel's relations with Egypt and Jordan, the renunciation of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation Organization, the on-going peace talks between the PLO and Israel, the collapse of the communist states in East Europe, which reduced the scope for sanctuaries for terrorists, and the more cautious attitude of countries such as Libya and Syria after the U.S. declared them State-sponsors of international terrorism, the collapse of ideological terrorist groups such as the Red Army Faction and the tightening of civil aviation security measures by all countries have arrested and reversed the steep upward movement of hijackings.

However, the situation has not returned to the pre-1968 level and the number of successful hijackings continues to be high - an average of 18 per annum during the 10-year period between 1988 and 1997, as against the pre-1968 average of five.&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Raman&quot; /&gt;

On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], 19 al-Qaedan-affiliated Islamic extremists hijacked [[American Airlines Flight 11]], [[United Airlines Flight 175]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]], and [[United Airlines Flight 93]] and crashed them into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]], the southwestern side of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon building]], and [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] in a terrorist attack.

==Dealing with hijackings==
Before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], [[Aviator|pilot]]s and [[flight attendant]]s were trained to adopt the &quot;Common Strategy&quot; tactic, which was approved by the [[FAA]]. It taught crew members to comply with the hijackers' demands, get the plane to land safely and then let the security forces handle the situation. Crew members advised passengers to sit quietly in order to increase their chances of survival. They were also trained not to make any 'heroic' moves that could endanger themselves or other people. The FAA realized that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it would end peacefully with the hijackers reaching their goal.This led to an escalation of attacks. First a few planes were hijacked and blown up on the ground, then hijackers began killing a few passengers to make a &quot;political statement&quot; this escalation continued until reaching the logical conclusion on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

September 11 presented an unprecedented threat because it involved suicide hijackers who could fly an aircraft. The &quot;Common Strategy&quot; approach was not designed to handle suicide hijackings, and the hijackers were able to exploit a weakness in the civil aviation security system. Since then the &quot;Common Strategy&quot; policy has no longer been used.

Since the September 11th attacks, the situation for crew members, passengers and hijackers has changed. As in the case of [[United Airlines Flight 93]], where an airliner crashed into a field during a fight between flight attendants, passengers and hijackers while likely heading to the [[White House]] or the [[United States Capitol]], crew members and passengers now have to calculate the risks of passive cooperation, not only for themselves but also for those on the ground. Future hijackers most likely will encounter greater resistance from passengers and flight crews, making a successful hijacking more unlikely. An example of active passenger and crew member resistance occurred when passengers and flight attendants of [[2001 Shoe bomb plot|American Airlines Flight 63]] from [[Paris]] to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] on December 22, 2001, helped prevent [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]] from igniting explosives hidden in his shoe. Flight attendants and pilots now receive extensive anti-hijacking and self-defense training designed to thwart a hijacking.

===Informing air traffic control===
To communicate to air traffic control that an aircraft is being hijacked, a pilot under duress should [[squawk code|squawk]] 7500 or vocally, by radio communication, transmit &quot;(Aircraft callsign); Transponder seven five zero zero.&quot; This should be done when possible and safe. An air traffic controller who suspects an aircraft may have been hijacked may ask the pilot to confirm &quot;squawking assigned code.&quot; If the aircraft is ''not'' being hijacked, the pilot should ''not'' squawk 7500 and should inform the controller accordingly. A pilot under [[duress]] may also elect to respond that the aircraft is not being hijacked, but then neglect to change to a different squawk code. In this case the controller would make no further requests and immediately inform the appropriate authorities. A complete lack of a response would also be taken to indicate a possible hijacking. Of course, a loss of radio communications may also be the cause for a lack of response, in which case a pilot would usually squawk 7'''6'''00 anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Aeronautical Information Manual, paragraph 6-3-4, &quot;Special Emergency (Air Piracy)&quot;, [[Federal Aviation Administration]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9/11, the hijacker-pilot of Flight 11, [[Mohamed Atta]], mistakenly transmitted announcements to [[Air Traffic Control|ATC]], meaning to go through the Boeing 767. Also, [[Madeline Amy Sweeney|Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]] called the [[American Airlines]] office, telling the workers that Flight 11 was hijacked.

===Prevention===
Cockpit doors on most commercial airlines have been strengthened and are now bullet resistant. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[France]], [[Air Marshal (civil aviation)|air marshal]]s have also been added to some flights to deter and thwart hijackers. [[Airport security]] plays a major role in preventing hijackers. Screening passengers with [[metal detector]]s and luggage with [[x-ray]] machines prevents weapons from being taken on to an aircraft. Only in [[Israel]] is decompression used on all luggage to check for pressure sensor detonators{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Along with the FAA, the [[FBI]] also monitors terror suspects. Any person who is a threat to civil aviation is banned from flying{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

== Shooting down aircraft ==
Several states have stated that they would shoot down hijacked commercial aircraft if it can be assumed that the hijackers intend to use the aircraft in a 9/11-style attack, despite killing innocent passengers on board. According to reports, U.S. fighter pilots have been trained to shoot down hijacked commercial airliners should it become necessary.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3161354.stm] Other countries such as [[India]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]] have enacted laws or decrees that allow the shooting down of hijacked planes.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4172487.stm | work=BBC News | title=Poland to down hijacked aircraft | date=2005-01-13 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polish Constitutional Court however, in September 2008, decided that the regulations were unconstitutional and dismissed them.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trybunal.gov.pl/eng/summaries/documents/K_44_07_GB.pdf English translation of the judgement of the court]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In August 2005, India revealed its new anti-hijacking policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4150640.stm &quot;India adopts tough hijack policy&quot;]. [[BBC News]], August 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy came into force after the cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved it. The main points of the policy are
* Any attempt to hijack will be considered an act of aggression against the country and will prompt a response fit for an aggressor.
* Hijackers, if captured, will be sentenced to death.
* Hijackers will be engaged in negotiations only to bring the incident to an end, to comfort passengers and to prevent loss of lives.
* The plane will be shot down if it is deemed to become a missile heading for strategic targets.
* The plane will be escorted by armed fighter aircraft(s) and will be forced to land.
* A grounded plane will not be allowed to take off under any circumstance.

The list of strategic targets is prepared by the Bureau of Civil Aviation in India. The decision to shoot down a plane is taken by CCS. However, due to the shortage of time, whoever – the prime minister, the defense minister or the home minister – can be reached first will take the call. In situations in which an aircraft becomes a threat while taking off – which gives very little reaction time – a decision on shooting it down may be taken by an Indian Air Force officer not below the rank of Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Operations).

===Germany===
In January 2005 a federal law came into force in [[Germany]] – the ''[[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]]'' – that allowed &quot;direct action by armed force&quot; against a hijacked aircraft to prevent a 9/11-type attack. However, in February 2006 the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] struck down these provisions of the law, stating such preventive measures were unconstitutional and would essentially be state-sponsored murder, even if such an act would save many more lives on the ground. The main reasoning behind this decision was that the state would effectively be taking the lives of innocent hostages in order to avoid a terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20060215_1bvr035705en.html English translation of the judgement by the court]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also ruled that the [[Minister of Defense]] is constitutionally not entitled to act in terrorism matters, as this is the duty of the state and federal police forces. ''See the [[:de:Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zum Luftsicherheitsgesetz 2005|German Wikipedia entry]], or [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4715878.stm]''

The [[President of Germany]], [[Horst Köhler]], himself urged judicial review of the constitutionality of the Luftsicherheitsgesetz after he signed it into law in 2005.

== International law issues ==
===Tokyo Convention===

The [[Tokyo Convention|Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft]] (&quot;Tokyo Convention&quot;) is a multilateral convention, done at Tokyo between 20 August and 14 September 1963, coming into force on 4 December 1963, and is applicable to offences against penal law and to any acts jeopardising the safety of persons or property on board civilian aircraft while in-flight and engaged in international air navigation.

The convention, for the first time in the history of international aviation law, recognises certain powers and immunities of the [[Aviator|aircraft commander]] who on international flights may restrain any person(s) he has reasonable cause to believe is committing or is about to commit an offence liable to interfere with the safety of persons or property on board or who is jeopardising good order and discipline.

===Hague Convention===
Signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/hague1970.html Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft] contains 14 articles relating to what constitutes hijacking as well as guidelines for what is expected of governments when dealing with hijackings. The convention does not apply to customs, law enforcement or military aircraft, thus its scope appears to exclusively encompass civilian aircraft. Importantly, the convention only comes into force if the aircraft takes off or lands in a place different than its country of registration. For aircraft with joint registration, one country is designated as the registration state for the purpose of the convention.

[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Acropolis and [[Areios Pagos]] in Athens, [[Leo von Klenze]], 1846]]

The '''Acropolis of [[Athens]]''' or ''' Citadel of Athens''' is the best known [[acropolis]] (Gr. ''akros, akron,''&lt;ref&gt;acro-. (n.d.). In Greek, Acropolis means &quot;Highest City&quot;.  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved September 29, 2008, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acro- from Dictionary.com website:] Quote: &quot;[From Greek akros, extreme; see  ak- in Indo-European roots.] &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; edge, extremity + ''polis,'' city, pl. acropoleis)  in the world. Although there are many other acropoleis in [[Greece]], the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as '''The Acropolis''' without qualification. The Acropolis was formally proclaimed as the preeminent monument on the European Cultural Heritage list of monuments on 26 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/27/content_5900152.htm |title=Acropolis proclaimed top European Cultural Heritage Monument |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Acropolis is a flat-topped rock that rises {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the city of [[Athens]], with a surface area of about 3 [[hectare]]s.  It was also known as '''Cecropia''', after the legendary [[snake|serpent]]-man, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the first Athenian king.

==History==
===Early settlement===
While the earliest artifacts date to the Middle [[Neolithic]] era, there have been documented habitations in [[Attica]] from the Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC). There is little doubt that a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[megaron]] stood upon the hill during the late [[Aegean civilization|Bronze Age]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Nothing of this [[megaron]] survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps. Soon after the palace was constructed, a [[Cyclopean]] massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The wall consisted of two [[parapet]]s built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called ''emplekton'' (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmplektos ἔμπλεκτος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that  it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  [[Homer]] is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the &quot;strong-built House of [[Erechtheus]]&quot; ([[Odyssey]] 7.81). At some point before the 13th century an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the acropolis. This fissure extended some thirty five meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well was used as a protected source of drinking water during some portion of the Mycenaean period, as it was invaluable in times of siege.

===The Dark Ages===
There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was    such a palace, it seems to have been transplanted by later building activity on the Acropolis. Not much is known as to the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the archaic era. In the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was taken over by [[Cylon (ancient Athenian)|Kylon]] during the failed Kylonian revolt, and twice by [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]]: all attempts directed at seizing political power by ''[[coup]]s d' etat''. Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the ''Enneapylon'', had been built around the biggest water spring, the &quot;[[Clepsydra]]&quot;, at the northwestern foot.

===Archaic Acropolis===
A temple sacred to &quot;Athena Polias&quot; (Protectress of the City) was quickly erected by mid-6th century BC. This [[Doric order|Doric]] limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple, named after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue. Whether this temple replaced an older one, or a mere sacred precinct or altar, is not known. In the late 6th century BC yet another temple was built, usually referred to as the ''Archaios Naos'' (Old Temple). This temple of Athena Polias was built upon the ''Doerpfeld'' foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown where the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple was built. There are two popular theories (1) the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple was built upon the Doerpfeld foundations, (2) the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple was built where the Parthenon now stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; That being said it is unknown if the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple and the Archaios Naos coexisted.

To confuse matters, by the time the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; Temple had been dismantled, a newer and grander marble building, the &quot;[[Older Parthenon]]&quot; (often called the &quot;''Ur-Parthenon''&quot;, [[German language|German]] for &quot;Early Parthenon&quot;), was started following the victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490 BC. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared of older remnants, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of [[Piraeus]] limestone, a foundation {{convert|11|m|0|abbr=on}} deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall.

The Older Parthenon was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC. The building was burned and looted, along with the ''Archaios Naos'' and practically everything else on the rock. After the Persian crisis had subsided, the Athenians incorporated many of the unfinished temple's architectural members (unfluted column drums, triglyphs, metopes, etc.) into the newly built northern [[curtain wall]] of the Acropolis, where they serve as a prominent &quot;war memorial&quot; and can still be seen today. The devastated site was cleared of debris. Statuary, cult objects, religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill, serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic Parthenon. This [[Perserschutt|&quot;Persian debris&quot;]] is the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the Acropolis.

[[Image:Propylaea-athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Propylaea]]]]
[[Image:Erechtheum1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Erechtheum]]]]

===The Periclean building program===
Most of the major temples were rebuilt under the leadership of [[Pericles]] during the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age of Athens]] (460–430 BC). [[Phidias]], a great Athenian sculptor, and [[Ictinus]] and [[Callicrates]], two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction. During the 5th century BC, the Acropolis gained its final shape. After winning at [[Battle of the Eurymedon|Eurymedon]] in 468 BC, [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] ordered the reconstruction of southern and northern walls, and Pericles entrusted the building of the [[Parthenon]] to Ictinus and Callicrates.

In 437 BC, [[Mnesicles]] started building the [[Propylaea]], monumental gates with columns of [[Pentelic]] [[marble]], partly built upon the old propylaea of Pisistratus. These colonnades were almost finished in 432 BC and had two wings, the northern one serving as picture gallery. At the same time, south of the propylaea, building of the small Ionic [[Temple of Athena Nike]] commenced. After an interruption caused by the [[Peloponnesian War]], the temple was finished in the time of [[Nicias]]' peace, between 421 BC and 415 BC.

During the same period as the building of the [[Erechtheum]], a combination of sacred precincts including the temples of ''Athena Polias'', [[Poseidon]], [[Erechtheus]], [[Cecrops]], [[Herse]], [[Pandrosos]] and [[Aglauros]], with its so-called the ''Kore Porch'' (or ''[[Caryatid]]s' balcony''), was begun.

Between the temple of Athena Nike and the Parthenon, there was the [[temenos]] of [[Artemis]] Brauronia or [[Brauroneion]], the goddess represented as a bear and worshipped in the [[deme]] of Brauron. The archaic ''[[xoanon]]'' of the [[goddess]] and a statue made by [[Praxiteles]] in the 4th century BC were both in the sanctuary.

Behind the Propylaea, Phidias' gigantic bronze statue of [[Athena Promachos]] (&quot;she who fights in the front line&quot;), built between 450 BC and 448 BC, dominated. The base was {{convert|1.50|m|0|abbr=on}} high, while the total height of the statue was {{convert|9|m|0|abbr=on}}. The goddess held a lance whose gilt tip could be seen as a reflection by crews on ships rounding Cape [[Sounion]], and a giant shield on the left side, decorated by [[Mys]] with images of the fight between the [[Centaur]]s and the [[Lapiths]]. Other monuments that have left almost nothing visible to the present day are the [[Chalkotheke]], the [[Pandroseion]], [[Pandion's sanctuary]], Athena's altar, Zeus Polieus's sanctuary and, from Roman times, the circular temple of [[Augustus]] and [[Roma (mythology)|Rome]].

===Hellenistic and Roman period===

During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, many of the existing buildings in the area of the Acropolis were repaired, due to damage from age, and occasionally, war.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated54&quot;&gt;Travlos, John, ''Pictorial Dictionary of Ancient Athens'', London: Thames and Hudson, 1971. p.54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Monuments to foreign kings were erected, notably those of the [[Attalid|Attalid kings]] of Pergamon Attalos II (in front of the NW corner of the Parthenon), and Eumenes II, in front of the Propylaia.  These were rededicated during the early Roman Empire to Augustus (or perhaps Cladius), and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000 p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;  Eumenes was also responsible for constructing a [[Stoa of Eumenes|stoa]] on the South slope, not unlike that of [[Stoa of Attalos|Attalos]] in the [[Athenian agora|Agora]] below.

During the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian period]], the Temple of Rome and Augustus, a small, round edifice, about 23 meters from the Parthenon, was to be the last significant ancient construction on the summit of the rock.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the same time, on the North slope, in a cave next to the one dedicated to [[Pan (god)|Pan]] since the classical period, a sanctuary was founded where the [[Archons#Ancient Greece|archons]] dedicated to [[Apollo]] on taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Nulton, Peter, ''The Sanctuary of Apollo Hypoakraios and Imperial Athens'', Archaeologia Transatlantica XXI, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following century, on the South slope, Herodes Atticus built his grand [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus|odeon]].

[[Image:Venetian siege of Acropolis.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Venice|Venetian]] siege of 1687]]

During the 3rd century, under threat from a [[Herulian]] invasion, repairs were made to the Acropolis walls, and the &quot;Beule Gate&quot; was constructed to restrict entrance in front of the Propylaia, thus returning the Acropolis to use as a fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated54&quot;/&gt;

===Byzantine, Latin and Ottoman period===
In the [[Byzantine]] period, the Parthenon was turned into a church, dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. Under the Latin [[Duchy of Athens]], the Acropolis functioned as the city's administrative center, with the Parthenon as its cathedral, and the [[Propylaia]] as part of the Ducal [[Palace]]. A large tower was added, the &quot;Frankopyrgos&quot; (Tower of the Franks), demolished in the 19th century.  After the Ottoman conquest, the Parthenon was used as the garrison headquarters of the Turkish army,&lt;ref&gt;Hellenistic ministry of culture [http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 History of the Acropolis of Athens]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Erechtheum]] was turned into the [[Governor]]'s private [[Harem]]. The buildings of the Acropolis suffered significant damage during the 1687 siege by the Venetians in the [[Morean War]].  The Parthenon, which was being used as a gunpowder [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]], was hit by [[artillery]] fire and severely damaged.  In subsequent years, the Acropolis was a site of bustling human activity with many Byzantine, Frankish, and Ottoman structures.  The dominating feature during the Ottoman period was a mosque inside the Parthenon, complete with a minaret.  Following the [[Greek War of Independence]], most post-Byzantine features were cleared from the site as part of a Hellenizing project that swept the new nation-state.

[[Image:AthensAcropolisDawnAdj06028.jpg|thumb|300px|Acropolis of Athens at dawn, view from St. George Lycabettus Hotel]]

==Archaeological remains==
The entrance to the Acropolis was a monumental gateway called the [[Propylaea]]. To the south of the entrance is the tiny [[Temple of Athena Nike]]. A bronze statue of Athena, sculpted by [[Phidias]], originally stood at its centre. At the centre of the Acropolis is the [[Parthenon]] or Temple of Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin). East of the entrance and north of the Parthenon is the temple known as the [[Erechtheum]]. South of the platform that forms the top of the Acropolis there are also the remains of an outdoor theatre called [[Theatre of Dionysus]]. A few hundred metres away, there is the now partially reconstructed [[Theatre of Herodes Atticus]].

All the valuable ancient artifacts are situated in the [[Acropolis Museum]], which resides on the southern slope of the same rock, 280 metres from the Parthenon.

==The Acropolis Restoration Project==
The Project began in 1975 and is now nearing completion.  The aim of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction by acts of war, and misguided past restorations.  The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material - with new marble from [[Mount Penteli]] used sparingly.  All restoration was made using [[titanium]] dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things.  A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.

The Parthenon colonnades, largely destroyed by Venetian bombardment in the 17th century, were restored, with many wrongly assembled columns now properly placed.  The roof and floor of the Propylaea were partly restored, with sections of the roof made of new marble and decorated with blue and gold inserts, as in the original.  The temple of Athena Nike is the only edifice still unfinished, pending proper reassembly of its parts, all of which survive practically intact.

A total of 2,675 tons of architectural members were restored, with 686 stones reassembled from fragments of the originals, 905 patched with new marble, and 186 parts made entirely of new marble.  A total of 530 cubic meters of new Pentelic marble were used.

==Cultural significance==
Every four years, the Athenians held a festival called the [[Panathenaea]] that rivalled the [[Olympic Games]] in popularity. During the festival, a procession moved through Athens up to the Acropolis and into the [[Parthenon]] (Suggested to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze). There, a vast robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was ceremoniously placed on Phidias' massive ivory and gold statue of [[Athena]].

Columbia University, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]]) was a [[Germans|German]] philosopher and founder of the [[Illuminati|Order of Illuminati]], a secret society with origins in [[Bavaria]].

==Early life==
Adam Weishaupt was born on 6 February 1748 in [[Ingolstadt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB Vol. 41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA22,M1 22].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Prince-elector|Electorate]] of [[Bavarian]]. Weishaupt's father Johann Georg Weishaupt (1717–1753) died&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; when Adam was five years old. After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his [[Godparent|godfather]] [[Johann Adam von Ickstatt|Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt]]&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008371/images/index.html?seite=742 Vol. 13, pp. 740–741].&lt;/ref&gt; who, like his father, was a professor of law at the [[University of Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;Freninger, Franz Xaver, ed. ''Das Matrikelbuch der Universitaet Ingolstadt-Landshut-München''. München: A. Eichleiter, 1872. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ickstatt was a proponent of the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Peter Claus. ''Bayerns Weg in die Gegenwart''. Regensburg: Pustet, 1989. 262. Also, Bauerreiss, Romuald. ''Kirchengeschichte Bayerns''. Vol. 7. St. Ottilien: EOS Verlag, 1970. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; and he influenced the young Weishaupt with his [[rationalism]]. Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven&lt;ref name=&quot;ref name=&quot;ADB Vol. 41&quot;/&gt; at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school. He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768&lt;ref&gt;Freninger 47.&lt;/ref&gt; at age 20 with a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA25,M1 25–28].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772&lt;ref&gt;Freninger 32.&lt;/ref&gt; he became a professor of law. The following year he married Afra Sausenhofer&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA31,M1 31].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Eichstätt]].

After [[Pope Clement XIV]]’s [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1773, Weishaupt became a professor of [[canon law]],&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA33,M1 33]. Also, ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008399/images/index.html?seite=542 Vol. 41, p. 540].&lt;/ref&gt; a position that was held exclusively by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] until that time. In 1775 Weishaupt was introduced&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA61,M1 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Empiricism|empirical]] philosophy of [[Johann Georg Heinrich Feder]]&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008364/images/index.html?seite=597 Vol. 6, pp. 595–597].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]]. Both Feder and Weishaupt would later become opponents of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, Frederick C. ''The Fate of Reason''. Harvard University Press, 1987. [http://books.google.com/books?id=5ihJn9EKCl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA186,M1 186–88].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder of the Illuminati==
{{quote|At a time, however, when there was no end of making game of and abusing secret societies, I planned to make use of this human foible for a real and worthy goal, for the benefit of people. I wished to do what the heads of the ecclesiastical and secular authorities ought to have done by virtue of their offices ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schneider |first1=Heinrich |authorlink1= |title=Quest for Mysteries: The Masonic Background for Literature in 18th Century |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2005 |month= |origyear=1947 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |language= |isbn=1-4191-8214-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=24 n.49 |pages= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 1 May 1776 Weishaupt formed the &quot;Order of Perfectibilists&quot;. He adopted the name of &quot;Brother [[Spartacus]]&quot; within the order. Though the Order was not [[egalitarian]] or democratic, its mission was the abolition of all monarchical governments and state religions in Europe and its colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07661b.htm Illuminati], sourcing Illuminati papers&lt;/ref&gt;

Weishaupt wrote: &quot;the ends justified the means.&quot;{{citation needed|date=December 2008}} The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know, a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

Weishaupt was initiated into the [[Masonic Lodge]] &quot;Theodor zum guten Rath&quot;, at Munich in 1777. His project of &quot;illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice&quot; was an unwelcome reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt; Soon however he had developed [[gnostic]] mysteries of his own, with the goal of &quot;perfecting human&quot; nature through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. He began working towards incorporating his system of Illuminism with that of Freemasonry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

He wrote: &quot;I did not bring [[Deism]] into Bavaria more than into Rome. I found it here, in great vigour, more abounding than in any of the neighboring [[Protestant]] States. I am proud to be known to the world as the founder of the Illuminati.&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Weishaupt's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of [[Karl Theodor]], Elector of Bavaria, in 1784. Weishaupt lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

==Activities in exile==
He received the assistance of [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke Ernest II]] of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] (1745–1804), and lived in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] writing a series of works on illuminism, including ''A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria'' (1785), ''A Picture of Illuminism'' (1786), ''An Apology for the Illuminati'' (1786), and ''An Improved System of Illuminism'' (1787). Adam Weishaupt died in Gotha on 18 November 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB Vol. 41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Engel 1906&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;van Dülmen 1975&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stauffer 1918&quot;/&gt; He was survived by his second wife, Anna Maria (née Sausenhofer), and his children Nanette, Charlotte, Ernst, [[Karl von Weishaupt|Karl]], [[Eduard von Weishaupt|Eduard]], and Alfred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engel 1906&quot;/&gt; Weishaupt was buried next to his son Wilhelm who preceded him in death in 1802.

==Contemporary Opinion==
{{main|Illuminati}}
[[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], a professor of [[natural philosophy]] at [[Edinburgh University]] in [[Scotland]] and a member of a Freemason Lodge there, said he had been asked to join the Illuminati. After consideration he concluded that the Illuminati were not for him. In 1798 he published a book called ''Proofs of a Conspiracy'' in which he wrote: &quot;An association has been formed for the express purposes of rooting out all the religious establishments and overturning all existing governments ... the leaders would rule the World with uncontrollable power, while all the rest would be employed as tools of the ambition of their unknown superiors.&quot; This book was sent to [[George Washington]], who replied:

:''It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WasFi36.xml&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=388&amp;division=div1 George Washington – Letter to the Reverend G.

==Quotes about Weishaupt==
{{quote|Wishaupt [sic] seems to be an enthusiastic Philanthropist. He is among those (as you know the excellent [[Richard Price|[Richard] Price]] and [[Joseph Priestly|[Joseph] Priestley]] also are) who believe in the indefinite perfectibility of man. He thinks he may in time be rendered so perfect that he will be able to govern himself in every circumstance so as to injure none, to do all the good he can, to leave government no occasion to exercise their powers over him, &amp; of course to render political government useless.|[[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID+@lit(tj090050))|title=''Thomas Jefferson to Reverend James Madison, January 31, 1800,'' The Thomas Jefferson Papers (American Memory from the Library of Congress)|accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Wishaupt [sic] believes that to promote this perfection of the human character was the object of Jesus Christ. That his intention was simply to reinstate natural religion, &amp; by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves. His precepts are the love of god &amp; love of our neighbor. And by teaching innocence of conduct, he expected to place men in their natural state of liberty &amp; equality. He says, no one ever laid a surer foundation for liberty than our grand master, Jesus of Nazareth. He believes the Free masons were originally possessed of the true principles &amp; objects of Christianity, &amp; have still preserved some of them by tradition, but much disfigured. The means he proposes to effect this improvement of human nature are &quot;to enlighten men, to correct their morals &amp; inspire them with benevolence. Secure of our success, sais he, we abstain from violent commotions. To have foreseen, the happiness of posterity &amp; to have prepared it by irreproachable means, suffices for our felicity. The tranquility of our consciences is not troubled by the reproach of aiming at the ruin or overthrow of states or thrones.&quot; As Wishaupt [sic] lived under the tyranny of a despot &amp; priests, he knew that caution was necessary even in spreading information, &amp; the principles of pure morality. He proposed therefore to lead the Free masons to adopt this object &amp; to make the objects of their institution the diffusion of science &amp; virtue. He proposed to initiate new members into his body by gradations proportioned to his fears of the thunderbolts of tyranny. This has given an air of mystery to his views, was the foundation of his banishment, the subversion of the masonic order, &amp; is the colour for the ravings against him of Robinson, Barruel &amp; Morse, whose real fears are that the craft would be endangered by the spreading of information, reason, &amp; natural morality among men. This subject being new to me, I have imagined that if it be so to you also, you may receive the same satisfaction in seeing, which I have had in forming the analysis of it: &amp; I believe you will think with me that if Wishaupt [sic] had written here, where no secrecy is necessary in our endeavors to render men wise &amp; virtuous, he would not have thought of any secret machinery for that purpose. |[[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;}}

==References in pop culture==
Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', written by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], as the founder of the [[Bavarian Illuminati]] and as an imposter who killed [[George Washington]] and took his place as the first president of the [[United States]]. Washington's portrait on the [[U.S. one-dollar bill]] is said to actually be Weishaupt's.

Another version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]'' by [[Dave Sim]], as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the ''Cerebus'' and ''[[Church &amp; State I]]'' volumes. His motives are [[republic]]an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.

Weishaupt is also mentioned among the mish-mash of complicated conspiracies in the PC game ''[[Deus Ex]]''. During JC Denton's escape from Versalife labs in Hong Kong, he recovers a virus engineered with the molecular structure in multiples of [[23 Enigma|17 and 23]]. Tracer Tong notes &quot;1723... the birthdate of Adam Weishaupt&quot; Weishaupt was in fact born in 1748. However 1723 was the year that Weishaupt's freemasonry lodge, &quot;Theodor zum guten Rath&quot;, was founded.

Adam Weishaupt is also mentioned (&quot;[[George W. Bush|Bush]] got a [[ouija]] to talk to Adam Weishaupt&quot;) by the New York rapper [[Cage Kennylz|Cage]] in [[El-P]]'s &quot;Accidents Don't Happen&quot;, the ninth track on his album ''[[Fantastic Damage]]'' (2002).

The '''Acorn Electron''' is a budget version of the [[BBC Micro]] educational/[[home computer]] made by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]]. It has 32 [[kilobyte]]s of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], and its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] includes [[BBC BASIC]] along with its [[operating system]].

The Electron was able to save and load programs onto [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard [[tape recorder]] that had the correct sockets. It was capable of basic graphics, and could display onto either a television set, a colour ([[RGB]]) monitor or a &quot;[[Green-screen display|green screen]]&quot; monitor.

At its peak, the Electron was the third best selling micro in the [[United Kingdom]], and total lifetime game sales for the Electron exceeded those of the BBC Micro. There are at least 500 known games for the Electron and the true total is probably in the thousands{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

The hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized [[Gate array|ULA]] chip designed by Acorn. It had feature limitations such as being unable to output more than one channel of sound where the BBC was capable of three-way polyphony (plus one noise channel) and the inability to provide [[teletext]] mode. 

The ULA controlled memory access and was able to provide 32K × 8 bits of addressable RAM using 4 × 64K × 1-bit [[random-access memory|RAM]] chips (4164). Due to needing two accesses to each chip instead of one, and the complications of the video hardware also needing access, reading or writing RAM was much slower than on the BBC Micro. This meant that although ROM applications ran at the same speed, there was a substantial speed decrease on applications running from RAM.

==History==
The Electron was developed during 1983 as a cheap sibling for the [[BBC Micro]] with the intention of capturing the low cost Christmas sales market for that year. Although Acorn were able to shrink substantially the same functionality as the [[BBC Micro|BBC]] into just one chip, manufacturing problems meant that very few machines were available for the Christmas period - to the extent that some shops reported eight presales for every delivered machine.

This was a blow from which the machine never fully recovered, although games sales for it would ultimately outstrip those of the BBC Micro. Following [[Olivetti]]'s 1985 cash injection into Acorn the machine was effectively sidelined.

With hindsight, the machine lacked the RAM (a typical program would need to fit in only around 20&amp;nbsp;kB once display memory is subtracted) and processing power to take on the prevailing [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with [[BBC Master]] and [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] were first features of Electron expansion units, including ROM cartridge slots and the [[Advanced Disc Filing System]] — a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original [[Disc Filing System]].

Whilst it may not have been as popular as the Spectrum, Commodore 64 or [[Amstrad CPC]], it did sell in sufficient numbers to ensure that new software was being produced right up until the early 1990s. This meant the Electron had a lifespan not much shorter than those more popular micros and much longer than competitors such as the [[Oric-1]] and [[Dragon 32]].

==Popular upgrades==
===Acorn Plus 1===
[[Image:Acorn Electron and Plus 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An Acorn Electron with Plus 1 expansion unit attached]]
The Acorn Plus 1 added two ROM slots, an analogue interface and a parallel port. The analogue interface was normally used for joysticks, the parallel for a printer.

Access to ROM memory occurred at 2&amp;nbsp;MHz regardless of graphics mode so theoretically programs released on ROM could run at least twice as fast as those released on tape or disc. Despite this all of the games released on ROM were packaged as 'serial ROMS', from which the micro would load programs into main memory in exactly the same way as if it were loading from tape. This meant that programs did not need to be modified for their new memory location but gave no execution speed benefits whatsoever.

===Acorn Plus 3===
The Acorn Plus 3 was a hardware module that connected independently of the Plus 1 and provided a double-density 3½” disc drive connected through a [[WD1770]] drive controller and an [[Advanced Disk Filing System|ADFS]] ROM. Because the WD1770 is capable of single density mode and uses the same IBM360 derived floppy disc format as the Intel 8271 found in the BBC Micro, it was also possible to run a [[Disc Filing System|DFS]] filing system with an alternate ROM.

===First Byte Joystick Interface===
As a games machine the Electron shared the same failing as the Sinclair Spectrum in not having a joystick port. This was quickly remedied by First Byte Computers who developed an interface and software which allowed a &quot;switched&quot; joystick to be used with the majority of software titles. This interface became very popular and was sold by W.H. Smiths, Boots, Comet and hundreds of independent computer dealers.

===P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3===
[[Image:Advanced Plus 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3 with a 3½” drive]]
The Advanced Plus 3 was very similar to the Acorn Plus 3 but packaged as a ROM cartridge for the Plus 1 with a disc drive connector at the head. This made it possible to connect a 5¼” floppy disc drive as used by BBC Micro owners or a more common 3½” drive.

===Slogger/Elektuur Turbo Board===
The Slogger and Elektuur Turbo Boards were born out of a hack initially devised at Acorn. By moving the lowest 8&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM outside of reach of the ULA, the CPU could always access it at 2&amp;nbsp;MHz. The tradeoff was that the screen could not be located in that 8&amp;nbsp;KB. In practice the operating system ROMs always put the screen into the top 24&amp;nbsp;KB and as a result this probably only broke compatibility with around 2% of software.

The Slogger Turbo Board was a professionally fitted upgrade whereas the Elektuur modification was described in an article in Dutch Electronics magazine Elektuur and intended for users to perform at home.

Speeding up the low portion of memory is particularly useful on 6502 derived machines because that processor has a faster addressing mode for the first 256 bytes and so it is common for software to put any variables involved in time critical sections of program into that region.

If Acorn had thought to include this small modification in the original Electron design it is likely the machine would have had a much greater impact as it would have nearly doubled the amount of motion possible in games and saved modes 0–3 (including the only 16 colour mode) from being nearly useless due to contended memory timings.

===Slogger Master RAM Board===
A development of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32&amp;nbsp;kB of shadow RAM in addition to the ordinary 32&amp;nbsp;kB —  giving 64&amp;nbsp;kB total. Some clever program counter catches meant that the ordinary system ROMs and any software using the OS calls could function without significant modification, making substantially more memory available for BASIC, View, Viewsheet and almost every other business application. By providing extra storage this modification also allowed some games and applications intended for the BBC Micro to function on the Electron despite the lack of a native Mode 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbyist page describing BBC Micro software compatibility using 64 bK expansion cards&quot;&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Andy's guide to using BBC software on a 64K modified Acorn Electron.
  | url = http://www.andysarcade.net/personal/elk/64kmod/64kelectron.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications could not directly address video memory in this mode without modification, so it was incompatible with most games, although there is no inherent reason why a game could not be written to function in shadow mode.

During its decline, Master RAM Boards were added to every Electron in an attempt to increase sales.

===Jafa Systems Mode 7 Display Unit===
Of the capabilities present in the BBC Micro but absent from the Electron, the teletext style ''mode 7'' was particularly conspicuous because of the very low memory usage in that mode (just less than 1&amp;nbsp;kB) and the high number of BBC programs that used it. Jafa Systems provided a number of solutions to redress this deficiency.

The most basic solution was a pure software system supplied on a ROM cartridge that drew a low resolution approximation of the mode 7 display in a graphics mode. Although cheap and effective in enabling use of some software that only used official ROM entry points for text output, this solution proved very slow because the Electron had to be placed into an 80 byte pitch display to be able to get anywhere near to reproducing mode 7 and the CPU spent a lot of time drawing approximations of mode 7 characters and graphics that in a hardware solution would be achieved without any CPU processing. It also used up 20&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM for the graphics display rather than the 1&amp;nbsp;kB of a hardware mode 7.

Two solutions with additional hardware were provided. The first used the same graphics processor as the BBC Micro in mode 7 —  the [[SAA5050]] — but used software to ensure that it was fed with the correct graphics data. A software ROM would put the machine into an ordinary 40 byte pitch display. While the ULA would read the display from memory in the usual fashion, the SAA5050 would listen to the data it was reading and produce a mode 7 interpretation of the same information. When necessary the hardware would switch between the graphics output being produced by the micro and that being produced by the add-on.

The disadvantage to this system is that while the SAA5050 would expect to be repeatedly fed the same 40 bytes of data for every display scanline of every character row, the ULA would read a different set of 40 bytes for every display scanline in order to produce a full graphics display. A software ROM worked around this by duplicating the data intended for a mode 7 display in memory. Although this produced a mode 7 that barely impacted upon CPU performance and gave the same visual quality as the BBC Micro, it remained compatible only with software that used the ROM routines for outputting text and graphics and still used 10&amp;nbsp;kB of memory for the display.

A second version of the hardware add-on corrected these problems. By adding a [[CRTC6845]] to the package, a full hardware solution was created that did not reduce CPU performance and only used 1&amp;nbsp;kB of memory for the display. A software ROM was still supplied, but this did no more than expand the hardware ROM so that it knew mode 7 now existed and was able to switch into it.

==Merlin M2105==
An unusual variant of the Electron was sold by [[British Telecom]] Business Systems as the BT Merlin M2105 Communications Terminal. This consisted of a de-badged Electron plus a large expansion unit containing 32&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM, 48&amp;nbsp;KB of ROM, a [[Centronics printer port]] and a [[modem]]. The ROM firmware provided [[dial-up]] communications facilities. These were used by the [[Interflora]] florists network in the UK for over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/revs/misc/r-mer2.html Merlin M2105 information]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quirks===
[[Image:ExileElectron.png|thumb|left|''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' is an example of a game where the developers left non-graphical data visible in the display buffer to gain additional memory space.]]
Like the [[BBC Micro]], the Electron was constrained by limited memory resources. Of the 32&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, 3½ KB was allocated to the OS at startup and at least 10&amp;nbsp;KB was taken up by the display buffer in contiguous display modes.

Due to the timing of interrupts it was possible to disable either the top 100 or bottom 156 lines of the display with palette changes. Many games took advantage of this, gaining storage by leaving non-graphical data in the disabled area.

Other games would load non-graphical data into the display, leaving it visible as regions of apparently randomly coloured pixels.

Although [[page flipping]] was a hardware possibility, the limited memory forced most applications to do all their drawing directly to the visible screen, often resulting in graphical [[Flicker (screen)|flicker]] or visible redraw. A notable exception is [[Players (publisher)|Players]]' ''[[Joe Blade]]'' series.

===Tricks===
====FireTrack: smooth vertical scrolling====
Although programs can alter the position of the screen in memory, the non-linear format of the display means that vertical scrolling can only be done in blocks of 8 pixels without further work.

''[[Firetrack|FireTrack]]'' exploits a division in the way the Electron handles its display — of the seven available graphics modes, two are configured so that the final two of every ten scanlines are blank and are not based on the contents of RAM. If 16 scanlines of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of 8 scanlines, separated in the middle by two blank scanlines.

In order to keep track of its position within the display, the Electron maintains an internal display address counter. The same counter is used in both the continuous and non-continuous graphics modes and switching modes mid-frame does not cause any adjustment to the counter.

''FireTrack'' switches from a non-continuous to a continuous graphics mode part way down the display. By using the palette to mask the top area of the display and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics at the bottom of the display down in two pixel increments because the internal display counter is not incremented on blank scanlines during non-continuous graphics modes.

====Exile: sampled speech====
{{Listen|filename=Welcome to the Land of the Exile (Electron).ogg|title=&quot;Welcome to the Land of the Exile&quot;|description=&quot;Welcome to the Land of the Exile&quot; sample|format=[[ogg]]}}
''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' turns the Electron's one channel output into a digital speaker for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] output.

The speaker can be programmatically switched on or off at any time but is permanently attached to a hardware counter so is normally only able to output a square wave. But if set to a frequency outside the human audible range then the ear can't perceive the square wave, only the difference between the speaker being switched on and off. This gives the effect of a simple toggle speaker similar to that seen in the 48&amp;nbsp;kB [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. ''Exile'' uses this to output 1-bit audio samples.

==Popular games==
Although not as well supported by the biggest software publishers as rivals like the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], a good range of games were available for the Electron. The traditional [[BBC Micro]] publishers such as [[Acornsoft]], [[Superior Software]] and [[Micro Power]] offered the widest support. Notable popular games particularly associated with the Electron include:[[Image:CrystalCastles Electron.gif|thumb|''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'' is an example of a popular arcade game officially ported to the Electron (US Gold).]]
* ''[[Starship Command]]'' ([[Acornsoft]], 1983)
* ''[[Chuckie Egg]]'' (A'n'F, 1984)
* ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' ([[Acornsoft]], 1984)
* the ''[[Repton (video game)|Repton]]'' series ([[Superior Software]], 1985–1989)
* ''[[Thrust (video game)|Thrust]]'' ([[Superior Software]], 1986)
* ''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' ([[Superior Software]], 1988)

There were also many popular games officially converted to the Electron from arcade machines (including ''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'', ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'', ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Paperboy (video game)|Paperboy]]'' and ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'') or other home computer systems (including ''[[Impossible Mission]]'', ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'', ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[The Last Ninja]]'', ''[[Barbarian (computer game)|Barbarian]]'' and ''[[SimCity]]'').

Despite Acorn themselves effectively shelving the Electron in 1985, games continued to be developed and released by professional software houses until 1991. There were around 1,400 games released for the Acorn Electron, several thousand extra public domain titles were released on disc through Public Domain libraries. Notable enterprises which produced discs of such software are [[BBC PD]], [[EUG (Electron User Group)|Electron User Group]] and [[HeadFirst PD]].

==Emulation==
Three emulators of the machine exist, [[ElectrEm]] ([http://electrem.emuunlim.com]) for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[Linux]]/[[Mac OS X]], Elkulator ([http://elkulator.acornelectron.co.uk]) for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[DOS]] and the Multi-system emulator [[MESS]].

'''''A Fire Upon the Deep''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Vernor Vinge]], a [[space opera]] involving superhuman intelligences, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], variable physics, space battles, love, betrayal, genocide, and a conversation medium resembling [[Usenet]]. ''A Fire Upon the Deep'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo Award]] in 1993 (tied with [[Doomsday Book (novel)|''Doomsday Book'']] by [[Connie Willis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-1993&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the normal print book editions, the novel was also included on a [[CD-ROM]] sold by [[ClariNet Communications]] along with the other nominees for the 1993 Hugo awards. The CD-ROM edition included numerous annotations by Vinge on his thoughts and intentions about different parts of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.slashdot.org/books/03/09/18/0411259.shtml Review of  the annotated  ebook edition of ''A Fire Upon the Deep''] at [[Slashdot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A human expedition investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches for the ambitious young civilization of the Straumli Realm. The expedition's facility, called High Lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant super-intelligent entity known as the Blight. The Blight rapidly learns how to infiltrate and control the computer systems of High Lab, and even develops the ability to possess and control the living humans. The novel starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of this [[superintelligence]] through exponentially accelerating developmental stages, ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], nigh-[[omnipotent]] power that is unfathomable to mere humans. Shortly before its final &quot;flowering&quot;, the changes in a single minute of the Blight's life are said to exceed those of 10,000 years of human civilization.

Realizing the danger of what they have unleashed, the researchers at High Lab attempt to flee in two of ships. Suspicious, the Blight discovers that one of the ships contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it, the Blight destroys the ship. The second ship is allowed to escape, unharmed, as the Blight assumes that it cannot harm it. However, the second ship actually holds the Blight countermeasure.

The ship lands on a nearby planet with a [[medieval]]-level civilization of dog-like creatures dubbed &quot;Tines&quot;. The ship is revealed to be a &quot;sleeper&quot; ship, carrying most of High Lab's children in &quot;[[suspended animation|coldsleep boxes]]&quot;. The boxes are rapidly failing and the surviving adults begin unloading them, but are killed when two rival Tines forces attempt to seize the ship.  The faction that initially contacts the humans, led by a Tine known as Steel, kills the adults and destroys many of the coldsleep boxes. They also capture a boy named Jefri Olsndot, whom they intend to exploit in order to develop advanced technology (such as the [[cannon]]). On the other hand, Jefri's older sister, Johanna, is rescued by the rival faction of Tines led by a Woodcarver. She, too, is exploited to develop technology that could gain the upper hand in the Tine war.

Meanwhile, the sleeper ship has been transmitting a distress signal. The signal eventually reaches &quot;Relay&quot;, a major node in the galactic communications network. A benign transcendent entity (known as a &quot;Power&quot;) named &quot;Old One&quot; contacts Relay, seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it.  Old One constructs a seemingly human man, Pham Nuwen, to act as its agent. Pham and Ravna Bergsndot, a human working at Relay for the wealthy Vrinimi Organization, trace the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world. Old One designs a vessel, the ''Out of [[Band (radio)|Band]] II'', to reach the Tines world and to investigate what the ship carried with it from the High Lab.

The Blight attacks Relay and Old One. Old One gives Pham the information necessary to activate the Blight Countermeasure, and Pham and Ravna escape Relay's destruction in the ''Out of Band II''. After arriving at the Tines homeworld and allying with Woodcarver to defeat Steel, Pham initiates the Countermeasure, which drastically alters the local physics in that sector of the galaxy. This shifts the surrounding area into the &quot;Slow Zone&quot; (where [[superluminal travel]] is impossible), thrusting thousands of nearby uninvolved civilizations into an environment where much of their technology no longer functions, potentially causing trillions of collateral deaths. However, the massive shift in physical law also envelops and destroys the Blight, ending its destructive reign. Unfortunately it also kills Pham and strands the other humans on the Tines world, now in the depths of the &quot;Slow Zone&quot; where rescue by an advanced civilization is impossible.

'''Aeronautics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὰήρ ''āēr'' which means &quot;air&quot; and ναυτική ''nautikē'' which means &quot;navigation, seamanship&quot;, i.e. &quot;navigation of the air&quot;) is the [[science]] involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of [[flight]]-capable machines, or the techniques of operating [[aircraft]]. While the term—literally meaning &quot;sailing the air&quot;—originally referred solely to the science of ''operating'' the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business and other aspects related to aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

One of the significant parts in aeronautics is a branch of [[physical science]] called [[aerodynamics]], which deals with the motion of [[air]] and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft. '''[[Aviation]]''' is a term sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although &quot;aeronautics&quot; includes lighter-than-air craft such as [[airship]]s, while &quot;aviation&quot; does not.&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;

==Early aeronautics==
[[File:Flying boat.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Francesco Lana de Terzi]]'s flying boat concept c.1670.]]
The first mention of aeronautics in history was in the writings of ancient Egyptians who described the flight of birds. It also finds mention in ancient China where people were flying kites thousands of years ago. The medieval Islamic scientists were not far behind, as they understood the actual mechanism of bird flight. Before scientific investigation of aeronautics started, people started thinking of ways to fly. In a Greek legend, [[Icarus]] and his father [[Daedalus]] built wings of feathers and wax and flew out of a prison. Icarus flew too close to the sun, the wax melted, and he fell in the sea and drowned. When people started to scientifically study how to fly, people began to understand the basics of air and aerodynamics. [[Ibn Firnas]] may have tried to fly in 8th century in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]].&lt;ref name=Aramco&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196401/first.flights.htm First Flights], ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January–February 1964, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Bacon]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were some of the first modern Europeans to study aeronautics. Leonardo studied the flight of birds in developing engineering schematics for some of the earliest flying machines in the late fifteenth century AD. His schematics, however, such as the ornithopter ultimately failed as practical aircraft. The flapping machines that he designed were either too small to generate sufficient lift, or too heavy for a human to operate.

Although the ornithopter continues to be of interest to hobbyists, it was replaced by the glider in the 19th century. [[Sir George Cayley]] was one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Sir George Carley| url = http://www.flyingmachines.org/cayl.html| publisher = Flyingmachines.org| accessdate = 2009-07-26| quote = Sir George Cayley is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics.

[[Francesco Lana de Terzi]], a 17th century [[Jesuit]] professor of physics and mathematics from [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], has been referred to as the Father of Aeronautics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Francesco Lana-Terzi, S.J.

==Early aviation research==

Many cultures have built devices that travel through the air, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/1/14.html Archytas of Tar entum, Technology Museum of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://automata.co.uk/History%20page.htm Automata history]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[boomerang]] in [[Australia]], the hot air [[Kongming lantern]], and [[kite]]s. There are early legends of human flight such as the story of [[Icarus]], and [[Jamshid]] in Persian myth, and later, somewhat more credible claims of short-distance human flights appear, such as the flying automaton of [[Archytas]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (428–347 BC),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Aviation: Reaching for the Sky]''&quot;.

ISBN 1881508331&lt;/ref&gt; the winged flights of [[Abbas Ibn Firnas]] (810–887), [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] (11th century), and the hot-air [[Passarola]] of [[Bartholomeu Lourenço de Gusmão|Bartolomeu Lourenço de Gusmão]] (1685–1724).

The modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, in a [[hot air balloon]] designed by the [[Montgolfier brothers]].  The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.

In 1799 [[Sir George Cayley]] set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Early aviation==
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|left|First assisted take-off flight by the [[Wright Brothers]], December 17, 1903]]

While there are [[First flying machine|many competing claims]] for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight, the most widely-accepted date is December 17, 1903 by the Wright brothers. The Wright brothers were the first to fly in a powered and controlled aircraft. Previous flights were gliders (control but no power) or free flight (power but no control), but the Wright brothers combined both, setting the new standard in aviation records. Following this, the widespread adoption of [[aileron]]s versus wing warping made aircraft much easier to control, and only a decade later, at the start of [[World War I]], heavier-than-air powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, and even attacks against ground positions.

Aircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable. In contrast to small non-rigid [[Non-rigid airship|blimps]], giant [[rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.
[[Image:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumb|''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' at [[Lakehurst Naval Air Station]], 1936]]

The most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[Hindenburg (airship)|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.

Great progress was made in the field of aviation during the 1920s and 1930s, such as [[Charles Lindbergh|Charles Lindbergh's]] solo transatlantic flight in 1927, and [[Charles Kingsford Smith]]'s transpacific flight the following year. One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] that was profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of [[World War II]], many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.

==Modern aviation==
[[Image:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]
After [[World War II]], especially in [[North America]], there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[The New Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.

By the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely-used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other planes at the time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.

Since the 1960s, [[composite material|composite]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful [[computer]]s and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.

On June 21, 2004, [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere.  Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common and may soon enter the mainstream, at least for light aircraft.


== Rocketry ==
{{See also|Rocket}}
[[File:Apollo 15 launch.ogg|thumb|right|Launch of ''[[Apollo 15]]'' [[Saturn V]] rocket: ''T'' - 30 s through ''T'' + 40 s.]]

A [[rocket]] or rocket vehicle is a [[missile]], spacecraft, [[aircraft]] or other [[vehicle]] which obtains [[thrust]] from a [[rocket engine]]. In all rockets, the exhaust is formed entirely from [[propellant]]s carried within the rocket before use.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPE7&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780471326427|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocket engines work by [[Reaction (physics)|action and reaction]]. Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASAEARLY&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|MSFC History Office}} &quot;Rockets in Ancient Times (100 B.C. to 17th Century)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology of the [[Space Age]], including [[Apollo 11|setting foot on the moon]].

Rockets are used for [[fireworks]], weaponry, [[ejection seat]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s for [[artificial satellite]]s, [[human spaceflight]] and [[Space exploration|exploration]] of other planets. While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, they are very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining [[escape velocity|extremely high speeds]] with reasonable efficiency.

[[Chemical rocket]]s are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of [[rocket propellant]]. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

(Appropriately, &quot;lumière&quot; translates as &quot;light&quot; in English.)

==History==
The Lumière brothers were born in [[Besançon]], [[France]], in 1862 and 1864, and moved to [[Lyon]] in 1870, where both attended [[La Martiniere Lyon|La Martiniere]], the largest technical school in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motion Pictures | author = Gina De Angelis | publisher = The Oliver Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781881508786 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=daHmkclqERYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Lumi%C3%A8re+Besan%C3%A7on+Lyon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=eqdfSaiYK4PAlQTF4tj7BQ#PPA34,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father, '''Claude-Antoine Lumière''' (1840–1911), ran a [[History of the camera|photographic]] firm and both brothers worked for him: Louis as a physicist and Auguste as a manager. Louis had made some improvements to the still-photograph process, the most notable being the dry-plate process, which was a major step towards moving images.

It was not until their father retired in 1892 that the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented a number of significant processes leading up to their film camera - most notably [[film perforations]] (originally implemented by [[Emile Reynaud]]) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The [[cinématographe]] itself was patented on 13 February 1895 and the first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on March 19, 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

The Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Chardère (1985), p.71. This first screening on March 22, 1895 took place in Paris, at the &quot;Society for the Development of the National Industry&quot;, in front of an audience of 200 people - among which [[Léon Gaumont]], then director of the Comptoir de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (color photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the colored stills photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their first public screening of films at which admission was charged was held on December 28, 1895, at [[Salon Indien du Grand Café]] in Paris. This history-making presentation featured ten short films, including their first film, ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon]]'' (''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html &quot;La première séance publique payante&quot;, Institut Lumière]&lt;/ref&gt; Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.

[[Image:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]'']] It is believed their first film was actually recorded that same year (1895)&lt;ref&gt;Chardère (1987), p.70: The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded March 19th 1895, and then publicly projected March 22nd at the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Léon Bouly]]'s [[cinematographe|cinématographe]] device, which was patented the previous year. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project [[film|motion picture]]s — was further developed by the Lumières.

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following ten short films (in order of presentation):[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html]

#''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|La Sortie de l'Usine Lumière à Lyon]]'' (literally, &quot;the exit from the Lumière factory in Lyon&quot;, or, under its more common English title, ''Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory''), 46 seconds
#''[[La Voltige]]'' (&quot;Horse Trick Riders&quot;), 46 seconds
#''[[La Pêche aux poissons rouges]]'' (&quot;fishing for goldfish&quot;), 42 seconds
#''[[The Photographical Congress Arrives in Lyon|Le Débarquement du Congrès de Photographie à Lyon]]'' (&quot;the disembarkment of the Congress of Photographers in Lyon&quot;), 48 seconds
#''[[Les Forgerons]]'' (&quot;Blacksmiths&quot;), 49 seconds
#''Le Jardinier ([[l'Arroseur Arrosé]])'' (&quot;The Gardener,&quot; or &quot;The Sprinkler Sprinkled&quot;), 49 seconds
#''[[Repas de bébé]]'' (&quot;Baby's Breakfast&quot; (lit. &quot;baby's meal&quot;)), 41 seconds
#''[[Le Saut à la couverture]]'' (&quot;Jumping Onto the Blanket&quot;), 41 seconds
#''[[Place des Cordeliers à Lyon|La Place des Cordeliers à Lyon]]'' (&quot;Cordeliers Square in Lyon&quot;--a street scene), 44 seconds
#''[[La Mer (film)|La Mer (Baignade en mer)]]'' (&quot;the sea [bathing in the sea]&quot;), 38 seconds

The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896 - visiting [[Bombay]], [[London]], [[New York]] and [[Buenos Aires]].

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat]]'' (literally, &quot;the arrival of a train at La Ciotat&quot;, but more commonly known as ''Arrival of a Train at a Station'') and ''[[Carmaux, défournage du coke]]'' (Drawing out the coke). Their [[actuality film]]s, or ''actualités'', are often cited as the first, primitive [[documentaries]]. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]''.

==Early color photography==

The brothers stated that &quot;the [[film|cinema]] is an [[invention]] without any future&quot; and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as [[Georges Méliès]]. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. They turned their attentions to colour photography and in 1903 they patented a colour photography process, the &quot;[[Autochrome Lumière]]&quot;, launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following its merger with [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]].

The Lumières also developed other products such as a loudspeaker, &quot;Lumière tulle gras&quot; (a dressing to heal burns) and the homonoid [[forceps]] (a medical tool).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Other early cinematographers==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2010}}
The Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific [[chronophotography]] devices developed by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, as was [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]], premiered in 1891. Since 1892, the projected drawings of [[Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] were attracting Paris crowds to the Museé Grevin. [[Louis Le Prince]] had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, [[Kazimierz Prószyński]] had built his camera and projecting device, called [[Pleograph]], in 1894. [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]], inventors of the [[Bioskope]], had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (November 1, 1895, in [[Berlin]]). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as one of the first inventors of Cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it. By comparison, it is argued that Thomas Edison may have meant his invention as entertainment for rich people, not as a movie to be seen in public.&lt;ref&gt;Michaël Abecassis, Revue de cinématrographie, 12, 2005, University of Rouen ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the book in the Christian New Testament|the literature genre|Acts of the Apostles (genre)|the acronym|ACTS (disambiguation)}}

{{Books of the New Testament}}
The '''Acts of the Apostles''' ({{lang-el|Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων}}, ''Práxeis tōn Apostólōn''; {{lang-la|Acta Apostolorum}}), usually referred to simply as '''Acts''', is the fifth book of the [[New Testament]]; Acts outlines the history of the [[Apostolic Age]]. The author is traditionally identified as [[Luke the Evangelist]], see [[Authorship of Luke-Acts]] for details.

==Composition==
{{Main|Authorship of Luke-Acts}}
[[File:ApostleFedorZubov.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ministry of the Apostles. [[Russian icons|Russian icon]] by [[Fyodor Zubov]], 1660.]]
While the precise identity of the author is debated, the consensus is that this work was composed by a ([[Koine]]) Greek speaking Gentile writing for an audience of [[Gentile Christians]].
The Early [[Church Fathers]] wrote that Luke was a physician in Antioch and an adherent of the Apostle Paul. It is said to be that the author of the Gospel of Luke is the same as the author of the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Patrick Halton, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=uqzY1zBtKg0C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22VII.+Luke+the+Evangelist%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22VII.%20Luke%20the%20Evangelist%22&amp;f=false On Illustrious Men], v. 100, CUA Press, 1999, pp. 15 - 16, ISBN 0-8132-0100-4. – See also the [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm Early Church Fathers], Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition holds that the text was written by [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke the companion of Paul]] (named in [[Colossians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Col|4:14}}) and this traditional view of Lukan authorship is “widely held as the view which most satisfactorily explains all the data.”&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), says the traditional view is “widely held as the view which most satisfactorily explains all the data.” p. 119, whereas R. E. Brown says opinion on the issue is &quot;evenly divided&quot; {{cite book |last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |authorlink=Raymond E. Brown |title=Introduction to the New Testament |year=1997 |publisher=Anchor Bible |location=New York |isbn=0-385-24767-2 |pages=267–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of scholars maintaining authorship by Luke the physician is lengthy, and represents scholars from a wide range of theological opinion.&lt;ref&gt;To list just some: I. H. Marshall, ''Acts'' (1980), pp. 44-45; F. F. Bruce, ''The Acts of the Apostles'' (1952), pp. 1-6; C. S. C. Williams, ''The Acts of the Apostles'', in ''Black’s New Testament Commentary'' (1957); W. Michaelis, ''Einleitung'', pp. 61-64; Bo Reicke, ''Glaube und Leben Der Urgenmeinde'' (1957), pp. 6-7; F. V. Filson, ''Three Crucial Decades'' (1963), p. 10; M. Dibelius, ''Studies in the Acts of the Apostles'' (1956); R. M. Grant, ''A Historical Introduction to the New Testament'' (1963), pp. 134-135; B. Gärtner, ''The Aeropagus Speech and Natural Revelation'' (1955), W. L. Knox, ''Sources of the Synoptic Gospels''; R. R. Williams, ''The Acts of the Apostles''; E. M. Blaiklock, ''The Acts of the Apostles'', in ''Tyndale New Testament Commentary'' (1959), W. Grundmann, ''Das Evangelium nach Lukas'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no consensus, and according to [[Raymond E. Brown]], the current opinion concerning Lukan authorship is ‘about evenly divided’.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown 1997 267–8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |authorlink=Raymond E. Brown |title=Introduction to the New Testament |year=1997 |publisher=Anchor Bible |location=New York |isbn=0-385-24767-2 |pages=267–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
The title &quot;Acts of the [[Apostles]]&quot; ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{Polytonic|Πράξεις ἀποστόλων}} ''Praxeis Apostolon'') was not part of the original text. It was first used by [[Irenaeus]] late in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]]. Some have suggested that the title &quot;Acts&quot; be interpreted as &quot;The Acts of the [[Holy Spirit]]&quot; or even &quot;The Acts of [[Jesus]],&quot; since 1:1 gives the impression that these acts were set forth as an account of what Jesus ''continued'' to do and teach, Jesus himself being the principal ''actor''.&lt;ref name = &quot;byewfo&quot;&gt;Carson, D. A., Moo, Douglas J. and Morris, Leon ''An Introduction to the New Testament'' (Leicester: Apollos, 1999), pp. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genre===
{{Main|Genre criticism}}
The word &quot;Acts&quot; denoted a recognized genre in the [[ancient world]], &quot;characterizing books that described great deeds of people or of cities.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;byewfo&quot;/&gt; There are several such books in the [[New Testament apocrypha]], including the [[Acts of Thomas]], the [[Acts of Andrew]], and the [[Acts of John]]. Initially the Gospel according to Luke and the book of the acts of the apostles formed a unique work; it was only when the gospels began to be compiled together that the initial work was split into two volumes with the aforementioned titles.

Modern scholars assign a wide range of genres to the Acts of the Apostles, including [[biography]], [[novel]] and [[history]]. Most, however, interpret the genre as epic stories of early Christian miracles and conversions.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Thomas E. &quot;The Genre of Acts: Moving Toward a Consensus?&quot; ''Currents in Biblical Research'' 4 [2006] 365 - 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
{{Main|Source criticism}}
[[File:Codex laudianus.jpg|thumb|right|Acts 15:22–24 from the 7th-century ''[[Codex Laudianus]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]], written in parallel columns of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].]]

The author of Acts likely relied upon other sources, as well as [[historical method#Oral tradition|oral tradition]], in constructing his account of the early church and Paul's ministry. Evidence for this is found in the [[prologue]] to the [[Gospel of Luke]], wherein the author alludes to his sources by writing, &quot;Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.&quot; Some scholars theorize that the &quot;we&quot; passages in Acts are just such &quot;handed down&quot; quotations from some earlier source who accompanied Paul on his travels.

It is generally believed{{By whom|date=April 2011}} that the author of Acts did not have access to a collection of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]]. One piece of evidence suggesting this is that, although half of Acts centers on Paul, Acts never directly quotes from the Pauline epistles nor does it even mention Paul writing letters. Discrepancies between the Pauline epistles and Acts{{Which?|date=April 2011}} further supports the conclusion that the author of Acts did not have access to those epistles when composing Acts.

Other theories about Acts' sources are more controversial. Some historians believe that Acts borrows phraseology and plot elements from [[Euripides]]' play [[The Bacchae]].&lt;ref&gt;Randel McCram Helms (1997) ''Who Wrote The Gospels''&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that the text of Acts shows evidence of having used the Jewish historian [[Josephus]] as a source (in which case it would have to have been written sometime after 94 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mason | first=Steve | title=Josephus and the New Testament | year=2003 | publisher=Hendrickson | place=Peabody, Mass. | pages=185–229 | isbn=1-56563-795-X | edition=2nd}} [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/lukeandjosephus.html Luke and Josephus]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, R. I. Pervo dates Acts to the first quarter of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acts was written c. 115 by an anonymous author whose perspective was that of Ephesus or its general environs&quot;, ''Acts: a commentary'', R. I. Pervo, 2009, edited by Harold W. Attridge, ''Hermeneia-A critical and Historical on the Bible'', Fortress press, Minneapolis&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
{{Main|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}
The question of authorship is largely bound up with the one of the historical value of the contents. A key contested issue is the historicity of Luke's depiction of Paul. According to the majority viewpoint, Acts describes Paul differently from how he describes himself, both factually and theologically.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acts presents a picture of Paul that differs from his own description of himself in many of his letters, both factually and theologically.&quot; biblical literature (2010). In Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved November 25, 2010, from Encyclopedia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature/73440/The-Acts-of-the-Apostles?anchor=ref598122].&lt;/ref&gt; Acts differs with Paul's letter on important issues, such as the [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Law]], Paul's own [[Apostle (Christian)#The Apostle to the Gentiles: Paul of Tarsus|apostleship]], and his relation to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;That an actual companion of Paul writing about his mission journeys could be in so much disagreement with Paul (whose theology is evidenced in his letters) about fundamental issues such as the Law, his apostleship, and his relationship to the Jerusalem church is hardly conceivable.&quot; biblical literature (2010). In Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved November 25, 2010, from Encyclopedia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature/73440/The-Acts-of-the-Apostles?anchor=ref598122].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paul's own account is generally regarded as the more reliable.&quot; [[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Representing a traditional view, however, some prominent scholars and historians view the book of Acts as being quite accurate and corroborated by [[archaeology]], while agreeing with the [[Pauline epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;Strobel, Lee. ”The Case for Christ”. 1998, Ch five when quoting John McRay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, F.F. (1981). &quot;The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?&quot; Ch. 7-8. InterVarsity.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Date===
{{Main|Dating the Bible}}
The book of Acts has been most commonly dated to the second half of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]]. [[Norman Geisler]] dates it as early as between 60-62.&lt;ref name=geisler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/resource.php?ID=233 |title=The Dating of the New Testament |work=bethinking.org |accessdate=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Guthrie]], who dates the book between 62-64,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errantskeptics.org/DatingNT.htm &quot;Dating the New Testament&quot;], (accessed April 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the absence of any mention of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 would be unlikely if the book were written afterward. He also suggested that since the book does not mention the death of Paul, a central character in the final chapters, it was likely penned before his death.&lt;ref name=Guthrie1&gt;{{cite book| last = Guthrie
| first = Donald | authorlink = Donald Guthrie | title = New Testament Introduction| origyear = 1970| origmonth = December| edition = third| publisher = InterVarsity Press| location = Downer's Grove, IL | isbn = 0-87784-953-6 | pages = 340–345| chapter = Nine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie also saw traces of Acts in [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians]] (written between 110-140) and one letter by [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] († about 117)&lt;ref&gt;The suggested traces can be found at [http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml#Gospel_of_Luke Ignatius] and [http://www.ntcanon.org/Polycarp.shtml#Acts Polycarp]. The resemblance of Acts 13:22 and [[First Epistle of Clement|First Clement]] 18:1, in features not found in [[Psalms]] 89:20 quoted by each, can hardly be accidental; the date of Ignatius depends on later synchronisms with [[Trajan]], which are disputable.&lt;/ref&gt; and thought that Acts probably was current in Antioch and [[İzmir|Smyrna]] not later than c. 115, and perhaps in Rome as early as c. 96.&lt;ref name=Guthrie2&gt;{{cite book| last = Guthrie| first = Donald| title = New Testament Introduction| origyear = 1970| origmonth = December| edition = third| publisher = InterVarsity Press| location = Downer's Grove, IL| isbn = 0-87784-953-6| pages = 347–348| chapter = Nine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small indicator about the earliest possible date may be in {{Bibleref2|Acts|6:9}} which mentions the Province of [[Cilicia]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province by that name had been on hiatus from 27 BC and re-established by Emperor Vespasian only in 72 AD.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of the Roman Empire. By Matthew Bunson. ISBN 0-19-510233-9. See page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Paul was from Cilicia and refers to himself using this name (see Acts 21:39, 22:3), it seems very natural that the name Cilicia would have continued to be in colloquial use among its residents despite its hiatus in official Roman nomenclature.

Parallels between Acts and [[Josephus]]' [[The Wars of the Jews]] (written in 75-80) and [[Antiquities of the Jews]] (c. 94) have long been argued.&lt;ref name= carrier&gt;[[Richard Carrier]], [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/lukeandjosephus.html Luke and Josephus (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have argued that Acts used material of both of Josephus' works, rather than the other way around, which would indicate that Acts was written around the year 100 or later.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, ''Josephus and the New Testament'', Hendrickson Publishers: Peabody, Massachusetts, 1992, pp. 185-229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Eisenman]] argues for the hypothesis that Acts used material from Josephus in his [http://youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=EisenmanLecture Cal State lecture series on the historical Jesus], cf. Robert Eisenman, ''[[James the Brother of Jesus (book)|James the Brother of Jesus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three points of contact with Josephus in particular are cited: (1) The circumstances attending the death of [[Agrippa I]] in 44. Here Acts 12:21-23 is largely parallel to Antiquities 19.8.2; (2) the cause of the Egyptian pseudo-prophet in Acts 21:37f and in Josephus (War 2.13.5; Antiquities 20.8.6); (3) the curious resemblance as to the order in which [[Theudas]] and [[Judas of Galilee]] are referred to in both (Acts 5:36f; Antiquities 20.5.1).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

According to John T. Townsend, &quot;it is not before the last decades of the second century that one finds undisputed traces of the work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John T. Townsend, &quot;The Date of Luke-Acts,&quot; in; Charles H. Talbert, ''Luke-Acts: New Perspectives from the Society of Biblical Literature Seminar'' (New York: Crossroad, 1984), pp. 47-62; here p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend, turning to the sources behind the [[Clementine literature|pseudo-Clementine writings]], argues that the middle of the 2nd century is the terminus ad quem for the final composition. According to Richard I. Pervo, &quot;Townsend's methodologically adventurous but ultimately cautious essay is another valuable lesson in the danger of establishing the date of Acts–or any work–by arguing for the earliest possible time of origin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard I. Pervo, ''Dating Acts: Between the Evangelists and the Apologists'' (Santa Rosa, California: Polebridge Press, 2006), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place===
The place of composition is still an open question. For some time Rome and Antioch have been in favor, and Blass combined both views in his theory of two editions. But internal evidence points strongly to the [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman province of Asia]], particularly the neighborhood of [[Ephesus]]. Note the confident local allusion in 19:9 to &quot;the school of Tyrannus&quot; and in 19:33 to &quot;Alexander&quot;; also the very minute topography in 20:13–15. At any rate affairs in that region, including the future of the church of Ephesus (20:28–30), are treated as though they would specially interest &quot;Theophilus&quot; and his circle; also an early tradition makes Luke die in the adjacent [[Bithynia]]. Finally it was in this region that there arose certain early glosses (e.g., 19:9; 20:15), probably the earliest of those referred to below. How fully in correspondence with such an environment the work would be, as apologia for the Church against the Synagogue's attempts to influence Roman policy to its harm, must be clear to all familiar with the strength of Judaism in Asia (cf. [[Book of Revelation|Rev]] 2:9, 3:9; and see Sir W. M. Ramsay, ''The Letters to the Seven Churches'', ch. xii.).

===Manuscripts===
{{Main|Biblical manuscript}}
[[File:Minuscule 223 (GA) f11r.jpg|thumb|Acts 1:1-2a from the 14th century [[Minuscule 223]]]]
Like most biblical books, there are differences between the earliest surviving manuscripts of Acts. In the case of Acts, however, the differences between the surviving manuscripts are more substantial. The two earliest versions of manuscripts are the [[Western text-type]] (as represented by the [[Codex Bezae]]) and the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (as represented by the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]). The version of Acts preserved in the Western manuscripts contains about 10% more content than the Alexandrian version of Acts. Since the difference is so great, scholars have struggled to determine which of the two versions is closer to the original text composed by the original author.

The earliest explanation, suggested by Swiss theologian [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean LeClerc]] in the 17th century, posits that the longer Western version was a first draft, while the Alexandrian version represents a more polished revision by the same author. Adherents of this theory argue that even when the two versions diverge, they both have similarities in vocabulary and writing style—suggesting that the two shared a common author. However, it has been argued that if both texts were written by the same individual, they should have exactly identical theologies and they should agree on historical questions. Since most modern scholars do detect subtle theological and historical differences between the texts, most scholars do not subscribe to the rough-draft/polished-draft theory – res ipsa loquitur.

A second theory assumes common authorship of the Western and Alexandrian texts, but claims the Alexandrian text is the short first draft, and the Western text is a longer polished draft. A third theory is that the longer Western text came first, but that later, some other redactor abbreviated some of the material, resulting in the shorter Alexandrian text.

While these other theories still have a measure of support, the modern consensus is that the shorter Alexandrian text is closer to the original, and the longer Western text is the result of later insertion of additional material into the text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/Tyndale/staff/Head/TextofActs.htm The Text of Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;
Already in 1893, Sir [[W. M. Ramsay]] in ''The Church in the Roman Empire'' held that the [[Codex Bezae]] (the Western text) rested on a recension made in Asia Minor (somewhere between [[Ephesus]] and southern [[Galatia]]), not later than about the middle of the 2nd century. Though &quot;some at least of the alterations in Codex Bezae arose through a gradual process, and not through the action of an individual reviser,&quot; the revision in question was the work of a single reviser, who in his changes and additions expressed the local interpretation put upon Acts in his own time. His aim, in suiting the text to the views of his day, was partly to make it more intelligible to the public, and partly to make it more complete. To this end he &quot;added some touches where surviving tradition seemed to contain trustworthy additional particulars,&quot; such as the statement that Paul taught in the lecture-room of Tyrannus &quot;from the fifth to the tenth hour&quot; (added to Acts 19:9). In his later work, ''St Paul the Traveller and the Roman Citizen'' (1895), Ramsay's views gain both in precision and in breadth. The gain lies chiefly in seeing beyond the Bezan text to the &quot;Western&quot; text as a whole.

It is believed that the material in the Western text which isn't in the Alexandrian text reflects later theological developments within Christianity. For examples, the Western text features a greater [[Anti-Judaism|hostility to Judaism]] and a more positive attitude towards [[Pauline Christianity|Gentile Christianity]]. Some also note that the Western text attempts to minimize the emphasis Acts places on the role of women in the early Christian church.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009|reason = dead link: http://www.bibletexts.com/terms/tr-wtext.htm }}

A third class of manuscripts, known as the [[Byzantine text-type]], is often considered to have developed after the Western and Alexandrian types. While differing from both of the other types, the Byzantine type has more similarity to the Alexandrian than to the Western type. The extant manuscripts of this type date from the 5th century or later; however, papyrus fragments show that this text-type may date as early as the Alexandrian or Western text-types.&lt;ref&gt;Such as P66 and P75. See: [[Ernst Cadman Colwell|E. C. Colwell]], ''Hort Redivisus: A Plea and a Program,'' Studies in Methodology in Textual Criticism of the New Testament, Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1969, p. 45-48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine text-type served as the basis for the 16th century [[Textus Receptus]], the second Greek-language version of the New Testament to be printed by printing press. The Textus Receptus, in turn, served as the basis for the New Testament found in the English-language [[King James Bible]]. Today, the Byzantine text-type is the subject of renewed interest as the possible original form of the text from which the Western and Alexandrian text-types were derived.&lt;ref&gt;See: Robinson, Maurice A. and Pierpont, William G., ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'', (2005) ISBN 0-7598-0077-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==General presentation==
Acts tells the story of the [[Apostolic Age]] of the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] church, with particular emphasis on the ministry of the [[Apostle (Christian)#The Twelve Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] and of [[Saint Paul|Paul of Tarsus]]. The early chapters, set in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], discuss Jesus' [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and [[Great Commission]], his [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] with a [[Second Coming|prophecy to return]], the start of the Twelve Apostles' ministry, and the [[Pentecost|Day of Pentecost]]. The later chapters discuss Paul's conversion, his ministry, and finally his arrest and imprisonment and trip to [[Rome]].

===Structure===
{{Main|Cluster criticism}}
&lt;!-- shorten; edit for clarity --&gt;
The structure of the book of Luke&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Gooding, David W., ''According to Luke'', (1987) ISBN 0-85110-756-7&lt;/ref&gt; is closely tied with the structure of Acts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Gooding, David W., ''True to the Faith'', (1990) ISBN 0-340-52563-0&lt;/ref&gt; Both books are most easily tied to the geography of the book. Luke begins with a global perspective, dating the birth of Jesus to the reign of the [[Roman emperors]] in Luke 2:1 and 3:1. From there we see Jesus' ministry move from Galilee (chapters 4–9), through Samaria and Judea (chs. 10–19), to Jerusalem where he is [[Crucifixion|crucified]], raised and ascended into [[heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] (chs. 19–24).
The book of Acts follows just the opposite motion, taking the scene from Jerusalem (chs. 1–5), to Judea and Samaria (chs. 6–9), then traveling through [[Syria]], Asia Minor, and [[Europe]] towards Rome (chs. 9–28). This [[chiastic structure]] emphasizes the centrality of the [[resurrection]] and ascension to Luke's message, while emphasizing the universal nature of the gospel.

This geographic structure is foreshadowed in Acts 1:8, where Jesus says &quot;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem (chs. 1–5), and in all Judea and Samaria (chs. 6–9), and even to the remotest part of the earth (chs. 10–28).&quot; The first two sections (chs. 1–9) represent the witness of the apostles to the Jews, while the last section (chs. 10–28) represent the witness of the apostles to the Gentiles.

The book of Acts can also be broken down by the major characters of the book. While the complete title of the book is the Acts of the Apostles, really the book focuses on only two men: The Apostle Peter (chs. 1–12) and St. Paul (chs. 13–28).

Within this structure, the sub-points of the book are marked by a series of summary statements, or what one commentary calls a &quot;progress report&quot;. Just before the geography of the scene shifts to a new location, Luke summarizes how the gospel has impacted that location. The standard for these progress reports is in 2:46–47, where Luke describes the impact of the gospel on the new church in Jerusalem. The remaining progress reports are located:

*Acts 6:7 Impact of the gospel in Jerusalem.
*9:31 Impact of the gospel in Judea and Samaria.
*12:24 Impact of the gospel in Syria.
*16:5 Impact of the gospel in Asia Minor.
*19:20 Impact of the gospel in Europe.
*28:31 Impact of the gospel on Rome.

This structure can be also seen as a series of concentric circles, where the gospel begins in the center, Jerusalem, and is expanding ever outward to Judea &amp; Samaria, Syria, Asia Minor, Europe, and eventually to Rome.

==Overview==
[[File:Jelling Kirke 9 Apostle.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Six [[apostles]], from the [[Jelling]] church, [[Denmark]].]]
The author opens with a prologue, usually taken to be addressed to an individual by the name of Theophilus (though this name, which translates literally as &quot;God-lover&quot;, may be a nickname rather than a personal appellation) and references &quot;my earlier book&quot;—almost certainly the Gospel of Luke. This is immediately followed by a narrative which is set in Jerusalem.

===Peter and the apostles===
{{Main|Jewish Christians}}
[[File:Jerusalem Cenacle BW 5.JPG|thumb|The [[Cenacle]] on [[Mount Zion]], claimed to be the location of the [[Last Supper]] and [[Pentecost]]. [[Bargil Pixner]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixner&quot;&gt;Bargil Pixner, ''[http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html The Church of the Apostles found on Mount Zion]'', [[Biblical Archaeology Review]] 16.3 May/June 1990&lt;/ref&gt; claims the original [[Church of the Apostles]] is located under the current structure.]]

The apostles, along with other followers of Jesus, meet and elect Matthias to replace Judas as a member of The Twelve. On [[Pentecost]], the [[Holy Spirit]] descends on them. The apostles hear a great wind and witness &quot;tongues of flames&quot; descending on them, paralleling {{bibleverse||Luke|3:16-17}}. Thereafter, the apostles have the miraculous power to &quot;[[Glossolalia|speak in tongues]]&quot; and when they address a crowd, each member of the crowd hears their speech in his own native language.

Peter, along with John, preaches to many in Jerusalem, and performs many miracles such as healings, the [[Exorcism|casting out of evil spirits]], and the [[Resurrection of the dead|raising of the dead]]. As a result, thousands convert to [[Early Christianity]] and are baptized.

As their numbers increase, the Christians begin to be increasingly [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament|persecuted]]. Some of the apostles are arrested and flogged, but ultimately freed. [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], one of the first deacons, is arrested for [[blasphemy]], and after a trial, is found guilty and [[Stoning|executed by stoning]] by the Jews, thereby becoming the first known Christian [[martyr]].

Peter and the apostles continue to preach, and Christianity continues to grow, and begins to spread to [[Gentiles]]. Peter has a vision in which a voice commands him to eat a variety of impure animals. When Peter objects, the voice replies, &quot;Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.&quot; When Peter awakes from his vision, he meets with [[Cornelius the Centurion]], who converts. Peter baptizes the centurion, and later has to justify this decision to the other Christians.

===Paul's ministry===
{{Main|Paul of Tarsus|Redaction criticism}}
Paul of Tarsus, also known as Saul, is the main character of the second half of Acts. He is introduced as a persecutor of the Christian church ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|8:1:3}}), until his conversion to Christianity later in the chapter when he encounters the resurrected Christ. His own account of his conversion, {{bibleverse||Gal|1:11-24}}, is not detailed. The [[conversion of Paul]] on the road to Damascus is told three times. While Paul was on the road to Damascus, near Damascus, &quot;suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|Acts 9:3-4}}), the light was &quot;brighter than the sun&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|26:13}}) and he was subsequently blinded for three days ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|9:9}}). He heard a voice in the Hebrew language (probably [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]]): &quot;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? ... I am Jesus&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|26:14-15}}). In Damascus, [[Ananias of Damascus|St. Ananias]] cured his blindness, &quot;something like scales&quot; fell from his eyes, and baptized him ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|9:17-19}}). It is commonly believed that Saul changes his name to Paul at this time, but the source of this claim is unknown, the first mention of another name is later ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:9}}), during his first missionary journey.

Several years later, [[Barnabas]] and Paul set out on a mission (13-14) to further spread Christianity, particularly among the Gentiles. Paul travels through [[Asia Minor]], preaching and visiting churches throughout the region.

===Council of Jerusalem===
{{main|Council of Jerusalem}}
Paul travels to Jerusalem where he meets with the apostles — a meeting known as the Council of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15}}). Paul's own record of the meeting appears to be [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians 2]], however, due to the differences, some argue Gal 2 is a different meeting. Members of the Jerusalem church have been preaching that [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] is required for salvation. Paul and his associates strongly disagree. After much discussion, [[Saint James the Just|James the Just]], leader of the Jerusalem church, decrees that Gentile Christian converts need not follow all of the [[613 Mitzvot|Mosaic Law]], and in particular, they do not need to be circumcised.

The decision of the Council came to be called the ''[[Apostolic Decree]]'' ({{bibleverse||Acts|15:19-21}}) and was that most ''Mosaic law'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish law]] or ''Halakha'' was formalized later, see [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&amp;letter=J&amp;search=Jesus#1000 Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus of Nazareth: Attitude Toward the Law]: &quot;Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the Halakah was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of the [[Hillel and Shammai|Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai]] were occurring about the time of his maturity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; including the requirement for circumcision of males, was not obligatory for [[Gentile]] converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|15:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against eating meat containing [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]], or meat of animals not properly slain, and against &quot;[[fornication]]&quot; and [[Idolatry|idol worship]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html Commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: &quot;We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force.

With the [[Greek Orthodox|Greeks]], indeed, it continued always in force as their [[euchology|Euchologies]] still show. [[Theodore Balsamon|Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few.

But still, as late as the 8th century, Pope Gregory the Third 731 forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuser, like other laws.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Faust'', 32.13&lt;/ref&gt; many have seen a connection to [[Noahide Law]], while some modern scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example: [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], ''The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)'', Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), ISBN 0-300-13982-9, chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; reject the connection to ''Noahide Law'' ({{bibleverse||Genesis|9}}) and instead see {{bibleverse||Lev|17-18}} as the basis. See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Old Testament Law directed at non-Jews]] and [[Leviticus 18]]. In effect, however, the Jerusalem Church created a double standard: one for [[Jewish Christians]] and one for Gentile converts. See [[Dual-covenant theology]] for the modern debate.

Paul spends the next few years traveling through western Asia Minor and (some believe) founds his first Christian church in [[Philippi]]. Paul then travels to [[Thessalonica]], where he stays for some time before departing for [[Greece]]. In [[Athens]], Paul visits an altar with an inscription dedicated to an unknown god,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|17:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; so when he gives his speech on the [[Areios Pagos|Areopagos]], he proclaims to worship that same unknown god whom he identifies as the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]].

Upon Paul's arrival in Jerusalem, he was confronted with the rumor of teaching against the [[Halakha|Law of Moses]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:21}}). Perhaps to show that he was &quot;living in obedience to the law&quot;, Paul took a [[Nazirite|biblical vow]] along with some others ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:26}}). Near the end of the days of the vow, Paul was recognized outside [[Herod's Temple]] and was nearly beaten to death by a ''mob'', &quot;shouting, 'Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place'&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:28}}). Paul is rescued from the ''mob'' by a Roman commander ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:31-40}}) and accused of being a [[zealot|revolutionary]], &quot;ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes&quot;, teaching [[resurrection of the dead]], and thus imprisoned in [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts||23–26}}). Paul asserts his right, as a Roman citizen, to be tried in Rome. Paul is sent by sea to Rome, where he spends another two years under house arrest, proclaiming the [[Kingdom of God]] and teaching the &quot;Lord Jesus Christ&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|28:30-31}}). Surprisingly, Acts does not record the outcome of Paul's legal troubles — some traditions hold that Paul was ultimately executed in Rome, while other traditions have him surviving the encounter and later traveling to Spain — see [[Paul of Tarsus#Paul's trip to Rome, imprisonment and death|Paul - Imprisonment &amp; Death]].

===Universality of Christianity===
One of the central themes of Acts, indeed of the New Testament (see also [[Great Commission]]) is the universality of Christianity—the idea that Jesus's teachings were for all humanity—[[Jews]] and Gentiles alike. In this view, Christianity is seen as a religion in its own right, rather than a subset of Judaism, if one makes the common assumption that Judaism is not universal, however see [[Noahide Laws]] and [[Christianity and Judaism]] for details. Whereas the members of [[Jewish Christianity]] were circumcised and adhered to dietary laws, the [[Pauline Christianity]] featured in Acts did not require Gentiles to be circumcised or to obey all of the [[613 Mitzvot|Mosaic laws]], which is consistent with Noahide Law. The final chapter of Acts ends with Paul condemning non-Christian Jews and saying &quot;Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|28:28}}). See also [[New Covenant (theology)]].

===Holy Spirit===
As in the Gospel of Luke, there are numerous references to the Holy Spirit throughout Acts. Acts features the &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit&quot; on Pentecost&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Acts.htm Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 11:15-16 according to here]&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent spirit-inspired speaking in tongues. The Holy Spirit is shown guiding the decisions and actions of Christian leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15:28; 16:6-7; 19:21; 20:22-23 according to [http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Acts.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Holy Spirit is said to &quot;fill&quot; the apostles, especially when they preach.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 1:8; 2:4; 4:8, 31; 11:24; 13:9, 52 according to [http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Acts.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Acts is particularly influential among branches of Christianity which place particular emphasis in the Holy Spirit, such as [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic movement]].

===Attention to the oppressed and persecuted===
The Gospel of Luke and Acts both devote a great deal of attention to the oppressed and downtrodden. The impoverished are generally praised,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. &quot;Preach good news to the poor&quot; (Luke 4:18), &quot;Blessed are the poor&quot; (Luke 6:20–21), [http://www.apuritansmind.com/Stewardship/NorthbrookWarrenLukeRichPoor.htm Luke's Attitude Towards Rich and Poor]&lt;/ref&gt; while the wealthy are criticized. Luke-Acts devotes a great deal of attention to women in general&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1, Luke 2&lt;/ref&gt; and to widows in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 2:37; 4:25-26; 7:12; 18:3, 5; 20:47; 21:2-3)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samaritans]] of [[Samaria]] (see map at [[Iudaea Province]]), had their temple on [[Mount Gerizim]], and along with some other differences, see [[Samaritanism]], were in conflict with Jews of [[Judea]] and [[Galilee]] and other regions who had their [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and practiced [[Judaism]]. Unexpectedly, since Jesus was a Jewish Galilean, the Samaritans are shown favorably in [[Luke-Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37), the story of the Samaritan who expressed gratitude to Jesus for being healed (Luke 17:11-19), and the entrance of the Samaritans into the church of God (Acts 8:4-25).&lt;/ref&gt; In Acts, attention is given to the religious persecution of the early Christians, as in the case of Stephen's martyrdom and the numerous examples are Paul's persecution for his preaching of Christianity.

===Prayer===
Prayer is a major motif in both the Gospel of Luke and Acts. Both books have a more prominent attention to prayer than is found in the other gospels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3817/is_200012/ai_n8916000 Theology of prayer in the gospel of Luke]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Luke depicts prayer as a certain feature in Jesus's life. Examples of prayer which are unique to Luke include Jesus's prayers at the time of his baptism ({{bibleverse||Luke|3:21}}), his praying all night before choosing the twelve ({{bibleverse||Luke|6:12}}), and praying for the transfiguration ({{bibleverse||Luke|9:28}}). Acts also features an emphasis on prayer and includes a number of notable prayers such as the ''Believers' Prayer'' ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|4:23-31}}), Stephen's death prayer ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|7:59-60}}), and Simon Magus' prayer ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|8:24}}). See also [[Prayer in the New Testament]].

===Speeches===
Acts features a number of extended speeches or sermons from Peter, Paul, and others. In fact, there are at least 24 different speeches in Acts, and the speeches comprise about 30% of the total verses.&lt;ref&gt;Listed [http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/lukespeech.html here]. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kmA8jb6M Archived] 2009-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; These speeches, which are quoted verbatim at length rather than simply summarized, have been the source of debates over the historical accuracy of Acts. Some scholars have objected to the language of the speeches as too Lukan in style to reflect anyone else's words. George Shillington writes that the author of Acts most likely created the speeches accordingly and they bare his literary and theological marks.&lt;ref&gt;V. George Shillington, An introduction to the study of Luke-Acts, Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 18. 2007 ISBN 0567030539&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Howard Marshall writes that the speeches were not entirely the inventions of the author and while they may not be accurate word-for-word, the author nevertheless records the general idea of them. He compares this to the work of the historian [[Thucydides]] who found it difficult recording speeches verbatim but instead made the speakers say what he felt was appropriate for them to say on the occasion while adhering as much as possible to the general sense of what they said.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Marshall, The Acts of the Apostles: an introduction and commentary, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1980, pg. 42. ISBN 0802814239 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Mesopotamia}}
'''Assyria''' was a Semitic [[Akkadian]] kingdom centered on the Upper [[Tigris]] river, in northern [[Mesopotamia]] (present day northern     [[Iraq]]), that came to rule regional empires a number of times through history. It was named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]] ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: {{lang|akk|𒀸𒋗𒁺 𐎹 ''Aššūrāyu''}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|أشور}} ''{{lang|arLatn|Aššûr}}''; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אַשּׁוּר}} ''{{lang|he-Latn|Aššûr}}'', [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: {{lang|syc|ܐܬ݂ܘܿܪ}} ''{{lang|arc-Latn| Aṯur}}''). Assyria was also sometimes known as [[Subartu]]. The term ''Assyria'' can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where these empires were centered. Their descendants still live in the region today, and they form the Christian minority in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;H.W.F. Saggs&quot;&gt;Saggs, ''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', pp. 290, &amp;ldquo;The destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers, and since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, descendants of the Assyrian peasants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Akkadian Empire]] circa 2080 BC, it eventually coalesced into two separate nations; Assyria in the north, and later [[Babylonia]] in the south.

Assyria was originally a minor [[Akkadian]] kingdom which evolved in the 23rd to 21st Centuries BC. Originally, the early Assyrian kings would certainly have been regional leaders only, and subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]] who united all the Akkadian speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]] which lasted from 2334 BC to 2154 BC. The Akkadian nation of Assyria (and later on also Babylonia) evolved  from the dissolution of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. In the Old Assyrian period of the [[Early Bronze Age]], Assyria had been a kingdom of northern Mesopotamia (modern-day northern [[Iraq]]), competing for dominance with its fellow [[Akkadian]] speaking southern Mesopotamian rival, [[Babylonia]] which was often under [[Kassite]] rule. During this period it established colonies in [[Asia Minor]]. It had experienced fluctuating fortunes in the Middle Assyrian period. Assyria had a period of empire under [[Shamshi-Adad I]] in the 18th and 17th Centuries BC, following this it found itself under short periods of [[Babylonian]] and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the 17th and 15th Centuries BC respectively, and another period of great power and empire from 1365 BC to 1076 BC, that included the reigns of great kings such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC, it again became a great power, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Urartu]]/[[Armenians|Armenia]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Mannea]], [[Gutium]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Canaan]], [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), [[Arabia]], [[Israel]], [[Judah]], [[Palestine]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Samarra]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chaldea]], [[Nabatea]], [[Commagene]], [[Dilmun]] and the [[Hurrians]], [[Sutu]] and neo [[Hittites]], driving the [[Nubians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Ethiopians]] from Egypt, defeating the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and exacting tribute from [[Phrygia]], [[Magan]] and [[Punt]] among others.

==Early history==
In prehistoric times the region was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at [[Shanidar]]. The earliest [[neolithic]] site in Assyria is at [[Hassuna|Tell Hassuna]], the center of the ''Hassuna culture'', circa 6000 BC. The city of [[Assur]] ([[Ashur]]) seems to have existed since at least the middle of the third millenium BC, although it appears to have been an administrative center at this time rather than an independent state. Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. The earliest king named [[Tudiya]] who was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]], appears to have lived in the 23rd century BC, according to the [[Assyrian King List]]. Ibrium concluded a treaty with Tudiya of Assyria for the use of a trading post officially controlled by Ebla. He was succeeded by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers, all of whom nothing is known. These early kings from the 23rd to late 21st centuries BC, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'' were likely to have been semi nomadic pasturalist rulers who dominated the region and at some unknown point during this period became urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]]. According to some [[Judaeo-Christian]] traditions, the city of [[Ashur]] (also spelled [[Assur]] or Aššur) was founded by [[Ashur (Bible)|Ashur]] the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god, however there is absolutely no historical basis whatsoever for this tradition in Mesopotamian annals; Assyrian tradition itself lists an early Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] as having dedicated the first temple to the god [[Ashur]] in the city in the 21st century BC, it is not known if he was the first fully independent ruler of Assyria as a ''city state'' however, as no records have yet been discovered regarding earlier kings. It is likely that the city was named in honour of the god of the same name. The upper [[Tigris]] River valley seems to have been ruled by [[Sumerians]] and later [[Akkad]] in early antiquity. The [[Akkadian Empire]] of [[Sargon the Great]] claimed to encompass the surrounding &quot;four quarters&quot;; the regions north of the Akkadian homeland had been known as [[Subartu]]. The name ''Azuhinum'' in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper. The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by [[barbarian]] [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC, then rebuilt, and ended up being governed as part of the Empire of the [[Sumerian]]  [[3rd dynasty of Ur]] founded in 2112 BC. The rulers of Assyria during the period between 2154 BC and 2112 BC may have been fully independent as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia, however there is no information from Assyria bar the king list for this period. Prior to Ushpia, the city of Ashur was a regional administrative center of  Akkadian rulers, implicated by [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Shendge1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170173250|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;, subject to their fellow Akkadian Sargon and his successors.

==Old Assyrian Period==
The Assyrian King List mentions rulers going back to the 23rd and 22nd century BC, however little is known of these kings, although [[Tudiya]] who reigned in the 23rd century BC appears to have established relations with [[Ibrium]], king of [[Ebla]]. These early kings were more than likely local Akkadian rulers subject to the [[Akkadian Empire]] and later [[Sumerian]] domination. The first inscriptions of Assyrian rulers appear in the late 21st Century BC. Assyria then consisted of a number of city states and small [[Semitic]] [[Akkadian]] kingdoms. The foundation of the first true urbanised Assyrian monarchy was traditionally ascribed to [[Ushpia]] a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Larsa]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Assyrian King List]] and Georges Roux-Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; circa 2025 BC. He was succeeded in succession by [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] of whom nothing is known.

In around 2000 BC [[Puzur-Ashur I]] founded a new dynasty, and his successors such as [[Shalim-ahum]], [[Ilushuma]], [[Erishum I]] and [[Sargon I]] left inscriptions regarding the building of temples to [[Ashur]], [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria.
[[Ilushuma]] in particular appears to have been a powerful king who made many raids into southern [[Mesopotamia]] between 1953 BC and 1935 BC, attacking the independent city states of the region and founding colonies in [[Asia Minor]]. This was to become a pattern throughout the history of ancient Mesopotamia with the future rivalry between Assyria and Babylonia. However, Babylonia did not exist at this time, but was founded 1n 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] prince named [[Sumuabum]] during the reign of Erishum I. The Amorites had overrun southern Mesopotamia from the mid 20th century BC, deposing native Sumero-Akkadian dynasties and setting up their own kingdoms, but were repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BC.

The city-state of Ashur had extensive contact with cities on the [[Anatolia]]n plateau in [[Asia Minor]]. The Assyrians established colonies in [[Cappadocia]], (''e.g.,'' at [[Kanesh]] (modern [[Kültepe]]) from 1920 BC to 1740 BC. These colonies, called ''karum'', the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Anatolian cities, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metal (perhaps lead or tin; the terminology here is not entirely clear) and textiles from Assyria, that were traded for precious metals in Anatolia.

Like many city-states in Mesopotamian history, Assur was, to a great extent, an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with &quot;the City&quot;, and the polity had three main centres of power&amp;nbsp;— an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual [[Akkadians|Akkadian]] term for &quot;king&quot;, ''šarrum''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Assur (god)|Assur]], of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as &quot;the steward of Assur&quot; (''iššiak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from [[Sumerians|Sumerian]] ''[[ENSI|ensi(k)]]''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the [[archons of Athens|archons]] and [[Roman consul|consuls]] of [[Classical Antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''iššiak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Mogens Trolle (2000): The old Assyrian city-state. In Hansen, Mogens Herman, A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures : an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre. P.77-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Refers to entire paragraph on political structure--&gt;

===Empire of Shamshi-Adad I===

In 1813 BC the native Akkadian king of Assyria [[Erishum II]] was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (1813 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1791 BC) in the expansion of [[Amorite]] tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta. Although regarded as an Amorite, Shamshi-Adad is credited with decendancy from the native ruler Ushpia in the Assyrian King List. He put his son [[Ishme-Dagan]] on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, [[Ekallatum]], and maintained Assyria's Anatolian colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] on the [[Euphrates]] putting another of his sons, [[Yasmah-Adad]] on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in [[Asia Minor]] and northern [[Syria]]. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley, called [[Shubat-Enlil]].

[[Ishme-Dagan]] inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called [[Zimrilim]] in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with king [[Hammurabi]], who had made the recently created state of [[Babylon]] a major power. Hammurabi was also an [[Amorite]]. Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the [[Turukku]] in [[Ekallatum]] (successors of the [[Gutians]] and [[Lullubi]]), and against [[Dadusha]], king of [[Eshnunna]] and [[Iamhad]] (modern [[Aleppo]])

===Assyria under Babylonian domination===
Hammurabi after first conquering [[Mari]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]] eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan's successors, and conquered Assyria for Babylon in 1756 BC. With Hammurabi, the various ''karum'' colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity&amp;nbsp;— probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan; [[Mut-Ashkur]] (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a [[Hurrian]] queen), [[Rimush]] and [[Asinum]] were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians for a few decades.

===Assyrian independence===
Babylonia seems to have lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor [[Samsu-iluna]]. A period of civil war ensued after the deposition of the Amorite vassal king of Assyria [[Asinum]], who was a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I, by a native Akkadian vice regent named [[Puzur-Sin]]. A native Akkadian king [[Ashur-dugul]] seized the throne, and a period of civil war ensued with five further kings ([[Ashur-apla-idi]], [[Nasir-Sin]], [[Sin-namir]], [[Ipqi-Ishtar]] and [[Adad-salulu]]) all reigning in quick succession. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene. Finally, a native Akkadian king named [[Adasi]] came to the fore circa 1720 BC and completely freed Assyria from the pretence of Babylonian dominance. This also brought to an end the Amorite presence in Assyria, although they were to remain in power in Babylon until 1595 BC. Adasi drove the [[Babylonians]] and [[Amorites]] from northern Mesopotamia during the late 18th century BC and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole.

Adasi was succeeded by [[Bel-bani]] (1700-1691 BC). Little is known of many of the kings that followed such as; [[Libaya]] (1690-1674 BC), [[Sharma-Adad I]] (1673-1662 BC), [[Iptar-Sin]] (1661-1650 BC), [[Bazaya]] (1649-1622 BC), [[Lullaya]] (1621-1618 BC), [[Shu-Ninua]] (1615-1602 BC), [[Sharma-Adad II]] (1601-1599 BC), [[Erishum III]] (1598-1586 BC), and [[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585-1580 BC). However Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the [[Hittites]], [[Hurrians]], [[Amorites]], [[Babylonians]] or [[Mitanni]] for well over 200 years. When Babylon fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, they were unable to make inroads into Assyria and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]] and [[Erishum III]] of Assyria. Similarly, [[Adad-nirari I]] (1547-1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded [[Mitanni]] kingdom, the [[Hittite]] empire or Babylon. [[Puzur-Ashur III]] (1521-1498 BC) of Assyria and [[Burna-Buriash I]] the Kassite king of Babylon, signed a treaty defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th nation century BC. [[Puzur-Ashur III]], undertook much rebuilding work in [[Assur]], the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defenses. Temples to the moon god [[Sin]] ([[Nanna]]) and the sun god [[Shamash]] were erected in the 15th century BC.

===Assyria under Mitanni domination===
The emergence of the [[Mitanni]] Empire in the 16th century BC eventually led to a period of [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the 15th Century. Some time after the death of [[Puzur-Ashur III]] in 1498 BC, [[Saushtatar]], king of [[Hanilgalbat]] (Hurrians of [[Mitanni]]), sacked Ashur and made Assyria a largely vassal state. This event is most likely to have happened during the reign of [[Enlil-nasir I]] or his successor [[Nur-ili]]. The Mitanni appear not to have interfered in Assyrian internal affairs, for example the son of Nur-ili, [[Ashur-shaduni]] was deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi I]] and [[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] was deposed by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] in 1420 BC. Assyrian kings seemed to have been free of this dominance regarding international affairs at times also, as evidenced by the treaty between [[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] and [[Kariandash]] of Babylon in the late 15th century.  By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392 BC - 1366 BC) Mitanni influence was on the wane.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the [[chronology of Babylonia and Assyria]] for the early second millennium (i.e., the &quot;high&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; chronologies.)

==Middle Assyrian period - Assyrian resurgence==
[[Image:Amarnamap.png|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Ancient Near East]] during the [[Amarna Period]], showing the great powers of the day: Egypt (green), [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] (yellow), the [[Kassites|Kassite]] kingdom of Babylon (purple), Assyria (grey), and Mitanni (red). Lighter areas show direct control, darker areas represent spheres of influence. The extent of the [[Achaean]]/[[Mycenaean]] civilization is shown in orange.]]

Scholars variously date the beginning of the &quot;Middle Assyrian period&quot; to either the fall of the Old Assyrian kingdom of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], or to the ascension of [[Ashur-uballit I]] to the throne of Assyria.

===Assyrian expansion and empire===

{{See also|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
Assyria paid tribute to Hanilgalbat until Mitanni power collapsed from Assyrian pressure from the east and [[Hittites|Hittite]] pressure from the north-west, enabling [[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1330 BC) to completely throw off Mitanni domination and again make Assyria a fully independent and imperial power at the expense of [[Kassite]] [[Babylonia]], the [[Mitanni]], [[Hurrians]] and the [[Hittites]]; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to [[Akhenaten]] of [[Egypt]] form part of the [[Amarna letters]]. This marriage led to disastrous results, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit promptly marched into Babylonia and avenged his son-in-law, deposing the king and installing [[Kurigalzu]] of the royal line king there.
Ashur-uballit I defeated [[Mattiwaza]] the Mitanni king despite attempts by the [[Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliumas]] attempting to preserve his throne with military support. The lands of the Mitanni were duly appropriated by Assyria, making it a large and powerful state.

[[Enlil-nirari]] succeeded Ashur-uballit I. He described himself as a &quot;Great-King&quot; (''Sharru rabû'') in letters to the [[Hittite]] kings. He was immediately attacked by [[Kurigalzu]] of Babylon, but succeeded in defeating him and repelling Babylonian attempts to invade Assyria, appropriating Babylonian territory in the process. The successor of Enlil-nirari, [[Arik-den-ili]] (c. 1307-1296 BC), consolidated Assyrian power, and successfully campaigned in the [[Zagros]] Mountains against the [[Lullubi]] and [[Gutians]]. He was followed by [[Adad-nirari I]] who made [[Kalhu]] (Biblical [[Calah]]) his capital, and continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]], conquering Hittite territories such as [[Carchemish]] and beyond. Adad-nirari I made gains to the south, forcing the [[Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] into accepting a new frontier agreement in Assyria's favour.

In 1274 BC [[Shalmaneser I]] ascended the throne. He proved to be a great warrior king. During his reign he conquered the powerful kingdom of [[Urartu]] in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the fierce [[Gutians]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. He then attacked the [[Hurrians]], defeating both King [[Shattuara]] and his [[Hittite]] and [[Aramean]] allies, and finally destroying the Hurrian kingdom in the process. Assyria was now a major threat to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers made peace with one another.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244 BC -1208 BC), conquered [[Babylonia]], deposing [[Kashtiliash IV]] and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; first used by [[Sargon of Akkad]]. In the process he defeated the [[Elamites]], who had themselves coveted Babylon. However, Tukulti-Ninurta I was murdered by his own sons in a palace revolt and was succeeded by [[Ashur-nadin-apli]]. Another unstable period for Assyria followed, it was riven by periods of internal strife and the new king only made token and unsuccessful attempts to recapture Babylon, whose Kassite kings had taken advantage of this and freed themselves from Assyrian rule. However, Assyria appears to have stabilised by the reign of [[Ashur-Dan I]] who ruled for an unusually long period of 46 years, from 1179 BC to 1133 BC.

As the Hittite empire collapsed from the onslaught of the [[Phrygians]] (called [[Mushki]] in Assyrian annals), Babylon and Assyria began to vie for [[Amorite]] regions (in modern [[Syria]]), formerly under firm [[Hittite]] control. When their forces encountered one another in this region, the Assyrian king [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] met and defeated [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of Babylon. Assyria then invaded and annexed Hittite controlled lands.

[[Tiglath-Pileser I]], vies with [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ashur-uballit I]] among historians as being regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. The son of [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]], he ascended to the throne in 1115 BC, and became one of the greatest of Assyrian conquerors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;&gt;The encyclopædia britannica:a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968&lt;/ref&gt;

His first campaign in 1112 BC was against the [[Phrygians]] who had occupied certain Assyrian districts in the Upper [[Euphrates]]; he then overran the [[Luwian]] kingdoms of [[Commagene]], [[Cilicia]] and [[Cappadocia]], and drove the Hittites from the Assyrian province of [[Subartu]], northeast of [[Malatia]].

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated [[Urartu]], into the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] and then turned westward to receive the submission of Malatia. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser attacked [[Commagene]] and [[Cilicia]] in [[Cappadocia]], and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his [[Cilicia]]n conquests.

The [[Aramaeans]] of northern Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt; The control of the high road to the [[Mediterranean]] was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pethor]] at the junction between the [[Euphrates]] and [[Sajur]]; thence he proceeded to conquer the [[Canaanite]]/[[Phoenician]] cities of ([[Byblos]]), [[Sidon]], and finally [[Arvad]] where he embarked onto a ship to sail the [[Mediterranean]], on which he killed a ''nahiru'' or &quot;sea-horse&quot; (which [[A. Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt; He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Hadad]] at the Assyrian capital of  [[Assur]] ([[Ashur]]) was one of his initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt;
He also invaded and defeated [[Babylon]] twice, assuming the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, forcing tribute from Babylon, although he was unable to actually depose the actual king in Babylonia, where the old ''Kassite Dynasty'' had now succumbed to an [[Elamite]] one.

===Assyria in the Ancient Dark Ages===
After [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] in 1076 BC, Assyria was in ''comparative'' decline for the next 150 years. The period from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people. Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Phrygia]], [[Urartu]], [[Persia]] and [[Median Empire|Media]]&lt;ref&gt;According to George Roux p282-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time. This long period of isolation ended with the accession in 911 BC of [[Adad-nirari II]]. He firmly subjugated the areas previously under only nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome [[Aramean]], neo [[Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adadinirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala]] river and the towns of [[Hit]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid [[Mesopotamia]]. He made further gains over [[Babylonia]] under [[Nabu-shuma-ukin]] later in his reign. He was succeeded by [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] in 891 BC, an energetic ruler who further consolidated Assyria's position and expanded northwards and eastwards into [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Zagros Mountains]] during his short reign.

===Society in the Middle Assyrian period===
Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade was effectively dominated by the [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], Kalhu ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley. At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population ca. 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city of that time.&lt;ref&gt;see [[historical urban community sizes]]. Estimates are those of Chandler (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. The [[Assyrian law]] code, notable for its repressive attitude towards women in their society, was compiled during this period.

==Neo-Assyrian Empire==
[[Image:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its expansions.]]
{{main|Neo-Assyrian Empire|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in [[911 BC]], lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in [[612 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=AE_Chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires&amp;nbsp;— All Empires]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Assyrian period, Assyria had at times been a strong kingdom and imperial power based in northern [[Mesopotamia]], competing for dominance with [[Babylonia]] to the south and with the [[Hittites]] and [[Arameans]] to the west, the [[Hittite]] empire and the [[Phrygians]] to the north, and the [[Elamites]] to the east. 
Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] (911-882 BC), Assyria once more became a great power, growing to be the greatest empire the world had yet seen. Adad-nirari II expanded Assyrian territory to include all of northern Mesopotamia, north eastern [[Aramea]], parts of south eastern [[Asia Minor]] (at the expense of the [[Arameans]] and neo [[Hittites]]) and annexing swathes of [[Babylonian]] territory. 

His successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (891-884 BC) consolidated Assyria's gains and expanded into the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], subjugating the newly arrived [[Persians]] and [[Medes]] as well as pushing into central [[Asia Minor]]. [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC) was a fierce and ruthless ruler who advanced without opposition through [[Aram]] (modern [[Syria]]) and [[Asia Minor]] as far as the [[Mediterranean]] and conquered and exacted tribute from [[Aramea]], [[Phrygia]] and [[Phoenicia]]. Ashurnasirpal II also repressed revolts among the [[Medes]] and [[Persians]] in the Zagros Mountains, and moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth, science and art. 

[[Shalmaneser III]] (858–823 BC) attacked and reduced [[Babylonia]] to vassalage, and defeated [[Aramea]], [[Israel]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]] and the neo [[Hittite]] states, forcing all of these to pay tribute to Assyria. 
[[Shamshi-Adad V]] (822-811 BC) inherited an empire beset by civil war which he took most of his reign to quell. 
He was succeeded by [[Adad-nirari III]] who was merely a boy. The Empire was thus ruled by the famed queen [[Semiramis]] until 806 BC. In that year Adad-nirari III took the reins of power. He invaded the Levant and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], neo [[Hittites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persians]], [[Medes]] and [[Manneans]], penetrating as far as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He forced [[Babylonia]] to pay tribute. His next targets were the [[Chaldean]] and [[Sutu]] tribes of south eastern Mesopotamia who he conquered and reduced to vassalage, and the [[Arabs]] were forced to pay tribute.
After his premature death, Assyria failed to expand further during the reigns of [[Shalmaneser IV]] (782-773 BC), [[Ashur-dan III]] (772-755 BC) and [[Ashur-nirari V]] (754-746 BC). 

[[Tiglath-Pileser II]] (745-727 BC) initiated a renewed period of Assyrian expansion; [[Urartu]], [[Persia]], [[Media]], [[Mannea]], [[Babylonia]], [[Arabia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Israel]], [[Judah]], [[Samaria]], [[Palestine]], [[Nabatea]], [[Chaldea]] and the [[Neo-Hittites]] were subjugated, Tiglath-Pileser II was declared king in [[Babylon]] and the Assyrian empire was now stretched from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Cyprus]]. 
[[Shalmaneser V]] (726-723 BC) consolidated Assyrian power during his short reign, and repressed [[Egyptian]] attempts to gain a foothold in the near east. 

[[Sargon II]] (722-705 BC) maintained the empire, driving the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] from Iran, where they had invaded and attacked the [[Persians]] who were vassals of Assyria. [[Mannea]], [[Cilicia]] [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] were conquered, [[Urartu]] was ravaged, and [[Babylon]], [[Aram]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Israel]], [[Arabia]], [[Phrygia]] and [[Cyprus]] paid tribute. 

[[Sennacherib]] (705-681 BC) defeated the [[Greeks]] who were attempting to gain a foothold in [[Cilicia]], and defeated and drove the [[Egyptians]] from [[Israel]] and [[Phoenicia]] where they had fermented revolt against Assyria. [[Babylon]] revolted, and Sennacherib laid waste to the city, defeating its [[Elamite]] and [[Chaldean]] allies in the process. 
[[Esarhaddon]] expanded Assyria still further, campaigning deep into the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north, and invading and conquering [[Egypt]] in the south, driving its foreign [[Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopian]] rulers out in the process. He expanded the empire as far south as [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]] or [[Qatar]]). Esarhaddon rebuilt Babylon during his reign, bringing peace to Mesopotamia as a whole. The [[Elamites]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Urartu]] were vanquished and Assyria's empire was kept secure. 

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669-627 BC) its domination spanned from from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] in the east. Ashurbanipal destroyed [[Elam]] and smashed a rebellion led by his own brother [[Shamash-shum-ukim]] who was the Assyrian king of [[Babylon]], exacting savage revenge on the [[Chaldeans]], [[Nabateans]], [[Arabs]] and [[Elamites]] who had supported him. [[Persia]] and [[Media]] were regarded as vassals of Ashurbanipal. He built vast libraries and initiated a surge in the building of temples and palaces.  

At its height Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (and expelled its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu|Ararat]] ([[Armenians|Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Hurrians]], northern [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from  [[Scythia]], [[Crimea|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.

==Downfall, 626-605 BC==
Assyria was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC &amp;mdash; the nation descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]].

Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed after four years of bitter fighting by Sin-shumu-lishir, an Assyrian general who had also claimed Babylon briefly. In turn, Sin-shumu-lishir was deposed after a year of warfare by Sin-shar-ishkun &amp;mdash; who was then himself faced with constant rebellion in the Assyrian homeland, coupled with wholesale revolution in Babylon and aggression from former Assyrian colonies to the east and north. Many of Assyria's vassal states and colonies took advantage of this situation to free themselves from Assyrian rule.

By 620 BC, [[Nabopolassar]], a member of the [[Chaldean]] tribe from the far southeast of Mesopotamia, had claimed Babylonia. Sin-shar-ishkun was unable to reconquer Babylonia, being hampered by rebellion in Assyria; similarly, Nabopolassar was unable to make inroads into Assyria, being repelled at every attempt. However, Nabopolassar entered into an alliance with the Median king [[Cyaxares]], who had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to free his people from Assyrian vassalage and unite the Iranic Medes and Persians, and the remnants of the [[Elamites]] and [[Manneans]], into a powerful Median-dominated force. The Babylonians and Medes, together with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], attacked Assyria in 616 BC. After bitter fighting, [[Nineveh]] was finally sacked in 612 BC, after a prolonged siege, Sin-shar-ishkun was killed in the process. The last known Assyrian king, [[Ashur-uballit II]], held out at [[Harran]] from 612 BC until 609 BC, but was overrun by the Babylonians and Medes. Final resistance seems to have ended in 605 BC, with the defeat of an Assyrian-Egyptian relief force at [[Carchemish]]. It is not known whether Ashur-uballit II perished at Harran, Carchemish, or simply disappeared.

==Assyria after the Empire==

Assyria was ruled by [[Babylon]] from 605 BC until 539 BC, and in a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]], however apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in that city, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and it is not certain if [[Assur]] and [[Arbela]] were completely destroyed. However, although the [[Biblical]] accounts of Assyria's total distruction were far fetched, Assyria spent much of this period in a state of devastation following its fall.
After this, it was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 539 BC to 330 BC. Assyria seems to have recovered somewhat, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html mainstay of the Persian Army]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Assyria even became powerful enough to raise a full scale revolt against the empire in 520 BC. The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination, and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux-Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;
In 330 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]] and became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] and was renamed [[Syria]], a Hurrian, Luwian and Greek corruption of '''Assyria'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this period that the later ''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises, the Seleucids applied the name to Assyria itself but also to the lands to the west which had been part of the Assyrian empire. When they lost control of Assyria itself, the name ''Syria'' survived and was applied to the land of [[Aramea]] to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire.
By 150 BC, it was under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]] as [[Athura]] where the Assyrian city of [[Ashur]] seems to have gained a degree of autonomy, and temples to the native gods of Assyria were resurrected. A number of neo-Assyrian states arose, namely [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]].
In 116 AD, under [[Trajan]], it was taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]. The Assyrians began to convert to [[Christianity]] from [[Ashurism]] during the period between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Parthians]] fought over Assyria and the rest of Mesopotamia until 226 AD, when it was taken over by the [[Sassanid]] (Persian) Empire. 
It was known as [[Asuristan]] during this period, and became a main centre of the [[Church of the East]] (now the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]), with a flourishing [[Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] in his home city and in Harran during the 4th century AD, indicating an Assyrian identity was still strong. After the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th Century AD Assyria was dissolved as an entity. Under Arab rule Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a process of ''Arabisation'' and ''Islamification'', and the region saw a large influx of non indigenous [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], and later [[Turkic]] peoples. However a percentage of the indigenous Assyrian population resisted this process, [[Assyrian]] [[Aramaic]] language and [[Church of the East]] [[Christianity]] were still dominant in the north, as late as the 11th and 12th centuries AD&lt;ref&gt;According to George Roux and Simo Parpola&lt;/ref&gt;. The 14th century AD massacres by [[Tamurlane]] massively reduced the population, however they exist to this day as the modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (aka [[Chaldo-Assyrian]] [[Christians]]), who still retain Mesopotamian ethnicity, heritage, identity, names and Mesopotamian [[Aramaic]] dialects as mother tongues. An [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]] following the [[Assyrian Genocide]] suffered at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish]] allies. Further persecutions have occurred since, such as the [[Simele Massacre]], [[al Anfal]] campaign and [[Baathist]] and [[Islamist]] persecutions.

==Language==
During the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BC]], there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=9780199532223|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt;

[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of [[Mesopotamia]] somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;Woods C. 2006 “Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian”. In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91-120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In ancient times Assyrians spoke a dialect of the [[Akkadian language]], an eastern branch of the [[Semitic languages]]. The first inscriptions, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period. In the Neo-Assyrian period the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common, more so than [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]&amp;nbsp;— this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings, in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians. The ancient Assyrians also used the [[Sumerian language]] in their literature and liturgy, although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies ensured that much of the bilingual elite were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used Eastern Aramaic and not Akkadian. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st Century AD. However Eastern Aramaic dialects still survive to this day among Assyrians in the regions of northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and northeast Syria that constituted old Assyria.

==Arts and sciences==
{{main|Art of Mesopotamia|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}
[[Image:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull ''Lamassu'', or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that ''lamassi'' were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Since works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, we are lucky to have some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry. These were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.&lt;ref name = &quot;Muſeum&quot;&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1  Lens], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

==Legacy and rediscovery==
{{main|Assyria (Persian province)|Assyriology|Assyrianism}}
Achaemenid Assyria (539 BC - 330 BC) retained a separate identity ([[Athura]]), official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of  Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under [[Seleucid]] rule (330 BC&amp;nbsp;— Approx 150 BC), however, [[Aramaic]] gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the [[Arab]] period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD Assyria changed hands between the Parthians and Romans [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]] until coming under the rule of Sassanid Persia in 226 AD - 651 AD, where it was known as [[Asuristan]].

A number of at least partly neo Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Classical authorities on Babylonia and Assyria|Classical historiographers]] had only retained a very dim picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in  [[Ptolemy's Canon]], beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

The [[modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of [[cuneiform]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade, but by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the  formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia.
In the wake of the archaeological and philological [[rediscovery of ancient Assyria]], [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] people, and has come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.

'''Abijah''' or '''Abiah''' or '''Abia''' is a Biblical [[unisex name]] meaning '''Aviya''' or &quot;my Father is [[Yahu|Yahweh]]&quot; in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfnames.com/mfnames/a/origin-and-meaning-of-abijah.htm MFnames.com - Origin and Meaning of Abijah]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament the name Abijah was borne by several characters:

'''Women'''
# [[Abijah (queen)]], the daughter of [[Zechariah]] (2 Chr. 29:1; compare [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8:2), who married King [[Ahaz]] of Judah. She is also called Abi. (2 Kings 18:2) She was the mother of King [[Hezekiah]]. ([[BibleWiki:2 Chronicles Chapter 29, Verse 1|2 Chr. 29:1]])
# A wife of [[Hetzron]], one of the grandchildren of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]]. (1 Chr. 2:24)

'''Men'''
# [[Abijah (king)]] of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], also known as [[Abijam]], who was son of [[Rehoboam]] and succeeded him on the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. (1 Chr. 3:10, [[BibleWiki:Matthew Chapter 1, Verse 7|Matt. 1:7]], 1 Kings 14:31)
# A son of [[Becher]], the son of [[Benjamin]]. (1 Chr. 7:8)
# The second son of [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]]. ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28) His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in [[Beer-sheba]], to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a [[monarchy]]
# A descendant of [[Eleazar]], the son of [[Aaron]], a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by [[David (biblical king)|David]] (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah was one of those which did not return from the Captivity. ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:36-39; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 7:39-42; 12:1)
# A son of [[Jeroboam]], the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found &quot;some good thing toward the Lord,&quot; he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and &quot;all Israel mourned for him.&quot; ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:1-18)
#The head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which [[David]] divided the priests, and an ancestor of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zecharias]] the priest, who was the father of [[John the Baptist]]. ({{bibleref|1Chronicles|24:10|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:5|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:13|KJV}})

'''Aphasia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|f|eɪ|ʒ|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|eɪ|z|i|ə}}) is an impairment of language ability. This class of [[language disorder]] ranges from having difficulty remembering words to being completely unable to speak, read, or write.

Aphasia disorders usually develop quickly as a result of [[head injury]] or [[stroke]], but can develop slowly from a [[brain tumor]], [[infection]], or [[dementia]], or can be a learning disability such as [[dysnomia]]. &lt;ref name = &quot;medicinenet.com&quot; &gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/aphasia/article.htm | title = Aphasia | accessdate = 2011-05-23 | work = MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area and extent of brain damage determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms. Aphasia types include [[Broca's aphasia]], [[non-fluent aphasia]], [[motor aphasia]], [[expressive aphasia]], [[receptive aphasia]], [[global aphasia]] and many others (see [[:Category:Aphasias]]).  

Medical evaluations for the disorder range from clinical screenings by a [[neurologist]] to extensive tests by a [[Speech and language pathology|language pathologist]]. &lt;ref name = &quot;medicinenet.com&quot; /&gt;

Most aphasia patients can recover some or most skills by working with a speech and language therapist. This rehabilitation can take two or more years and is most effective when begun quickly. Only a small minority will recover without therapy, such as those suffering a [[transient ischemic attack|mini-stroke]]. Patients with a learning-disorder aphasia such as dysnomia can learn coping skills, but cannot recover abilities that are [[Congenital disorder|congenitally limited]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo&quot;&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/aphasia/DS00685/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs | title = Aphasia: Treatments and drugs | accessdate = 2011-05-23 | first = Mayo Clinc Staff | publisher = Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the patient's age, health, motivation, [[handedness]], and educational level. &lt;ref name = &quot;medicinenet.com&quot; /&gt;

==Classification ==
Classifying the different subtypes of aphasia is difficult and has led to disagreements among experts. The localizationist model is the original model, but modern anatomical techniques and analyses have shown that precise connections between brain regions and symptom classification don't exist. The neural organization of language is complicated; language is a comprehensive and complex behavior and it makes sense that it isn't the product of some small, circumscribed region of the brain.

No classification of patients in subtypes and groups of subtypes is adequate. Only about 60% of patients will fit in a classification scheme such as fluent/nonfluent/pure aphasias. There is a huge variation among patients with the same diagnosis, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, patients with naming deficits (anomic aphasia) might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kolb, Bryan; Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth |location=[New York] |year=2003 |pages= 502, 505, 511|isbn=0-7167-5300-6 |oclc=464808209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localizationist model===
[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|Cortex]]
The localizationist model attempts to classify the aphasia by major characteristics and then link these to areas of the brain in which the damage has been caused. The initial two categories here were devised by early neurologists working in the field, namely [[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]]. Other researchers have added to the model, resulting in it often being referred to as the &quot;Boston-Neoclassical Model&quot;. The most prominent writers on this topic have been [[Harold Goodglass]] and [[Edith Kaplan]].

* Individuals with [[Broca's aphasia]] (also termed [[expressive aphasia]]) were once thought to have ventral temporal damage, though more recent work by Dr. Nina Dronkers using imaging and 'lesion analysis' has revealed that patients with Broca's aphasia have lesions to the medial insular cortex. Broca missed these lesions because his studies did not dissect the brains of diseased patients, so only the more temporal damage was visible. Dronkers and Dr. Odile Plaisant scanned Broca's original patients' brains using a non-invasive MRI scanner to take a closer look. Individuals with Broca's aphasia often have [[hemiplegia|right-sided weakness]] or paralysis of the arm and leg, because the frontal lobe is also important for body movement. Video clips showing patients with Broca-type aphasia [https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal/?q=brocas_aphasia can be found here.]

* In contrast to Broca's aphasia, damage to the [[temporal lobe]] may result in a fluent aphasia that is called [[Wernicke's aphasia]] (also termed [[sensory aphasia]]). These individuals usually have no body weakness, because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement. A video clip with a patient exhibiting Wernicke's aphasia [https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal/?q=wernicke_aphasia can be found here]

* Working from Wernicke's model of aphasia, [[Ludwig Lichtheim]] proposed five other types of aphasia, but these were not tested against real patients until modern imaging made more in-depth studies available. The other five types of aphasia in the localizationist model are:

#[[Pure word deafness]]
#[[Conduction aphasia]]
#[[Apraxia of speech]] (now considered a separate disorder in itself)
#[[Transcortical motor aphasia]]
#[[Transcortical sensory aphasia]]

* [[Anomia]] is another type of aphasia proposed under what is commonly known as the Boston-Neoclassical model, which is essentially a difficulty with naming. A final type of aphasia, [[global aphasia]], results from damage to extensive portions of the perisylvian region of the brain. An individual with [[global aphasia]] will have difficulty understanding both spoken and written language and will also have difficulty speaking. This is a severe type of aphasia which makes it quite difficult when communicating with the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Sarno, M. (2007). Neurogenic disorders of speech and language. In: O’Sullivan, S.B. &amp; Schmitz, T.J. (2007). Physical Rehabilitation (5th ed.). Philadelphia (PA): F.A. Davis Company. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ways to classify aphasia===
Aphasia can also be classified as

# Receptive
# Intermediate
# Expressive

Receptive aphasias can be subdivided into

A - pure word deafness (patient can hear but not understand words) &lt;br /&gt; 
B - alexia (patient can read but not understand words) &lt;br /&gt; 
C - visual asymbolia (written words are disorganized and can not be recognized).

Intermediate - also called nominal amnestic aphasia.

Expressive aphasia also known as Broca's aphasia or cortical motor aphasia (patient has difficulty in putting his thoughts into words)

===Fluent, non-fluent and &quot;pure&quot; aphasias===
The different types of aphasia can be divided into three categories: fluent, non-fluent and &quot;pure&quot; aphasias.&lt;ref name=KolbWhishaw1&gt;{{cite book |author=Kolb, Bryan; Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth |location=[New York] |year=2003 |pages= 502–504 |isbn=0-7167-5300-6 |oclc=464808209 }}&lt;!-- The whole paragraph &quot;fluent, non-fluent and pure aphasias&quot; is written with help of this reference.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fluent aphasias''', also called '''receptive aphasias''', are impairments related mostly to the input or reception of language, with difficulties either in auditory verbal comprehension or in the repetition of words, phrases, or sentences spoken by others. Speech is easy and fluent, but there are difficulties related to the output of language as well, such as [[paraphasia]]. Examples of fluent aphasias are: [[Wernicke's aphasia]], [[Transcortical sensory aphasia]], [[Conduction aphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia]]&lt;ref name=KolbWhishaw1/&gt;

* '''Nonfluent aphasias''', also called '''expressive aphasias''' are difficulties in articulating, but in most cases there is relatively good auditory verbal comprehension. Examples of nonfluent aphasias are: [[Broca's aphasia]], [[Transcortical motor aphasia]], [[Global aphasia]]&lt;ref name=KolbWhishaw1/&gt;

* '''&quot;Pure&quot; aphasias''' are selective impairments in reading, writing, or the recognition of words. These disorders may be quite selective. For example, a person is able to read but not write, or is able to write but not read. Examples of pure aphasias are: [[Pure alexia]], [[Agraphia]], [[Pure word deafness]]&lt;ref name=KolbWhishaw1/&gt;

===Primary and secondary aphasia===
Aphasia can be divided into primary and secondary aphasia.

* ''Primary aphasia'' is due to problems with language-processing mechanisms.
* ''Secondary aphasia'' is the result of other problems, like memory impairments, attention disorders, or perceptual problems.

===Cognitive neuropsychological model===
The cognitive neuropsychological model builds on [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. It assumes that language processing can be broken down into a number of modules, each of which has a specific function. Hence there is a module which recognises [[phonemes]] as they are spoken and a module which stores formulated phonemes before they are spoken. Use of this model clinically involves conducting a battery of assessments (usually from the PALPA, the &quot;psycholinguistic assessment of language processing in adult acquired aphasia ... that can be tailored to the investigation of an individual patient's impaired and intact abilities&quot; http://www.psypress.com/palpa-9780863771668, last visited 1/21/2011), each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to where the impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat the individual module.

===Acquired childhood aphasia===
'''Acquired childhood aphasia''' (ACA) is a language impairment resulting from some kind of brain damage. This brain damage can have different causes, such as [[head trauma]], [[tumors]], [[cerebrovascular]] accidents, or [[seizure disorders]]. Most, but not all authors state that ACA is preceded by a period of normal language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Murdoch, B. E. |title=Acquired neurological speech/language disorders in childhood |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Washington, DC |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-85066-490-X |oclc=21976166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Age of onset]] is usually defined as from [[infancy]] until but not including [[adolescence]].

ACA should be distinguished from [[developmental aphasia]] or [[developmental dysphasia]], which is a primary delay or failure in [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Woods&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Woods | first1 = Bryan T. | title = Handbook of neurological speech and language disorders | chapter = Acquired childhood aphasia | editors = Kirshner, Howard S. | publisher = M. Dekker | year = 1995 | location = New York | accessdate = 2010-07-12 | isbn = 0-8247-9282-3 |oclc= 	31075598}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important difference between ACA and developmental childhood aphasia is that in the latter there is no apparent [[neurological]] basis for the language deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paquier | first1 = P.F. | authorlink1 = H.R. | last2 = van Dongen | title = Aphasia in atypical populations | chapter = Is Acquired Childhood Aphasia Atypical? | editors = Basso, Anna; Coppens, Patrick; Lebrun, Yvan | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | year = 1998 | location = Hillsdale, N.J | isbn = 0-8058-1738-7 |oclc= 37712996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACA is one of the more rare language problems in children and is notable because of its contribution to theories on language and the brain.&lt;ref name = &quot;Woods&quot; /&gt; Because there are so few children with ACA, not much is known about what types of linguistic problems these children have. However, many authors report a marked decrease in the use of all [[expressive language]]. Children can just stop talking for a period of weeks or even years, and when they start to talk again, they need a lot of encouragement. Problems with [[language comprehension]] are less common in ACA, and don't last as long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Baker, Lorian; Cantwell, Dennis P. |title=Developmental speech and language disorders |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=0-89862-400-2 |oclc=14520470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia.

* inability to [[language comprehension|comprehend language]]
* inability to [[pronounce]], not due to muscle paralysis or weakness
* inability to speak spontaneously
* inability to form words
* inability to name objects
* poor [[enunciation]]
* excessive creation and use of personal [[neologism]]s
* inability to repeat a phrase
* persistent repetition of phrases
* [[paraphasia]] (substituting letters, syllables or words)
* [[agrammatism]] (inability to speak in a grammatically correct fashion)
* [[dysprosody]] (alterations in inflexion, stress, and rhythm)
* uncompleted sentences
* inability to [[Reading (process)|read]]
* inability to [[writing|write]]
* limited verbal output
* difficulty in naming

The following table summarizes some major characteristics of different types of aphasia:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; class=&quot;sortable wikitable&quot;
! align=left | Type of aphasia
! align=left | [[Speech repetition|Repetition]]
! align=left | Naming
! align=left | Auditory comprehension
! align=left | Fluency
! align=left | Presentation
|-
| [[Wernicke's aphasia]]
| mild–mod || mild–severe ||defective || fluent paraphasic || Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new &quot;words&quot; ([[neologism]]s). For example, someone with Wernicke's aphasia may say, &quot;You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before&quot;, meaning &quot;The dog needs to go out so I will take him for a walk&quot;. They have poor auditory and reading comprehension, and fluent, but nonsensical, oral and written expression. Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding the speech of both themselves and others and are therefore often unaware of their mistakes.
|-
| [[Transcortical sensory aphasia]]
| good || mod–severe || poor || fluent || Similar deficits as in Wernicke's aphasia, but repetition ability remains intact.
|-
| [[Conduction aphasia]]
| poor || poor || relatively good || fluent || Conduction aphasia is caused by deficits in the connections between the speech-comprehension and speech-production areas. This might be caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, the structure that transmits information between Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Similar symptoms, however, can be present after damage to the [[insular cortex|insula]] or to the [[auditory cortex]]. Auditory comprehension is near normal, and oral expression is fluent with occasional paraphasic errors. Repetition ability is poor.
|-
| [[Nominal aphasia|Nominal or Anomic aphasia]]
| mild || mod–severe || mild || fluent || Anomic aphasia is essentially a difficulty with naming. The patient may have difficulties naming certain words, linked by their grammatical type (e.g. difficulty naming verbs and not nouns) or by their [[semantic]] category (e.g. difficulty naming words relating to photography but nothing else) or a more general naming difficulty. Patients tend to produce grammatic, yet empty, speech. Auditory comprehension tends to be preserved.
|-
| [[Broca's aphasia]]
| mod–severe || mod–severe || mild difficulty || non-fluent, effortful, slow || Individuals with Broca's aphasia frequently speak short, meaningful phrases that are produced with great effort. Broca's aphasia is thus characterized as a nonfluent aphasia. Affected people often omit small words such as &quot;is&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, and &quot;the&quot;. For example, a person with Broca's aphasia may say, &quot;Walk dog&quot; which could mean &quot;I will take the dog for a walk&quot;, &quot;You take the dog for a walk&quot; or even &quot;The dog walked out of the yard&quot;. Individuals with Broca's aphasia are able to understand the speech of others to varying degrees. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated by their speaking problems. It is associated with right [[hemiparesis]], meaning that there can be paralysis of the patient's right face and arm.
|-
| [[Transcortical motor aphasia]]
| good || mild–severe || mild || non-fluent || Similar deficits as Broca's aphasia, except repetition ability remains intact. Auditory comprehension is generally fine for simple conversations, but declines rapidly for more complex conversations. It is associated with right hemiparesis, meaning that there can be paralysis of the patient's right face and arm.
|-
| [[Global aphasia]]
| poor || poor || poor || non-fluent || Individuals with global aphasia have severe communication difficulties and will be extremely limited in their ability to speak or comprehend language.  They may be totally nonverbal, and/or only use facial expressions and gestures to communicate. It is associated with right hemiparesis, meaning that there can be paralysis of the patient's right face and arm.
|-
| [[Mixed transcortical aphasia]]
| moderate || poor || poor || non-fluent || Similar deficits as in global aphasia, but repetition ability remains intact.
|-
| [[Subcortical aphasias]]
|          ||      ||      ||            || Characteristics and symptoms depend upon the site and size of subcortical lesion. Possible sites of lesions include the [[thalamus]], internal capsule, and basal ganglia.

Jargon aphasia is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which the [[patient|patient's]] [[Speech communication|speech]] is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact [[syntax]] and [[grammar]], but the patient has problems with the selection of [[noun]]s. They will either replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one, or has some other connection, or they will replace it with [[sound]]s. Accordingly, patients with jargon aphasia often use [[neologism]]s, and may [[perseveration|perseverate]] if they try to replace the words they can't find with sounds.

Commonly, substitutions involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g. clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g. letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g. lane - late).

==Causes==
Aphasia usually results from [[lesion]]s to the language-relevant areas of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes of the brain, such as [[Broca's area]], [[Wernicke's area]], and the neural pathways between them. These areas are almost always located in the [[left hemisphere]], and in most people this is where the ability to produce and comprehend language is found. However, in a very small number of people, language ability is found in the right hemisphere. In either case, damage to these language areas can be caused by a [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], or other [[Brain damage|brain injury]]. Aphasia may also develop slowly, as in the case of a [[brain tumor]] or progressive [[neurological disease]], e.g., [[Alzheimer's]] or [[Parkinson's]] disease. It may also be caused by a sudden [[hemorrhagic]] event within the brain. Certain chronic neurological disorders, such as [[epilepsy]] or [[migraine]], can also include transient aphasia as a [[prodromal]] or episodic symptom.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Aphasia is also listed as a rare side effect of the [[fentanyl]] patch, an opioid used to control chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/fentanyl-transdermal.html#A02A9CB6-35CF-4F01-A980-C3733E0F861A |title=Fentanyl Transdermal Official FDA information, side effects and uses. |format= |work=Drug Information Online |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias.  The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections.  Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual.  Studies have shown that although there isn't consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment in general has positive outcomes&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Sullivan&quot;&gt;O’Sullivan, S. B., &amp; Schmitz, T. J. (2007). Physical rehabilitation. (5th ed.). Philadelphia (PA): F. A. Davis Company.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A multi-disciplinary team, including the doctor, psychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, and social worker, works together in treating aphasia.  For the most part, treatment relies heavily on repetition and aims to address language performance by working on task-specific skills.  The primary goal is to help the individual and those closest to them adjust to changes and limitations in communication&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Sullivan&quot;/&gt;.

Treatment techniques mostly fall under two approaches:
#Substitute Skill Model - an approach that uses an aid to help with spoken language, i.e. a writing board
#Direct Treatment Model - an approach which targets deficits with specific exercises&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Sullivan&quot;/&gt;

Several treatment techniques include the following:
*Visual Communication Therapy (VIC) - the use of index cards with symbols to represent various components of speech
*Visual Action Therapy (VAT) - involves training individuals to assign specific gestures for certain objects
*Functional Communication Treatment (FCT) - focuses on improving activities specific to functional tasks, social interaction, and self-expression
*Promoting Aphasic's Communicative Effectiveness (PACE) - a means of encouraging normal interaction between patients and clinicians.
*Other - i.e. drawing as a way of communicating, trained conversation partners&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Sullivan&quot;/&gt;

More recently, computer technology has been incorporated into treatment options.  A key indication for good prognosis is treatment intensity.  A minimum of 2-3 hours per week has been specified to produce positive results&lt;ref name=&quot;Van&quot;&gt;Van De Sandt-Koenderman, W. M. E. (2011). Aphasia rehabilitation and the role of computer technology: Can we keep up with modern times? ''International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 13''(1), 21-27.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The main advantage of using computers is that it can greatly increase intensity of therapy.  These programs consist of a large variety of exercises and can be done at home in addition to face-to-face treatment with a therapist.  However, since aphasia presents differently among individuals, these programs must be dynamic and flexible in order to adapt to the variability in impairments.  Another barrier is the capability of computer programs to imitate normal speech and keep up with the speed of regular conversation.  Therefore, computer technology seems to be limited in a communicative setting, however is effective in producing improvements in communication training&lt;ref name=&quot;Van&quot;/&gt;.

Several examples of programs used are StepByStep, Linguagraphica, Computer-Based Visual Communication (C-VIC), TouchSpeak (TS), and Sentence Shaper&lt;ref name=&quot;Van&quot;/&gt;.

[[Melodic intonation therapy]] is often used to treat non-fluent aphasia and has proved to be very effective in some cases&lt;ref&gt;Norton, A., Zipse, L., Marchina, S., &amp; Schlaug, G. (2009). Melodic intonation therapy: Shared insights on how it is done and why it might help. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1169'', 431-436.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian [[papyrus]], the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], which details speech problems in a person with a [[traumatic brain injury]] to the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCrory PR, Berkovic SF |title=Concussion: the history of clinical and pathophysiological concepts and misconceptions |journal=Neurology |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=2283–9 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11756611 |doi= |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/12/2283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The course of the aorta==

The aorta is usually divided into five segments/sections:&lt;ref&gt;Tortora, Gerard J: &quot;Principles of Human W. &amp; Karen A. Koos: ''Human Anatomy, second edition'', page 479. Wm. C. Brown Publishing, 1994. (ISBN 0-697-12252-2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Graaff, Van: &quot;Human Anatomy, fifth edition&quot;, pages 548-549. WCB McGraw-Hill, 1998. (ISBN 0-697-28413-1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ascending aorta]]&amp;mdash;the section between the heart and the arch of aorta
* [[Arch of aorta]]&amp;mdash;the peak part that looks somewhat like an inverted &quot;U&quot;
* [[Descending aorta]]&amp;mdash;the section from the arch of aorta to the point where it divides into the [[common iliac arteries]]
** [[Thoracic aorta]]&amp;mdash;the half of the descending aorta above the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]
** [[Abdominal aorta]]&amp;mdash;the half of the descending aorta below the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]

===In other animals===
&lt;!-- &quot;Ventral aorta&quot; and &quot;Dorsal aorta&quot; link to this section --&gt;
All [[amniote]]s have a broadly similar arrangement to that of humans, albeit with a number of individual variations. In [[fish]], however, there are two separate vessels referred to as aortas. The '''ventral aorta''' carries de-oxygenated blood from the heart to the [[gill]]s; part of this vessel forms the ascending aorta in tetrapods (the remainder forms the [[pulmonary artery]]). A second, '''dorsal aorta''' carries oxygenated blood from the gills to the rest of the body, and is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the descending aorta of tetrapods. The two aortas are connected by a number of vessels, one passing through each of the gills.
[[Amphibian]]s also retain the fifth connecting vessel, so that the aorta has two parallel arches.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 419–421|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embryological development===
In mammalian and avian embryological development, the [[pharyngeal arch]] ([[aortic arches]]) arteries contribute to the normal pattern of the great arteries. The fourth aortic arch vessel survives in these vertebrates as the arch of the aorta, the third aortic arch vessel persists as the brachiocephalic artery or the root of the internal carotid, and the six arch contributes to the pulmonary arteries. The smooth muscle of the great arteries and the population of cells that form the [[aorticopulmonary septum]] that separates the aorta and pulmonary artery is derived from [[cardiac neural crest]]. This contribution of the neural crest to the great artery smooth muscle is unusual as most smooth muscle is derived from mesoderm. In fact the smooth muscle within the abdominal aorta is derived from mesoderm, and the coronary arteries, which arise just above the [[Heart valve|semilunar valves]], possess smooth muscle of mesodermal origin. A failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to divide the great vessels results in [[persistent truncus arteriosus]].

==Features==
The aorta is an [[elastic artery]], and as such is quite distensible. The [[blood pressure]] is highest (normal blood pressure is a reflection of aortic blood pressure) and most pulsatile in the aorta, as blood pressure decreases and becomes more smooth (and less pulsatile) as the blood travels from aorta to arteries to arterioles to capillaries, where metabolic exchange occurs. The aorta consists of a heterogeneous mixture of [[smooth muscle]], nerves, intimal cells, endothelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, and a complex extracellular matrix. The vascular wall consists of several layers known as the [[tunica adventitia]], [[tunica media]], and [[tunica intima]]. The thickness of the aorta encourages an extensive network of tiny blood vessels called [[vaso vasorum]], which feed the layers of the aorta. The aortic arch contains [[baroreceptors]] and [[chemoreceptors]] that relay information concerning blood pressure and blood pH and carbon dioxide levels to the medulla oblongata of the brain. This information is processed by the brain and the [[autonomic nervous system]] mediates the homeostatic responses.

Within the tunica media, smooth muscle and the extracellular matrix are quantitatively the largest components of the aortic vascular wall. The fundamental unit of the aorta is the elastic lamella, which consists of smooth muscle and elastic matrix. The medial layer of the aorta consist of concentric musculoelastic layers (the elastic lamella) in mammals. The smooth muscle component does not dramatically alter the diameter of the aorta but rather serves to increase the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the aortic wall when activated. The elastic matrix dominates the biomechanical properties of the aorta. The elastic matrix forms lamella, consisting of [[elastic fibers]], [[collagens]](predominately type III), [[proteoglycans]], and [[glycoaminoglycans]].  When the left ventricle contracts to force blood into the aorta, the aorta expands. This stretching gives the potential energy that will help maintain blood pressure during [[diastole]], as during this time the aorta contracts passively. This [[Windkessel effect]] of the great elastic arteries has important biomechanical implications. The elastic recoil helps conserve the energy from the pumping heart and smooth out the pulsatile nature created by the heart. Aortic pressure is highest at the aorta and becomes less pulsatile and lower pressure as blood vessels divide into arteries, arterioles, and capillaries such that flow is slow and smooth for gases and nutrient exchange.

==Blood flow and velocity==

The [[Pulsatile_flow|pulsatile]] nature of blood flow creates a pulse wave that is propagated down the [[arterial tree]], and at [[Aortic_bifurcation|bifurcations]] reflected waves rebound to return to semilunar valves and the origin of the [[aorta]]. These return waves create the [[Dicrotic_notch#Ventricular_systole|dicrotic notch]] displayed in the aortic pressure curve during the [[cardiac cycle]] as these reflected waves push on the [[heart valve|aortic semilunar valve]]. With age, the aorta stiffens such that the pulse wave is propagated faster and reflected waves return to the heart faster before the semilunar valve closes, which raises the blood pressure. The stiffness of the aorta is associated with a number of diseases and pathologies, and noninvasive measures of the pulse wave [[Aorta#Blood_flow_and_velocity|velocity]] are an independent indicator of [[hypertension]]. Measuring the pulse wave velocity (invasively and non-invasively) is a means of determining [[arterial stiffness]]. Maximum aortic velocity may be noted as '''V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' or less commonly as '''AoV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

'''Abimelech''' (also spelled '''Abimelek''' or '''Avimelech'''; {{Hebrew Name 2|אֲבִימֶלֶךְ|אֲבִימָלֶךְ|Aviméleḫ|Avimáleḫ|ʼĂḇîméleḵ|ʼĂḇîmāleḵ|&quot;father/leader of a king; my father/leader, a king&quot;}}) was a common name of the [[Philistine]] [[monarch|kings]].

Abimelech was most prominently the name of a king of [[Gerar]] who is mentioned in two of the three [[wife-sister narratives in Genesis]].  The [[Haggada]] identifies them as separate people, the second being the first Abimelech's son, and that his original name was Benmelech (&quot;son of the King&quot;) but changed his name to his father's. At the time of Abimelech, there was an Egyptian governor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] named [[Abimilki]]. They could possibly be the same person. Abimilki's name appears on the [[Amarna]] tablets.

==Etymology==
Abimelech's name has three main translations, though none treats the name as being completely Hebrew, and all are slightly contorted. The first is ''my father is king'', which could be considered simply as a generic title given to a [[crown prince]].  This is supported in the Haggada when &quot;Benmelech&quot; son of Abimelech changes his name to Abimelech when he becomes king.  The other two are more interesting, both essentially being ''my father is MLK'', with [[Moloch|MLK]] being the reference found elsewhere in the Bible in prohibitions such as ''do not pass your children through the fire to MLK'', in which case the following possibilities arise:
*MLK refers to a major [[Canaanite]] deity probably named ''[[Moloch]]'', in which case ''Abimelech'' means ''my father is Moloch'' - a reference to belief in semi-divine kings; or 
*MLK refers to a type of (probably human) sacrifice probably named ''Molk'', so that ''Abimelech'' signifies ''my father is a sacrifice'' - a reference to Abimelech being pious.

==Other people with this name==
Apart from the kings of Gerar, the Bible also records this name for:
*[[Abimelech (Judges)]], proclaimed king after the death of his father Gideon ({{bibleverse||Judges|9:1-6|HE}}). 
*The son of [[Abiathar]], and [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priest]] in the time of David ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|18:16|HE}}). In the parallel passage, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|8:17|HE}}, the name is given as [[Ahimelech]]; most authorities consider this the more correct reading. 
*The king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] better known as [[Achish]], referred to as Abimelech or Achimelech in the title of {{bibleverse||Psalm|34|HE}}.
*Abimélech, Satrap of Gaza is a character (baritone) in Saint-Saëns' opera &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; (Weimar, 1877)

'''Andrew &quot;Tridge&quot; Tridgell''' (born 28 February 1967) is an [[Australia]]n [[computer programmer]] best known as the author of and contributor to the [[Samba (software)|Samba]] [[file server]], and co-inventor of the [[rsync]] algorithm.

He is known for his analysis of complex [[proprietary protocol]]s and [[proprietary software|algorithms]], to allow compatible [[free and open source software]] implementations.

==Projects==
Tridgell was a major developer of the Samba software, analysing the [[Server Message Block]] protocol used for [[workgroup]] and network file sharing by [[Microsoft Windows]] products. He developed the [[talloc]] hierarchical memory allocator, originally as part of Samba.

For his PhD thesis, he co-developed [[rsync]], including the rsync algorithm, a highly efficient [[List of file transfer protocols|file transfer]] and [[File synchronization|synchronization]] tool. He also was the original author of [[rzip]], which uses a similar algorithm to rsync.

He is the author of [http://samba.org/KnightCap/ KnightCap], a [[reinforcement learning|reinforcement-learning]] based [[chess engine]].

Tridgell was also a leader in [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacking]] the [[TiVo]] to make it work in Australia, which uses the [[PAL]] video format.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In April 2005, Tridgell tried to produce free software (now known as [[SourcePuller]]) that interoperated with the [[BitKeeper]] source code repository. This was cited&lt;ref&gt;[http://lwn.net/Articles/169178/ git [LWN.net&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as the reason that BitMover revoked a license allowing [[Linux]] developers free usage of their BitKeeper product. [[Linus Torvalds]], the creator of the Linux kernel, and Tridgell were thus involved in a public debate about the events, in which Tridgell stated that, having not bought or owned BitKeeper and agreed to its license, he couldn't violate it, and was merely analysing the protocol ethically, as he had done with Samba. Tridgell's involvement in the project resulted in Linus accusing him of playing dirty tricks with BitKeeper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/14/torvalds_attacks_tridgell/ Torvalds knifes Tridgell | The Register&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Tridgell claimed his analysis started with simply [[telnet]]ing to a BitKeeper server and typing &lt;code&gt;HELP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20050421023821174 Groklaw - Tridge Speaks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic achievements==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2009}}
Attending [[Barker College]] Hornsby, NSW, Tridgell completed his [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] in 1984. Tridgell completed a [[Bachelor's degree|degree]] with majors in [[applied mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1988, before moving to [[Canberra]] to complete an [[Honours degree]] at the [[Australian National University]], in which he received first class honours in [[theoretical physics]].

Tridgell completed a [[PhD]] at the Computer Sciences Laboratory of the [[Australian National University]]. His original doctorate work was in the area of [[speech recognition]] but was never completed. His submitted thesis 'Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and Synchronization' was based on his work on the [[rsync]] algorithm.

==Employment==
Tridgell started his career working for [[Efam Resources]] from 1987 to 1988, designing [[computer modeling|computer models]] of [[financial markets]]. His work led to a product named The Options Analyst, which he marketed and sold for five years.

From 1988 to 1989, Tridgell worked as a software developer for a company named Sonartech Pty Ltd (now Sonartech Atlas), which developed [[sonar]] technologies for Australian [[submarine]]s. He worked on [[Sonar|passive sonar]] technology.

Between 1989 and 1990, Tridgell was employed at the Research School of Biological Sciences in the Australian National University, making computer models of physical and biological events and environments such as bushfire spread and [[population dynamics]].

From 1991 to 1999, Tridgell held various other positions at the Australian National University, such as [[UNIX]] administration, [[satellite]] control, and [[supercomputer]] research.  During this period he was seconded to the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Computational Systems, where he headed the PIOuS (Parallel Input/Output System) project - later HiDIOS (High-performance Distributed Input/Output System) - for parallel file systems on the Fujitsu AP1000 and AP+ supercomputers. Tridgell also went on to lecture, first as an associate lecturer, and then as a casual lecturer, in the university's Computer Science division. He remains a Visiting Fellow of the University.

In mid-1999, Tridgell joined the [[Levanta|LinuxCare]] company's office in Canberra as their first Australian employee. He helped to assemble 14 staff for a research and development team known as [[Ozlabs|OzLabs]]. [[Linux]] and open-source companies were quite a new concept at this stage. Tridgell was made a research fellow of Linuxcare in 2000.

In March 2001, Tridgell joined [[VA Software|VA Linux Systems]].  He worked in the [[network attached storage]] division for VA Linux Systems, making enhancements to Samba and the [[Linux kernel]] to provide enhanced performance for their network-attached storage device range.

Tridgell continued his work with network-attached storage technologies when he joined [[Quantum Corporation]] as a Senior Engineer in the Storage Systems Group. His role once again involved developing functionality and efficiency modifications into Samba to enhance Quantum's GuardianOS-powered [[Snap Server]] network-attached storage device. One of the features that he added to Samba at this time was support for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active Directory]] technology, a new authentication system introduced with Microsoft's [[Windows 2000|Windows 2000 Server]] product range.

In 2004, Tridgell was employed by [[IBM]] working remotely for the [[Almaden Research Center]]. In January 2005, he joined the [[OSDL]] on a one-year fellowship;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osdl.org/newsroom/press_releases/2005/2005_01_17_beaverton.html&lt;/ref&gt; he then returned to IBM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osdl.org/newsroom/press_releases/2006/2006_Feb_01_beaverton.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, Andrew Tridgell (with Bob Edwards) taught a course titled [[COMP8440 Free and Open Source Software Development]] at the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp8440/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
* In October 2003, [[The Bulletin]] magazine judged Tridgell to be Australia's smartest [[Information and Communications Technology]] person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.ninemsn.com.au/smart100/default.asp The Bulletin Smart 100&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=135066 The Bulletin publishes for the last time&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2006, the [[Free Software Foundation]] awarded Tridgell its 2005 [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]], for his work on Samba, the Linux kernel, and rsync. Tridgell was considered to have furthered an important goal of the free software movement since the founding of [[GNU]], analyzing ways for free software to interact with widespread proprietary systems to allow people to more easily move away from those systems.
* In July 2008, Tridgell was named &quot;Best Interoperator&quot; at the [[Google-O'Reilly Open Source Awards]], for his work on [[Samba (software)|Samba]] and [[Rsync]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/07/and-winners-of-2008-google-oreilly-open.html Google Open Source Blog: ... and the winners of the 2008 Google-O'Reilly Open Source Awards are&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applesoft BASIC''' was a dialect of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] supplied with the [[Apple II series]] of computers.  It superseded [[Integer BASIC]] and was the BASIC in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in all Apple II series computers after the original [[Apple II#Apple II|Apple II]] model.  It was also referred to as '''FP''' (from &quot;[[floating point]]&quot;) because of the command used to invoke it instead of INT for Integer BASIC.  Applesoft BASIC was supplied by [[Microsoft]] and its name is derived from the names of both [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Microsoft.  Apple employees, including [[Randy Wigginton]], adapted Microsoft's interpreter for the Apple II and added several features.  The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 only on cassette tape and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics. '''Applesoft II''', which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978. It is this latter version, which has some syntax differences from the first as well as support for the Apple II high-resolution graphics modes, that most people mean by the term &quot;Applesoft.&quot;

==Background==
Apple's customers were demanding a version of BASIC that supported [[floating point]] calculations. As [[Steve Wozniak]], the creator of Integer BASIC and the only person who understood it well enough to add floating point features, was busy with the [[Disk II]] drive and controller and with [[Apple DOS]], Apple turned to Microsoft, who was the BASIC vendor of choice after their success with [[Altair BASIC]], and licensed a 10 KB [[assembly language]] version of BASIC dubbed &quot;Applesoft.&quot; Apple reportedly obtained an eight-year license for Applesoft BASIC from Microsoft for a flat fee of $21,000, renewing it in 1985 through an arrangement that gave Microsoft the rights and source code for Apple's Macintosh version of BASIC.

Applesoft was similar to (and indeed had a common code base with) BASIC implementations on other [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]-based computers, such as [[Commodore BASIC]]: it used line numbers, and spaces were not necessary in lines.  While Applesoft was slower than Integer BASIC, it had many features that the older BASIC lacked:
* Atomic strings: A string is no longer an array of characters (as in Integer BASIC and [[C (programming language)|C]]); it is instead a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] object (as in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). This allows for string arrays; &lt;code&gt;DIM A$(10)&lt;/code&gt; resulted in a [[Array data type|vector]] of ''eleven'' string variables numbered 0–10.
* Multidimensional [[Array data type|arrays]]
* Single-precision [[floating point]] variables with an 8-bit exponent and a 31-bit significand and improved math capabilities, including trigonometry and logarithmic functions
* Commands for high-resolution graphics
* &lt;code&gt;CHR$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STR$&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt; functions for converting between string and numeric types (both languages did have the &lt;code&gt;ASC&lt;/code&gt; function)
* [[User-defined function]]s: simple one-line functions written in BASIC, with a single parameter
* Error-trapping, allowing BASIC programs to handle unexpected errors by means of a subroutine written in BASIC
Conversely, Applesoft lacked the &lt;code&gt;MOD&lt;/code&gt; (remainder) operator that had been present in Integer BASIC.

Whereas Wozniak originally referred to his Integer BASIC as &quot;Game BASIC,&quot; having written it so he could write a [[Breakout clone]] for his new computer, few [[action game]]s were written in Applesoft BASIC for several reasons:

* In that era of carefully counting clock cycles and limited memory, it was inefficient to write speed-dependent programs that ran on a [[runtime interpreter]].
* The use of &quot;real&quot; (floating-point) numbers for all math operations created unnecessary overhead and degraded performance. Applesoft converted integer numbers to real before performing operations on them, converting the result back to an integer only if it was to be assigned to a (16-bit signed) integer variable.
* [[Shape table]]s were a slow alternative to [[bitmap]]s. No provision existed for mixing text and graphics, except for the limited &quot;hardware split screen&quot; of the Apple II (four lines of text at the bottom of the screen). Many graphics programs thus contained their own bitmap character generator routines. No provision was added in the 128 kB [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIc]] models' BASIC interpreters for the new machines' extra memory and double-resolution graphics, or for the [[Apple IIgs|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;'s]] 16-color mode. ([[Beagle Bros]] offered machine-language workarounds for these problems.)
* The program was stored as a [[linked list]] of lines; a &lt;code&gt;[[GOTO]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[GOSUB]]&lt;/code&gt; took [[Computational complexity theory|O(n) (linear) time]], and although Applesoft programs were not very long compared to today's software, on a 1&amp;nbsp;MHz 6502 this could be a significant bottleneck.  Large programs were often written with the most-used subroutines at the top of the program to reduce the processing time for &lt;code&gt;GOSUB&lt;/code&gt; calls.
* No sound support aside from a &lt;code&gt;[[PEEK and POKE|PEEK]]&lt;/code&gt; command that could be used to click the speaker, though one could also &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; an ASCII [[bell character]] to sound the system alert [[beep (sound)|beep]].  The language was not fast enough to produce more than a baritone buzz from repeated clicks anyway.  However, music spanning several octaves could be played by repeated calls to a machine-language tone generator.

==Sample code==
[[File:Applesoft BASIC.png|thumb|[[Hello World]], with [[inverse video]] and [[bell character]], run then listed]]
[[Hello World]] in Applesoft BASIC could be entered as the following:
 10 TEXT:HOME
 20 ?&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;

Multiple commands could be included on the same line of code if separated by a colon (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;).  The &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; can be used in Applesoft BASIC as a shortcut for &quot;PRINT&quot;, though spelling out the word is not only acceptable but canonical&amp;mdash;Applesoft converted &quot;?&quot; in entered programs to the same token as  &quot;PRINT&quot;, thus either would appear as &quot;PRINT&quot; when a program was listed. The program above would be appear in a &lt;code&gt;LIST&lt;/code&gt; command as:
 10  TEXT : HOME
 20  PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;

==Apple Business BASIC==
Apple Business BASIC shipped with the [[Apple ///]] computer. Donn Denman ported Applesoft BASIC to [[Apple SOS|SOS]] and reworked it to take advantage of the extended memory of the Apple ///.  Following the trend of avoiding absolute addresses, the PEEK and POKE commands were replaced with INVOKE and PERFORM statements that loaded and executed separately-assembled code modules.

* Despite its heritage, Applesoft lacked commands common to most other Microsoft BASIC interpreters, such as INSTR (which searched for a substring in a given string; this had to be done manually with loops and the MID$ function), PRINT USING (which formatted numbers with commas and currency signs according to a format string), and INKEY$ (which checked for a keypress without stopping the program as Applesoft's GET command—analogous to the INPUT$ function—did, although a PEEK location did provide this functionality). It seems likely that memory constraints were at the root of these differences, as the Apple II ROM had only 10 kilobytes available for the interpreter, and the improved hi-res graphics support was clearly a higher priority. Microsoft's CLS command (for clearing the screen) was renamed HOME in Applesoft.
* There was a well-documented bug in Applesoft BASIC that could actually crash the interpreter if ONERR GOTO was in effect and numerous program errors occurred. Apple provided a short assembly-language routine which could be POKEd into RAM and CALLed to ameliorate the problem to an extent. Later it was discovered by an enterprising hacker that the required code was actually in the Applesoft ROM (though it was never executed) and could be called there instead: CALL -3288 or (equivalent) 62248.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txbobsc.com/scsc/scdocumentor/ Disassembled ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applesoft could be extended by two means: the ampersand (&amp;amp;) command and the USR() function. These were two functions that called machine-language functions stored in memory. Routines that needed to be as fast or required direct access to arbitrary functions or data in memory could thus be called from a higher-level interpreted BASIC program.  Additionally, these lower-level functions could read the data immediately following the &quot;&amp;&quot; or &quot;USR&quot; command, allowing a BASIC program to pass parameters to the functions.
* Both Integer BASIC and Applesoft used [[tokenizing]] to reduce the memory requirements of programs and to speed their interpretation. As code was entered, BASIC keywords would be converted to single-byte tokens; the process was reversed when the program was listed. Integer BASIC used characters with codes above 127 for normal text and codes below 128 for tokens; Applesoft used exactly the reverse. Unlike Integer BASIC, Applesoft did not tokenize literal numbers appearing in the code but stored them digit by digit. As a result of the tokenizing process, programmers could not use any variable name that had the name of one of the BASIC commands (e.g. a person could not use the name &quot;SCORE&quot; because the &quot;OR&quot; would invoke a [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] operator, and &quot;BACKGROUND&quot; could similarly not be used because &quot;GR&quot; would invoke the low-resolution graphics system; both would create syntax errors).
* Applesoft, like Integer BASIC before it, did not come with any built-in commands for dealing with files or disks, other than a feature to save programs to, and load programs from, [[audiotape]]. The Apple II disk operating system, known simply as DOS, thus intercepted all input typed at the BASIC command prompt to determine whether it was a DOS command. Similarly, all output was scrutinized for a Control-D character (ASCII 4), which BASIC programs would send before seemingly PRINTing a disk command to get DOS's attention (the disk commands would not really get PRINTed but were intercepted by DOS and prevented from making it to the screen output).&lt;ref&gt;The DOS Manual for Apple II, Apple Computer, Inc., 1980, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]] followed this lead, although the BASIC command interpreter was placed in a separate program called BASIC.SYSTEM and the hook worked in a different manner.&lt;ref&gt;Apple II ProDOS Manual, Apple Computer, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Variable names were limited to two letters; they could be made longer, but only the first two letters would be used. For instance, &quot;LOW&quot; and &quot;LOSS&quot; would be treated as the same variable, and attempting to assign a value to &quot;LOSS&quot; would overwrite any value assigned to &quot;LOW.&quot;

'''''Asterix''''' or '''''The Adventures of Asterix''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Astérix'''''   or '''''Astérix le Gaulois'''}}, {{IPA-fr|asteʁiks lə ɡolwa|IPA}}) is a [[List of Asterix volumes|series]] of [[French language|French]] [[comic book]]s written by [[René Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]] (Uderzo also took over the job of writing the series after the death of Goscinny in 1977). The series first appeared in French in the magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on October 29, 1959. As of 2009, 34 comic books in the series have been released.

The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient [[Gaul]]s as they resist [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their [[druid]], which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character, [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], along with his friend [[Obelix]] have various adventures. The &quot;ix&quot; suffix of both names echoes the name of [[Vercingetorix]], a historical Gaul chieftain. In many cases, the stories have them travel to various countries around the world, though other books are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The Asterix series is one of the most popular [[Franco-Belgian comics]] in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most [[Europe]]an countries. Asterix is less well known in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into [[List of Asterix films|11 films]]; eight animated, and three with live actors. There have also been a number of [[List of Asterix games|games]] based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, [[Parc Astérix]], is themed around the series. To date, 325&amp;nbsp;million copies of 34 Asterix books have been sold worldwide, making co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo France's bestselling authors abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volumes-sold&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last= volumes-sold | title = Asterix the Gaul rises sky high | url= http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-43015020091008 | work=Reuters | date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Buzz.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-3-2004-54995.asp |title=Goscinny and Uderzo |author=Sonal Panse |date= |work= |publisher=Buzzle.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to creating the Asterix series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was published in the [[Tintin (magazine)|''Tintin'']] magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comic creator&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lambiek.net/home.htm|title=René Goscinny|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Comic creator |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Astérix'' was originally serialised in the magazine ''[[Pilote]]'', in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pilote-1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =BDoubliées | title =Pilote année 1959 | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the first book was put together entitled ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]''. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis.

Uderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kessler |first1= Peter |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Asterix Complete Guide |trans_title= |url= |accessdate= 11 March 2010 |type= |edition= First |series= |volume= |date=2 |year=1995 |month=Nov |origyear= |publisher=Hodder Children's Books;  |location= |isbn=0340653469 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing popularity of Asterix with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased. Pilote was taken over by [[Dargaud|Georges Dargaud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;/&gt;

When Goscinny died, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions [[Albert-René]], which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;/&gt; However, [[Dargaud]], the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).

Although Uderzo declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request [[Hergé]] made regarding his ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now own the rights. This has provoked a family row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techland.com/2009/01/21/an-open-letter-to-albert-uderzo/ |title=An Open Letter to Albert Uderzo |author=Matt Selman|date=21 January 2009|work= |publisher=Techland.com |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, has attacked her father's decision for selling the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new ''Astérix'' adventures after his death. She is reported as saying &quot;...the co-creator of ''Astérix'', France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans - the men of industry and finance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shirbon | first=Estelle | work=[[Reuters]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | title=Asterix battles new Romans in publishing dispute| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm | title=Divisions emerge in Asterix camp | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goscinny also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodoi.info/magazine/2009-01-20/anne-goscinny-%C2%ABasterix-a-eu-deja-eu-deux-vies-du-vivant-de-mon-pere-et-apres-pourquoi-pas-une-troisieme%C2%BB/10581|title=Anne Goscinny: «Astérix a eu déjà eu deux vies, du vivant de mon père et après.

''[[Asterix Conquers Rome]]'' is a comic book adaptation of the animated film ''[[The Twelve Tasks of Asterix]]''. It was released in 1976, making it technically the 23rd ''Asterix'' volume to be published. But it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to the series. The only English translation ever to be published was in the ''Asterix Annual 1980'' Except when it was published as a standalone volume in 1984.

In 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled ''[[Astérix et ses Amis]]'', a 60 pages comic book made up of various short stories (from one to four strips). It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on the occasion of his 80th birthday by 34 renowned European comics artists. The volume was translated into nine languages, but has not yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |title=Les albums hors collection - Astérix et ses Amis - Hommage à Albert Uderzo |publisher=Asterix.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis and characters==
{{Main|Characters in Asterix}}
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in [[Armorica]], a province of [[Gaul]] (modern [[France]]), in the year 50 BC. [[Julius Caesar]] has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the [[Roman Empire]]. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village [[druid]], [[Getafix]].

The main protagonist and hero of the village is [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend, [[Obelix]], who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength. Obelix is usually accompanied by [[Dogmatix]], his little dog.

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul ([[Lutetia]], [[Corsica]] etc.), neighbouring nations ([[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Germany]] etc.), and far away lands ([[North America]], [[Middle East]], [[India]] etc.).

The series employs [[science-fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of [[extraterrestrials]] in ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'' and the city of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]''.

==Humour==
{{Main|Humour in Asterix}}
The humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics is typically French, often centering on puns, caricatures, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary European nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the [[Italian language|Italian]] translation, the Roman legionnaires are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous &quot;''Ils sont fous ces romains''&quot; (&quot;These Romans are crazy&quot;) is translated as &quot;Sono pazzi questi romani&quot;, alluding to the Roman abbreviation ''[[SPQR]]''. In another example: [[Hiccups]] are written [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] in French as &quot;hips,&quot; but in English as &quot;hic,&quot; allowing Roman legionnaries in at least one of the English translations to [[declension|decline]] their hiccups in Latin (&quot;hic, haec, hoc&quot;). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm |title=The vital statistics of Asterix |author= |date=18 October 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this [[stereotyping]], and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French [[chauvinism]], the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.

==Translations==
The 34 books or albums (one of which is a compendium of short stories) in the series have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original [[French language|French]], most albums are available in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[English language|English]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (and [[Brazilian Portuguese]]), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|modern Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Asterix around the World&quot;/&gt; Beyond modern Europe, some albums have also been translated into languages as diverse as [[Esperanto]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Afrikaans Language|Afrikaans]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindi]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[West Frisian language|Frisian]], [[Latin]], [[Romansch language|Romansch]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] (Singhalese) and [[Attic Greek|Ancient Greek]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Asterix around the World&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/ |title=Asterix around the World |author=|date= |work= |publisher=asterix-obelix-nl.com  |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Finland]], [[Poland]] and especially in [[Germany]], several volumes were translated into a variety of regional [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s, such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Breton language|Breton]], Chtimi ([[Picard language|Picard]]) and [[Corsican language|Corsican]] in France, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]], [[Swabian German|Swabian]] and [[Low German]] in Germany, [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] and [[Silesian language|Silesianin]] in Poland, and [[Savonian dialects|Savo]], [[Karelia]], [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] and [[Helsinki slang]] dialects in Finland. Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, [[Asterix the Gaul]], was translated into local language [[Mirandese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Asterix.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asterix.com/encyclopedia/translations/ |title=Translations |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Asterix.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the [[Cretan Greek]], [[Cypriot Greek]] and [[Pontic Greek]] dialects and in [[Attic Greek|Ancient Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = List of Asterix comics published in Greece by Mamouth Comix | url =http://www.mamouthcomix.gr/asterix/index.html | language = Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Netherlands]] several volumes were translated into [[West Frisian language|Frisian]], a language related to [[Old English language|Old English]] spoken in the province of [[Friesland]]. Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], a regional language spoken not only in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]] but also in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]]. [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]-language books have been issued in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] for the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority living in [[Serbia]]. Although not a fully autonomic dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in [[Hungary]]. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] (''Singhalese'') as Sura Pappa, The only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asterix.com&quot;/&gt;
In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak [[Romanesco|Romanesque]] dialect

===Theme park===

{{Main|Parc Astérix}}

[[Parc Asterix]], a theme park 22 miles north of [[Paris]], based upon the series, was opened in 1989. It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 1.6&amp;nbsp;million visitors per year.

==Influence in popular culture==
[[File:Asterixchips.JPG|thumb|Asterix ham and cheese-flavored [[potato chips]]]]
*The first [[France|French]] satellite, which was launched in 1965, was named ''[[Astérix (satellite)|Astérix-1]]'' in honour of Asterix. Asteroid [[29401 Asterix]] was also named in honor of the character. Coincidentally, the word Asterix/Asterisk originates from the Greek for ''Little Star''.
*During the campaign for [[Paris]] to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] Asterix appeared in many posters over the [[Eiffel Tower]].
*The French company [[Kraft Foods|Belin]] introduced a series of &quot;Asterix&quot; [[potato chips]] shaped in the forms of [[scutum (shield)|Roman shields]], [[gourd]]s, [[wild boar]], and [[bone]]s.
* In the UK in 1995, Asterix coins were presented free in every [[Nutella]] jar.
* Asterix and Obelix appeared on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' for a special edition about [[France]]. In a 2009 issue of the same magazine, Asterix is described as being seen by some as a symbol for France's independence and defiance of globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html | work=TIME | title= Asterix at 50: The Comic Hero Conquers the World | date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2009 | first=Leo | last=Cendrowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Asterix has made several promotional appearances for fast food chain McDonald's, including one advertisement which featured members of the village enjoying the traditional story-ending feast at a McDonald's restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/asterix-the-gaul-seen-feasting-at-mcdonald-s-restaurant |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2010|title=Asterix the Gaul seen feasting at McDonald's restaurant }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The animated series ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' also concerns an oppressed group in possession of a magic potion capable of conferring superhuman strength and agility.
* The [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] final between France and Italy was depicted in newspapers as a fight between Roman legions and Gaulish villagers.
* Version 4.0 of the operating system [[OpenBSD]] features a parody of an Asterix story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/40.html |title=OpenBSD 4.0 homepage |publisher=Openbsd.org |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Action Comics]]'' Number 579, published by [[DC Comics]] in 1986, written by [[Jean-Marc Lofficier|Lofficier]] and Illustrated by [[Keith Giffen]], featured an homage to Asterix where [[Superman]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] are drawn back in time to a small village of indomitable Gauls.
* [[Lisa Simpson]] is delighted at the sight of a rack with [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]] and Asterix comics in a comic book store, depicted in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Husbands and Knives]]&quot;.
* Obelix is referenced in [[The King Blues]]' 2008 single &quot;[[My Boulder]]&quot;. The song features the lyrics, &quot;If I'm Obelix, you are my boulder&quot;.
* On 29 October 2009, the Google homepage of a great number of countries displayed a logo commemorating 50 years of Asterix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com.tw/logos/asterix09.gif |title= Asterix's anniversary|author= Google |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arizona Cardinals''' are a professional [[American football|football]] team based in [[Glendale, Arizona]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. They are currently members of the [[NFC West|Western Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Cardinals were founded in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional American football club in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.azcardinals.com/history/franchise.html Arizona Cardinals team history, azcardinals.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The team was established in [[Chicago]] in 1898 and was a charter member of the NFL in {{NFL Year|1920}}. Along with the [[Chicago Bears]], the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league's founding. (The [[Green Bay Packers]] were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). The club moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in {{Cardinals NFL season|1960}} and played in that city through {{Cardinals NFL season|1987}} (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Football Cardinals&quot; and / or the &quot;Big Red&quot; to avoid confusion with the Major League Baseball [[St. Louis Cardinals]]). Other less commonly used nicknames were the &quot;Gridbirds&quot; ( used only by a local newspaper columnist ) or &quot;Cardiac Cards&quot; ( used only to refer to the 1975 team ) Before the [[1988 NFL season]], the team moved to [[Tempe, Arizona]], a college town suburb of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 years at [[Arizona State University]]'s [[Sun Devil Stadium]]. In {{nfly|2006}}, the club began playing all home games at the newly constructed [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in the northwestern suburb of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]].

The franchise has two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in {{Cardinals NFL season|1925}}, but is the subject of [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|controversy]], with supporters of the [[Pottsville Maroons]] believing that Pottsville should have gotten the title. Their second title, and the first to be received through a championship game, came in {{Cardinals NFL season|1947}}, two decades before the first [[Super Bowl]] game was played. In the six-plus decades since winning the championship in 1947, the team suffered many losing seasons. They have been to the playoffs six times and have won six playoff games, three of which were victories during their run in the [[NFL playoffs, 2008–09|2008-09 NFL Playoffs]]. During that season, they reached [[Super Bowl XLIII]]. The team has also won four division titles ({{nfly|1974}}, {{nfly|1975}}, {{nfly|2008}}, and {{nfly|2009}}) since their 1947&amp;ndash;1948 NFL championship game appearances. In addition, the club won one [[NFC Championship Game]] in 2008. 

The Cardinals conduct their annual summer training camp at [[Northern Arizona University]] in Flagstaff.

[[Image:NFC-Throwback-Uniform-ARI.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Arizona Cardinals uniform: 1996&amp;ndash;2004]]

The team has used cardinal red jerseys since [[Chris O'Brien (American football)|Chris O'Brien]] bought them for the club in 1898. For most of their history, the Cardinals have used the same basic uniform design of white helmets, white pants with red stripes on the sides, and either red or white jerseys.

[[Image:Chicago cardinals.png|left|thumb|150px|Chicago Cardinals logo.]]
Starting in {{Cardinals NFL season|1947}}, the team had a logo of a [[Northern Cardinal|cardinal bird]] perched on the stitches of a football. However, the club did not attach a logo to their helmets until they debuted a cardinal-head logo in {{Cardinals NFL season|1960}}, the year the franchise moved from Chicago to St. Louis. The Cardinals moved to Arizona in {{Cardinals NFL season|1988}}, and the [[flag of Arizona]] was added to the sleeves the following year. In {{Cardinals NFL season|1990}}, the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys.

In {{nfly|1994}}, the Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking &quot;CC&quot; logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for the two games, at Cleveland (Sept. 18) and home vs. Pittsburgh (Oct. 30).

In {{nfly|2005}}, the team unveiled its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated to be a more aggressive version of its predecessor, making it look meaner. Numerous fans had called the previous version a &quot;[[parakeet]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6877757/ &quot;Arizona brushes up logo of outdated bird&quot;, MSNBC.com January 29, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Black again became an accent color after an eight-year absence, while trim lines were added to the outside shoulders, sleeves, and sides of the jerseys and pants. Both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants.

Hoping to break a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on October 29, 2006, in a game at [[Lambeau Field]] against the Green Bay Packers. The Packers won 31&amp;ndash;14, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 1&amp;ndash;7 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27&amp;ndash;10. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in {{Cardinals NFL season|2007}}, the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in {{Cardinals NFL season|2008}}, but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in {{Cardinals NFL season|2009}}. They have yet to be paired with the white road jerseys since the 2007 game at Seattle.

The Cardinals' first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season&amp;mdash;forcing opponents to suffer in darker-colored jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and most other home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70°F (21°C), the team opted wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the [[Denver Broncos]].

The Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the [[Houston Texans]] on October 11, {{NFL Year|2009}}. In October 2009, the NFL recognized [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]], and players wore pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes. The team thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/KentSomers/66308&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Cardinals NFL season|2010}} season saw the Cardinals debut a new, alternate black jersey. Prior to its introduction, the Cardinals were the only NFL team without an alternate jersey or throwback kit, save for the NFL's 75th anniversary program in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;UniWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/ |title=There’s No Service Like Wire Service, Vol. 6 |date= |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
The Cardinals' flagship radio station was [[KMVP]], &quot;[[ESPN Radio]] 860.&quot; KMVP assumed the broadcast rights in 2006 after many years on [[KSLX-FM]] and [[KDUS]]. [[Dave Pasch]], [[Ron Wolfley]], and [[Paul Calvisi]] handle the radio broadcast. Most preseason games are televised on [[KNXV]], channel 15, the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate. [[Mike Goldberg]] and [[Glenn Parker]] are the TV announcers.

On [[New Year's Day]] 2007, KMVP began a simulcast of [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]], which switched to an all-sports format (the news/talk station became 92.3, [[KTAR-FM]]). For the 2007 season, KTAR was the official flagship station; however, some broadcasts were also heard on 92.3 FM because of conflicts with [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] baseball games on 620 AM.

==Miscellaneous==
Due to Phoenix's high temperature and strong sunshine in early September, eight of the team's first 13 home openers in Arizona were held, at earliest, in week three. In 1990 and 1991, the Cardinals opened with three consecutive road games before finally coming home in week four. For the same reason, the team's home opener was a nationally-televised night game (two Monday Night Football games and 12 Sunday Night Football games) from 1988 to 2001. The team hosted ten straight home openers as Sunday Night Football games from 1989 to 1998.

The '''Atlanta Falcons''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They are a member of the [[NFC South|South Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965 as an [[expansion team]], after the NFL offered then-owner [[Rankin Smith]] a franchise to keep him from joining the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL). The AFL instead granted a franchise to [[Miami, Florida]] (the [[Miami Dolphins]]).  In their 45 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 298–402–6 with division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, and 2010.  Their first and only Super Bowl appearance was [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] in 1999.

==Franchise history==
{{details|History of the Atlanta Falcons}}
Once a stadium, Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, was built, Atlantans felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football. One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the [[American Football League]] and the NFL, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.

With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 7, 1965, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta. He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues. On June 30 Rankin Smith and the NFL were the choice.

The Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965 when [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] granted ownership to [[Rankin Smith Sr.]] The expansion team was awarded the first pick in the [[1966 NFL Draft]] as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.&lt;ref name=HOF1966&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.jsp?story_id=1998|title=1966 NFL Draft|accessdate=September 27, 2008 |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcons drafted [[All-American]] [[Linebacker]] [[Tommy Nobis]] from the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]] with the first pick of the [[1966 NFL Draft|draft]], making him the first-ever Falcon. The [[National Football League|league]] also held the [[1966 NFL Expansion Draft]] six weeks later in which the Falcons selected unprotected players from existing franchises.The Falcons selected many good players in drafts, but they still could not win.
The Falcons had their first season in {{nfly|1966}}, and their first preseason game on August 1, {{nfly|1966}}, losing to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. They lost their first nine regular-season games and secured their first victory on the road against the [[New York Giants]]. The team finished the 1960s with only 12 wins. The Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in [[Atlanta]] during the 1970 season. The 1971 season was their first with a winning record.

In the 1978 season, the Falcons entered their first playoff series and won the Wild Card game against the Philadelphia Eagles 14–13. The following week, they lost to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.

In 1980, after a nine game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 30–24. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss.

In 1989, the Falcons drafted CB [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. &quot;Neon Deion&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Prime Time&quot;) had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[the New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.

In 1991, the Falcons drafted [[Brett Favre]] as the thirty-third overall pick. But the Falcons' season ended in a loss to the [[Washington Redskins]] in the divisional playoffs.

In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome. Head coach Jerry Glanville had never wanted to draft Brett Favre and traded him to the Packers.

In 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] led the &quot;Dirty Bird&quot; Falcons to their greatest season to date. On November 8, they won 41–10 over the [[New England Patriots]], ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a 14–2 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 18, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded 15–1 [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] at [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Minnesota]] in the NFC Championship Game, 30–27 in an epic overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they were defeated 34–19, by the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].

In the [[2001 NFL Draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for [[wide receiver]] [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on [[running back]] [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]). Co-founder of [[Home Depot]] [[Arthur Blank]] purchased the Falcons franchise on December 6, 2001. Michael Vick saw minimal playing time in 2001, playing backup and learning the system under starting QB Chris Chandler. Vick was the named starting quarterback for the 2002 season. Setting many records and supplying the media with numerous highlights for the season, including rushing for 173 yards in an overtime win at Minnesota, the highest single-game rushing total for an NFL quarterback ever, Vick led the Falcons to the playoffs. During their ensuing playoff run, the Falcons were the first team in history to claim a playoff win over the Green Bay Packers 27–7 in Lambeau Field. Their season ended with a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles 20–6 in the divisional playoffs.

On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo. “The new Atlanta Falcons logo is fresh, strong and dynamic, and yet appreciates the tradition and history of this franchise,” said Falcons owner and CEO Arthur Blank. “The new logo depicts a more powerful, aggressive Falcon – one of fast movement. It is also representative of the evolution and direction of our team.” During the 2003 preseason Michael Vick broke his leg and missed the first twelve games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. [[Wade Phillips]] acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Michael Vick, they ended up with a dismal 5–11 record that year.

New head coach [[Jim L. Mora]] was hired and Michael Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]], when the Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earn a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the St. Louis Rams 47–17 in the Georgia Dome, advancing to the NFC Championship, which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] 27–10. The [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] fell short again of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8–8. In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and Bobby Petrino, the University of Louisville's football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]], Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster. In the beginning of the 2007 season, the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] were forced to start Joey Harrington at quarterback. On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, [[Bobby Petrino]] resigned without notice to coach at the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|University of Arkansas]], leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room. [[Secondary Coach]] [[Emmitt Thomas]] was named interim coach for the final three games of 2007 on December 12.

On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named the former Patriots director of college football scouting [[Thomas Dimitroff]] General Manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Staff/Executive/Thomas_Dimitroff.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 2008, [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens [[Mike Smith (American football)|Mike Smith]] was named the Falcons' new head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Coaches/Mike_Smith.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] agreed to a 6-year deal worth $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Players/Active/Michael_Turner.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] (quarterback from Boston College) was drafted third overall in the [[2008 NFL Draft]]. He started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Players/Active/Matt_Ryan.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11–5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/teams/atlantafalcons/statistics?team=ATL NFL.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2008, Atlanta Falcons beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], 30–24.

The Atlanta Falcons hold the record among all major American sports leagues for the longest streak of seasons without consecutive winning seasons, a streak that lasted from 1966–2008. Though they failed to make the playoffs, the streak ended in 2009 when the Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20–10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9–7. In 2010, with a regular season record of 13–3, their best regular season record since the 1998 Super Bowl season, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual [[Super Bowl XLV]] champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48-21.

===2011===
{{main|2011 Atlanta Falcons Season}}
The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the [[2011 NFL Draft]] to select Alabama wide receiver [[Julio Jones]]. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their second and fourth round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansas-city-news.pro/2011/04/atlanta-falcons-trade-up-to-get-julio.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo and uniforms==

[[Image:NFC-Throwback-Uniform-ATL.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Atlanta Falcons uniform: 1997–2002]]
When the team debuted in [[1966 Atlanta Falcons season|1966]], the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by 2 gold stripes and 2 white stripes, These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (White and Gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (Red and Black) Although the gold was later taken out, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978.

A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]] but was never worn.

In [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Alumni/Uniform_History.aspx &quot;Falcons Uniform History&quot;], NFL&lt;/ref&gt; (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)

Both the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]]. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/fans/article.jsp?id=699 &quot;Falcons Unveil New Logo&quot;], NFL&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.

In [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], winning the first two contests (24–21 in {{nfly|2004}} and 36–17 in {{nfly|2005}}), but losing 31–13 in {{nfly|2006}}. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for 4 straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time).

In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome.  It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for 2 home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. Both of those game the Falcons won. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well.

Preseason games not shown nationally television (except NBC-aired games) are seen on [[NBC]] affiliate [[WXIA]], also known as &quot;11 Alive.&quot; In 2008, preseason games aired on [[WATL-TV]] due to WXIA's commitment to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Both stations are owned by [[Gannett Company]].

Fox affiliate [[WAGA-TV]] aired most preseason games through the 2004 season. WAGA continues to have a relationship with the Falcons as their primary broadcaster of regular season games (serving in this capacity since the Falcons started play), which dates back to when WAGA was a [[CBS]] affiliate and the NFL/NFC games were on CBS. WATL aired most Falcons games in 1994, as WAGA did not switch to Fox until December 1994.

[[File:Valknut-Symbol-triquetra.svg||thumb|200px|The [[Valknut]] symbol.]]
'''''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}''''' (from [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] for &quot;[[Æsir]] faith&quot;, pronounced {{IPA-is|auːsatruː|}}, in [[Old Norse]] {{IPA-non|aːsatruː|}}) in the [[United States]] is a form of [[Germanic Neopaganism]], in particular inspired by the [[Norse paganism]] as described in the [[Edda]]s and as practiced prior to the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]]. 

There are three national organizations of Nordic Paganism in the United States, [[Ásatrú Alliance]], [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] and [[The Troth]], besides numerous smaller or regional associations.  
Historically, the main dispute between these has generally centered on the interpretation of &quot;Nordic heritage&quot; as either something cultural, or as something genetic or racial (&quot;[[metagenetic]]&quot;). In the internal discourse within American Asatru, this cultural/racial divide has long been known as &quot;universalist&quot; vs. &quot;folkish&quot; Asatru.&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), pp. 134f.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
[[The Troth]] takes the &quot;universalist&quot; position,  claiming ''Asatru'' as a synonym for &quot;Northern European Heathenry&quot; taken to comprise &quot;many variations, names, and practices, including [[Theodism]], Irminism, Odinism, and Anglo-Saxon Heathenry&quot;.  In the [[Neopaganism in the UK|UK]], Germanic Neopaganism is more commonly known as [[Odinism]] or as ''Heathenry''.  This is mostly a matter of terminology, and US Asatru may be equated with UK Odinism for practical purposes, as is evident in the short-lived [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]] of folkish Asatru/Odinist groups.

==Terminology==
''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}'' is an [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (and equivalently [[Old Norse]]) term consisting of two parts. The first is ''{{lang|is|Ása}}-'', genitive of ''{{lang|is|Áss}}'', denoting one of the group of Norse heathen gods called {{lang|is|[[Æsir]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Zoega (1910): &quot;one of the old heathen gods in general, or especially one of the older branch, in opposition to the younger ones (the [[Vanir]])&quot;[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h037.php]&lt;/ref&gt; The second part, ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', means &quot;faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php Zoega (1910)]&lt;/ref&gt; (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' &quot;loyalty, honesty, good faith&quot;). Thus, ''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}'' means &quot;belief / faith in the Æsir / gods&quot;.

The term is the Old Norse/Icelandic translation of ''{{lang|sv|Asetro}}'', a [[neologism]] coined in the context of 19th century [[romantic nationalism]], used by [[Edvard Grieg]] in his 1870 opera ''[[Olaf Trygvason]]''. The use of the term ''Ásatrú'' for Germanic heathenism preceding 19th century revivalist movements is therefore an [[anachronism]].

''{{lang|is|Ásatrúarmaður}}'' (plural ''{{lang|is|Ásatrúarmenn}}''), the term used to identify those who practice Ásatrú is a compound with ''{{lang|is|maður}}'' (Old Norse ''{{lang|non|maðr}}'') &quot;man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Irrespective of sex. [http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h284.php], see [[Mannaz]].&lt;/ref&gt; In English usage, the genitive ''{{lang|is|Asatruar}}'' &quot;of Æsir faith&quot; is often used on its own to denote adherents (both singular and plural).

===Differences from Scandinavian and German usage===
There are two main strains Germanic Neopaganism known as ''Ásatrú'', originating near-simultaneously in Iceland (''{{lang|is|[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]}}'', 1972) and the USA ([[Asatru Free Assembly]], 1974). While the [[Neopaganism in Scandinavia|Scandinavian branch]] emphasizes [[pantheism|pantheist]] spirituality rooted in medieval and contemporary [[Scandinavian folklore]], the [[Neopaganism in the United States|American branch]] postulates a &quot;[[native religion]] of the peoples of [[Northern Europe]]&quot; reaching back into the [[paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Asatru reflects the deeper religiosity common to virtually all the nations of Europe.&quot; ([http://runestone.org/home.html Asatru Folk Assembly]); &quot; Ásatrú is thousands of years old. its beginnings are lost in prehistory, but as an organized system, it is older by far than Christianity. Strictly speaking, since Ásatrú is the religion which springs from the specific spiritual beliefs of the Northern Europeans, it is as old as this branch of the human race, which came into being 40,000 years ago.&quot; ([http://asatru.org/ Asatru Alliance])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neopaganism in Germany|In Germany]], the term ''Asatru'' is used in the wider sense of [[Germanic neopaganism]].

As ''Ásatrú'' implies a focus on polytheistic belief in the Æsir usage of the term in Scandinavia has declined somewhat. In Scandinavia, ''forn sed'' / ''forn siðr'' &quot;old custom&quot;, ''Nordisk sed'' &quot;Nordic custom&quot; or ''hedensk sed'' / ''heiðinn siður'' &quot;heathen custom&quot; are preferred.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We prefer to refer to our faith as 'den forna seden' (The Old Way) rather than Asatru.&quot; ([http://www.asatrosamfundet.se/ Sveriges Asatrosamfund])&lt;/ref&gt; In both the [[Anglosphere]] and [[German-speaking Europe]], it is widely used interchangeably with other terms for [[Germanic Neopaganism]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Germanic Spirituality&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author =Linzie, Bil| title =Germanic Spirituality| version =| publisher =| date =July 2003| url =http://www.northvegr.org/northern/book/spirituality.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate =February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are notable differences of emphasis between ''Ásatrú'' as practiced in the USA and in Scandinavia. According to Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), American Asatruar tend to prefer a more devotional form of worship and a more emotional conception of the Nordic gods than Scandinavian practitioner, reflecting the parallel tendency of highly emotional forms of Christianity prevalent in the United States .&lt;ref&gt;&quot;American Nordic Pagans want to feel an intimate relationship with their gods, not unlike evangelical attitudes towards Jesus. Icelandic Asatruar, by contrast, are more focused on devotion to their past cultural heritage rather than to particular gods.&quot; Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1970s, [[Stephen McNallen]], a former [[U.S. Army]] [[Airborne forces|Airborne]] [[U.S. Army Ranger|Ranger]], began publishing a newsletter titled ''The Runestone''. He also formed an organization called the ''Ásatrú Free Assembly'', which was later renamed the [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] which is still extant. [[Else Christensen|Else Christensen's]] ''[[Odinism]]'', which is sometimes identified with the term ''Ásatrú'', originated around the same period. 

In 1986, the &quot;[[folkish]] vs. [[universalist]]&quot; dispute and the dispute over the stance of Ásatrú towards [[white supremacism]] escalated, resulting in the breakup of the ''Asatru Free Assembly''. The universalist branch reformed as [[The Troth]], while the folkish branch became the [[Ásatrú Alliance]] (AA).
McNallen re-founded his own organisation as the  [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] (AFA) in 1994.

In 1997, the Britain based [[Odinic Rite]] (OR) founded a US chapter (ORV). This means that folkish Asatru is represented by three major organizations in the US, viz. AA, AFA and OR. The three groups have attempted to collaborate within an [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]] from 1997 to 2002, but was dissolved again in 2001 as a result of internal factional disputes.

''Ásatrú Alliance'', headed by Valgard Murray, publishes the &quot;Vor Tru&quot; newsletter. The ''Ásatrú Alliance'' held its 25th annual &quot;[[Althing]]&quot; gathering in 2005.&lt;ref name= &quot;AA Althing Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =Murray| first =Valgard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =AlThing 25 Report| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://asatru.org/Althingreport.html#top| doi =| accessdate =February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practice==
''Ásatrú'' groups and the individual ''Ásatrúarmenn'' have no standard means of practice.  

The US [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] defines it as &quot;an expression of the native, pre-Christian [[spirituality]] of Europe.&quot;

===Blót===
{{Main|Blót}}
Many Ásatrú groups celebrate with Blóts. Historically, the Blót was an event that focused on a communal sacrifice at various times of the year for a number of purposes. Families and extended family organizations would gather to participate in the communal event.

Modern blots are celebrated several times during the year. Ásatrú communities (kindreds, hearths, mots) have different approaches to the frequency of blots and their means of celebrating them.

===Sumbel===
{{Main|Sumbel}}
Besides the ''blot'', key among the ritual structures of Ásatrú as developed by [[Stephen McNallen|McNallen]] and [[Robert Stine|Stine]] is the ''[[sumbel]]'', a drinking-ritual in which a [[drinking horn]] full of mead or ale is passed around and a series of toasts are made, first to the [[Aesir]], then to other supernatural beings, then to heroes or ancestors, and then to others. Participants make also make boasts of their own deeds, or oaths or promises of future actions. Words spoken during the sumbel are considered and consecrated, becoming part of the destiny of those assembled.

===Goðar===
{{Main|Goði}}
A ''Goði'' or ''Gothi'' (plural ''goðar'') is the historical [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] term for a [[priest]] and [[tribal chief|chieftain]] in Norse paganism. ''Gyðja'' signifies a priestess. Goði literally means ''&quot;speaker for the gods&quot;'', and is used to denote the priesthood or those who officiate over rituals in Ásatrú. Several groups, most notably  [[the Troth]] have organized clergy programs.&lt;ref name=CLERGY&gt;Information regarding the Troth's clergy program can be found on their official website here: [http://www.thetroth.org/clergy/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no universal standard for the Goðar amongst organizations, and the title is usually only significant to the particular group with whom they work.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gothar&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =Murray| first =Valgard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Role of the Gothar in the Asatru Community| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://asatru.org/gothar.html| doi =| accessdate =February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindred===
{{Main|Kindred}}
A ''Kindred'' is a local worship group in Ásatrú. Other terms used are garth, [[stead]], ''sippe'', ''skeppslag'' and others. Kindreds are usually grassroots groups which may or may not be affiliated with a national organization like the ''Ásatrú Folk Assembly'', the ''Ásatrú Alliance'', or the ''Troth''. Kindreds are composed of [[hearth]]s or families as well as individuals, and the members of a Kindred may be related by blood or marriage, or may be unrelated. The kindred often functions as a combination of extended family and religious group. Membership is managed by the assent of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindred&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =Murray| first =Valgard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Asatru Kindred| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://asatru.org/thekinrd.html| doi =| accessdate =February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindreds usually have a recognized Goði to lead religious rites, while some other kindreds function more like modern corporations.  Although these Goði need only be recognized by the kindred itself and may not have any standing with any other Kindred.

==Related movements==
===Theodism===
''Theodism'', or ''Þéodisc Geléafa''  ([[Old English language|Old English]]: &quot;tribal belief&quot;) is thought by some to be a variant or sister movement of US Ásatrú.   Theodsmen themselves do not consider Theodism as a variant of Asatru and contend that the two religions are very different.&lt;ref&gt;http://gamall-steinn.org/theod/gl-theod-asatru.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/mossmuncher/Sweartfenn_Theod/articles/articles/asatruandtheodism.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''Theodism'' encompasses [[Normans|Norman]], [[Angles|Angle]], [[Saxon people|Continental Saxon]], [[Frisians|Frisian]], [[Jutes|Jutish]], [[Goths|Gothic]], [[Alamanni|Alemannic]], [[Swedish people|Swedish]], [[Danish people|Danish]] and other tribal variants. ''[[Þéodisc]]'' is the adjective of ''þéod'' &quot;people, tribe&quot;, cognate to ''[[:wikt:Dutch|Dutch]]''/''[[:wikt:deutsch|deutsch]]''.

While having some commonalities with the Ásatrú movement following McNallen, Theodism primarily derived its origins as a reaction to [[Wicca]]. In 1971, Garman Lord and other practitioners of Gardnerian Wicca founded the The Coven Witan of Anglo-Saxon Wicca.&lt;ref&gt;Garman Lord, &quot;The Evolution of Þéodisc Belief: Part I&quot; Theod Magazine, Lammas, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 
Theodism is focused on the lore, beliefs and social structure - particularly the concept of ''[[:wikt:thew|thew]]'' (Old English ''[[:wikt:þeaw|þeaw]]'') or &quot;customary law&quot; - of various specific Germanic tribes. The main distinction between Theodism and other modern manifestations of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] along with pre-Christian religions, the Theodish are also attempting to reconstruct aspects of pre-Christian Germanic social order (including [[Germanic king|sacral kingship]]). 
In general, Théodish religious festivities are referred to as 'fainings' (meaning 'celebration'). As a rule, there are two sorts of rituals; [[blót]] and [[symbel]]. [[Húsel]] is technically part of blót.&lt;ref&gt;Swain Wodening, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symbel]] is normally held after the feast, inasmuch as it is custom not to have food present.&lt;ref&gt;Garman Lord, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; 

Garman Lord formed the Witan Theod in [[Watertown, New York]], in 1976. A few years later, the Moody Hill Theod emerged as an offshoot of the Witan Theod.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Garman Lord, &quot;The Evolution of Þéodisc Belief: Part II&quot; Theod Magazine, Lammas, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1988 the Winland Rice was formed as an umbrella organization of Theodish groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Gert McQueen, Elder and Redesman of the [[The Troth|Ring of Troth]], was successful in lobbying the U.S. Army Chaplain’s Corps to adopt guidelines for recognizing heathen religions and Theodish belief in particular.  

The Winland Rice dissolved in 2002. In 2004, Garman Lord stated that the religion of Theodism does not work in practice, dissolving Gering Theod and declaring Theodism as defunct{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Several groups that have continued to call themselves Theodish. Axenthof Thiad originated in the early 1990s as the Fresena Thiad and part of the Winland Rice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axenthof.org&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Gerd Forsta Axenthoves changed the name to Axenthof Thiad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axenthof.org/aboutus.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Eric Wodening founded Englatheod in July 2007, while Sweartfenn Theod was founded, by Jeffrey Runokivi, in December 2007. Both groups practice Anglo-Saxon Theodism, and have members that have belonged to both the Winland Rice and the Ealdriht.&lt;ref&gt;http://swainblog.englatheod.org/?p=36&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the New Normannii Reik of Theodish Belief was founded in 1997 and is led by [[Dan Halloran]]&lt;ref name=Tanner2009&gt;{{Citation

===Fellowship of Anglo-Saxon Heathenry===
''The Fellowship of Anglo-Saxon Heathenry'' or '''Geferræden Fyrnsidu''' (GFS), is a  Germanic Neopagan organization founded in the USA in 2001. It serves as a &quot;church&quot; or church-like institution fostering the reconstructed religion of the pagan Anglo-Saxons, known as [[Fyrnsidu]]. 
The group's [http://www.fyrnsidu.org website] places itself in the &quot;tribalist&quot; category, taking  the term [[Anglo-Saxon]] as a linguistic or cultural rather than a racial concept.

==Politics and controversies==
Ásatrú organizations have memberships which span the entire political and spiritual spectrum. There is a history of political controversy within organized US Ásatrú, mostly surrounding the question of how to deal with such adherents as place themselves in a context of the [[far right]] and [[white supremacy]], notably resulting in the fragmentation of the ''[[Asatru Free Assembly]]'' in 1986.

Externally, political activity on the part of Ásatrú organizations has surrounded campaigns against alleged [[Religious discrimination against Neopagans|religious discrimination]], such as the call for the introduction of an Ásatrú &quot;emblem of  belief&quot;  by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] to parallel the Wiccan pentacle granted to the widow of [[Patrick Stewart (soldier)|Patrick Stewart]] in 2006.

===Folkish Asatru, Universalism and racialism===
{{See|Neo-völkisch_movements#Nordic_racial_paganism}}
{{See|Metagenetics}}
Some groups identifying as  Ásatrú have been associated with [[neo-Nazi]] and &quot;[[white power]]&quot; movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gods of the Blood&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first =Matthias | last =Gardell | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2003 | month = | title =Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =269–283 | publisher =Duke University Press | location = | isbn =0822330717 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Wotanism]] for more details)
This was notably an issue in the 1980s, when the [[Asatru Free Assembly]] disintegrated as a result of tensions between the racist and the non-racist factions{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

Today, the three largest US American ''Ásatrú'' organizations have specifically denounced any association with racist groups.&lt;ref&gt;'''From the ''[[Asatru Alliance]]'s'' Bylaws:''' &quot;The Alliance is apolitical; it is not a front for, nor shall it promote any political views of the 'Right' or 'Left'. Our Sacred temples, groves and Moots shall remain free of any political manifestations.&quot; [http://asatru.org/bylaws.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''From the ''[[Asatru Folk Assembly]]'s'' Bylaws:''' &quot;The belief that spirituality and ancestral heritage are related has nothing to do with notions of superiority. Ásatrú is not an excuse to look down on, much less to hate, members of any other race. On the contrary, we recognize the uniqueness and the value of all the different pieces that make up the human mosaic.&quot; [http://runestone.org/flash/home.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''From ''[[The Troth]]'s'' Bylaws:''' &quot;Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation shall not be practiced by the Troth or any affiliated group, whether in membership decisions or in conducting any of its activities.&quot; 

[http://www.thetroth.org/organization/bylaws.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A dividing issue is whether a person is &quot;Folkish&quot;, meaning that an emphasis on ancestry and ancestor worship is a part of their belief system.

--&gt;

===Discrimination charges===
{{See|Religious discrimination against Neopagans}}
Inmates of the &quot;Intensive Management Unit&quot;  at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] who are adherents of Ásatrú in 2001 were deprived of their [[Mjolnir|Thor's Hammer]] medallions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonerlife.com/articles/articleID=3.cfm Walla Walla's Suppression of Religious Freedom]{{Verify credibility|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Ásatrú adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor’s Hammer pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections after he was denied it while members of other religions were allowed their medallions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18629 First Amendment Center: Va. inmate can challenge denial of Thor's Hammer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs does not list any Ásatrú symbols as available [[USVA emblems for headstones and markers|emblems of belief for placement on government headstones and markers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hm/hmemb.asp Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers - Department of Veterans Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; According to federal guidelines, only approved religious symbols — of which there are 38 — can be placed on government headstones or memorial plaques. [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] have demanded such a symbol.

In the Georgacarakos v. Watts case Peter N. Georgacarakos filed a pro se civil-rights complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against 19 prison officials for &quot;interference with the free exercise of his Ásatrú religion&quot; and &quot;discrimination on the basis of his being Ásatrú&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kscourts.org/CA10/cases/2005/08/05-1180.htm Georgacarakos v. Watts]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ansible''' is a hypothetical machine capable of instantaneous or [[superluminal communication]]. Ansibles occur as [[plot device]]s in [[science fiction]] literature.

== Origin ==
The word ''ansible'' was [[neologism|coined]] by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] in her 1966 novel, ''[[Rocannon's World]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo, Susan M. &amp; Murphy, Graham J. ''Ursula K. Le Guin: A Critical Companion'', (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Guin states that she derived the name from &quot;answerable,&quot; as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over [[interstellar]] distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-ans1.htm|work=World Wide Words|title=Ansible|last=Quinion|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her award-winning [[1974]] [[novel]] ''[[The Dispossessed]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;dispossessed&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Le Guin | first = Ursula K. | authorlink = Ursula K.

'What is the ansible?' 'It's what he's calling an instantaneous communication device.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a book in the [[Hainish Cycle]], tells of the invention of the ansible.

== Usage ==
The name of the device has since been borrowed by authors such as [[Orson Scott Card]],&lt;ref name=&quot;egame&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Card | first = Orson Scott | authorlink = Orson Scott Card | title = [[Ender's Game]] | origyear = 1977 | origmonth = August | edition = mass ppb. | year = 1994 | month = July | publisher = [[Tor Books]] | location = New York | isbn = 0-8125-5070-6 | pages = 249 | quote = What matters is we built the ansible.

[[Anne McCaffery]]'s [[Crystal Singer]] series posited an instantaneous communication device powered by rare 'Black Crystal' from the planet Ballybran. Black Crystals cut from the same mineral deposit could be &quot;tuned&quot; to sympathetically vibrate with each other instantly, even when separated by interstellar distances, allowing instantaneous telephone-like voice and data communication. Similarly, in [[Gregory Keyes]]' series [[The Age of Unreason]], &quot;aetherschriebers&quot; use two halves of a single &quot;chime&quot; to communicate, aided by scientific alchemy. The series is set on an alternate 18th-century Earth. While the speed of communication is important, so is the fact that the messages cannot be overheard except by listeners with a piece of the original crystal.

[[Stephen R. Donaldson]], in his Gap Series, proposed a similar system, ''Symbiotic Crystalline Resonance Transmission'', clearly ansible-type technology, but was very difficult to produce and limited to text messages.

Some [[hard science fiction]] stories use small (possibly nano-sized) paired wormholes dedicated to communication by means of a laser which traverses the wormhole.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} 

[[Charles Stross]]'s books [[Singularity Sky]] and [[Iron Sunrise]] make use of &quot;causal channels&quot; which use entangled particles for instantaneous two-way communication. The technique has drawbacks in that the entangled particles are expendable and the use of faster-than-light travel destroys the entanglement, so that one end of the channel must be transported below light speed. This makes them expensive and limits their usefulness somewhat.

One ansible-like device which predates Le Guin's is the ''Dirac communicator'' in [[James Blish]]'s 1954 short story &quot;Beep&quot;. As the title implies, any active device received the sum of all transmitted messages in universal space-time, in a single pulse, so that demultiplexing yielded information about the past, present, and future.

[[Isaac Asimov]] solved the same communication problem with the ''hyper-wave relay'' in the [[The Foundation Series|Foundation series]]. 

Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate &quot;instantaneously&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;dispossessed&quot;/&gt; but other authors have adopted the name for devices only capable of finite-speed communication, although still faster than light. 

The ''subspace radio'', best known today from [[Star Trek]] and named for the method used in the series of achieving faster-than-light travel, was the most commonly used name for such a faster-than-light communicator in the science fiction of the 1930s to the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

In all the [[Stargate]] television series, characters are able to communicate instantaneously over long distances by transferring their consciousness into another person or being anywhere in the universe using &quot;[[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] communication stones&quot;. It is not known how these stones operate, but the technology explained in the show usually revolves around [[wormhole]]s for instant teleportation, faster-than-light, space-warping travel, and sometimes around [[quantum multiverse]]s.

=== In Le Guin's work ===

In ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one &quot;must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos.&quot; 

In ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the ansible &quot;doesn't involve [[radio]] waves, or any form of [[energy]]. The principle it works on, the constant of [[simultaneity]], is analogous in some ways to [[gravity]] ... One point has to be fixed, on a planet of certain mass, but the other end is portable.&quot; 

Unlike McCaffrey's black crystal transceivers, Le Guin's ansibles are not mated pairs: it is possible for an ansible's coordinates to be set to any known location of a receiving ansible. Moreover, the ansibles Le Guin uses in her stories apparently have a very limited [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session. Instead of a microphone and speaker, Le Guin's ansibles are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform [[text messaging]].

=== In Card's work ===
{{See also|Concepts in the Ender's Game series}}
[[Orson Scott Card]]'s [[Ender's Game series]] uses the ansible as a plot device. &quot;The official name is Philotic Parallax Instantaneous Communicator,&quot; explains [[Hyrum Graff|Colonel Graff]] in ''[[Ender's Game]]'', &quot;but somebody dredged the name ''ansible'' out of an old book somewhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;egame&quot;/&gt; 

Card's description of the ansible's functions in ''[[Xenocide]]'' involve a fictional subatomic particle, the [[Concepts in the Ender's Game series#Philote|philote]], and contradicts not only standard physical theory but also the results of empirical [[particle accelerator]] experiments. 

In the &quot;Enderverse&quot;, the two [[quark]]s inside a [[pion|pi meson]] can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by &quot;philotic rays&quot;. This concept is similar to [[quantum teleportation]] due to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], although even that does not imply a possibility of faster-than-light communication. Also, in the real world, [[quark confinement]] prevents quarks from being separated by more than microscopic distances.

The novels' treatment of [[time dilation]] is also inconsistent with standard theory. In the novels, the passenger of a starship experiences time compression, resulting in slowed speech when communicating over the ansible. This contradicts the core concept of the [[theory of relativity]] by giving the planet a privileged frame of reference. It is no more correct to say that the planet is at rest and the ship moving than to say that the ship is at rest and the planet moving backwards. As such, we find a paradox in which the person at each end of an ansible expects the other person to be time dilated and speaking slowly. In light speed or slower communications, this paradox is avoided due to the expected message delays, as in the [[Twin paradox]]. Instantaneous communications, however, does result in a paradox, as each communicator expected the other to be slowed.

The ansible is also feature of the video game [[Advent Rising]], for which Card helped write the story.

=== In reality ===
{{Main|Superluminal communication}}
There is no currently known way to build an ansible. The theory of [[special relativity]] predicts that any such device would allow communication from the future to the past, which raises problems of [[causality]], unless the device used general relativistic curved spacetimes as an integral part.

[[Quantum nonlocality]] is often proposed as a mechanism for superluminal communication&lt;ref name=&quot;amber&quot;/&gt;. A 2008 [[quantum physics]] experiment performed in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] has determined that in any hypothetical [[Hidden_variable_theory#Non-local_hidden-variable_theory|nonlocal hidden-variables theory]] the speed of the ''quantum non-local connection'' would have to be at least 10,000 times the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3316 Testing ''Spooky Action at a Distance'' Preprint:]  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7206/full/nature07121.html Testing ''Spooky Action at a Distance'' Nature Article]&lt;/ref&gt; Practical applications are made impossible due to the [[no-cloning theorem]], and the fact that quantum field theories preserve causality, so that quantum correlations cannot be used to transfer information.

Nevertheless, consider the EPR thought experiment, and suppose [[quantum states]] could be [[cloned]]. Assume parts of a maximally entangled Bell state are distributed to Alice and Bob. Alice could send bits to Bob in the following way: If Alice wishes to transmit a &quot;0&quot;, she measures the spin of her electron in the z direction, collapsing Bob's state to either |z+&gt; or |z-&gt;. To transmit &quot;1&quot;, Alice does nothing to her electron. Bob creates many copies of his electron's state, and measures the spin of each copy in the z direction. Bob will know that Alice has transmitted a &quot;0&quot; if all his measurements produce the same result; otherwise, his measurements will have outcomes +1/2 and −1/2 with equal probability. This would allow Alice and Bob to communicate across [[space-like]] separations.

See [[time travel]] and [[faster-than-light]] for more discussion of these issues.

'''Saint Adalbert''', [[Czech language|Czech]]: {{Audio|Cs-svaty_Vojtech.ogg|''Vojtěch''}}; {{lang-pl|Wojciech}}, (c. 956 &amp;ndash; April 23, 997), a [[bishop of Prague]] and a [[missionary]], was martyred in his efforts to convert the [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]. He was later made the [[patron saint]] of [[Bohemia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]].

==Birth and youth==
Adalbert (''Vojtěch'', ''Vjačeslav'') was born into a noble Czech family of Prince [[Slavník]] and his wife [[Střezislava]] in [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], Bohemia. The [[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]] mistakenly gives his year of birth as 939.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Biographical Dictionary, ISBN 0-550-16010-8, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was a rich and independent ruler of the [[Zlicans|Zličan]] princedom that rivaled Prague (see [[Slavník's dynasty]]). Adalbert had five full brothers: [[Soběslav (d. 1004)|Soběslav]] (Slavnik's heir), Spytimír, Pobraslav, Pořej, Čáslav and a half-brother [[Radim Gaudentius|Radim (Gaudentius)]] from his father's liaison with another woman. Radim chose a clerical career as did Adalbert, and took the name Gaudentius. Adalbert was a well-educated man, having studied for about ten years (970-80) in [[Magdeburg]] under Saint [[Adalbert of Magdeburg]]. Upon the death of his mentor, he took the name Adalbert. Gifted and industrious, Adalbert soon became well-known all over Europe.

==Religious acts==
In 980 Adalbert finished his studies at Magdeburg school and returned to Prague, where he became a priest. In 981 his father, Prince Slavnik, and both his mentors died.[[File:Sanctus Adalbertus.jpg|thumb|right| Saint Adalbert.]] In 982, still not yet thirty years old, Adalbert became the [[Bishop of Prague]]. Although Adalbert descended from a rich family and could afford comfort and luxury, he lived poorly of his own free will. He was noted for charity, austerity, and zealous service to the Church. His duty was difficult even in baptized Bohemia, as the pagan creed was deeply embedded in the peoples' minds. Adalbert complained of polygamy and idolatry, which still were not unusual among the Czechs.  He also strongly resented the participation of baptized Christians in the [[slavery|slave]] trade.

In 989 he resigned from his bishop's cloth and left Prague. He went to Rome and lived as a hermit in St. Alexis Benedictine monastery.

Four years later, in 993, [[Pope John XV]] sent him back to Bohemia. Adalbert became the Bishop again. That time he founded a [[Brevnov Monastery|monastery in Břevnov]], near Prague, the first one in the Czech lands. Nonetheless, the nobility there continued to oppose his ministry. Also, according to Cosmas' chronicle, high clerical office was a burden to Adalbert, and in 994 he offered it to [[Strachkvas]] who was Přemyslid and Duke Boleslav's brother. Strachkvas, nevertheless, refused.

[[File:Bishopcoa.png|100px|left]]

In 995 Slavniks' former rivalry with the [[Přemyslids]] (allied with [[Vršovci]]) resulted in the storming of Libice led by [[Boleslaus II the Pious]]. During the struggle four (or five) of Adalbert's brothers were murdered. Thus the Zličan princedom became part of the Přemyslids' estate.

Adalbert damned the murderers{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}(Vršovci) in church and, according to the legend, predicted that Vršovci would be severely persecuted. After the tragedy he could not stay in Bohemia and escaped from Prague, despite the Pope's call for him to return to his episcopal see. Strachkvas was eventually appointed to be his successor. However, when he was going to assume the Bishop office in Prague, he suddenly died during the ceremony itself. Circumstances of his death are still unclear.

As for Adalbert, he went to [[Hungary]] and baptized [[Géza of Hungary]] and his son [[Stephen of Hungary|Stephen]] in the city of [[Esztergom]]. Then he went to Poland where he was cordially welcomed by Bolesław I the Brave. After the short visit Adalbert went to Prussia with a Christian mission.

==Mission and martyrdom in Prussia==
[[File:Adalb.jpg|right|frame|Saint Adalbert being killed by [[Prussians]], part of [[Gniezno Doors]]]]

Adalbert of Prague had already in 977 entertained the idea of becoming a [[missionary]] in [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]]. After he had converted Hungary, he was sent by the Pope to convert the heathen [[Prussians]].  [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]], duke of Poland (later king), sent [[soldiers]] with Adalbert. The bishop and his followers - including his half-brother Radim (Gaudentius) - entered Prussian territory and went along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast to [[Gdańsk]].

It was a standard procedure of Christian missionaries to try to chop down [[Sacred grove|sacred oak trees]], which they had done in many other places, including [[Saxony]]. Because the trees were worshipped and the spirits who were believed to inhabit the trees were feared for their powers, this was done to demonstrate to the non-Christians that no supernatural powers protected the trees from the Christians. (See: [[Iconoclasm]])

When they did not heed warnings to stay away from the sacred oak groves, Adalbert was executed for sacrilege, which his co-religionists interpreted as [[martyr]]dom, in April 997 on the Baltic Sea coast east of [[Truso]] (currently [[Elbląg]], Elbing), or near [[Tenkitten]] and [[Fischhausen]] (see external link map St. Albrecht) It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in [[gold]] by Boleslaus the Brave.

==Canonization and memory==
[[File:Socha Svateho Vojtecha a Radima.jpg|right|thumb|150px|St. Adalbert (Vojtěch) and his brother Gaudentius (Radim) monument in [[Libice nad Cidlinou|Libice]] (Czech Republic)]]
[[File:Relikwiarz Swietego Wojciecha.JPG|thumb|left|Silver coffin of St. Wojciech (Cathedral in [[Gniezno]])]]
A few years later Adalbert was [[canonization|canonized]] as '''Saint Adalbert of Prague.''' His life has been written about in ''[[Vita Sancti Adalberti]] Pragensis'' by various writers, the earliest being traced to imperial [[Aachen]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège/Lüttich]]'s bishop [[Notger von Lüttich]], although it was assumed for many years that the [[Rome|Roman]] monk [[John Canaparius]] wrote the first ''Vita'' in 999. Another famous biographer of Adalbert was Saint [[Bruno of Querfurt]] who wrote his hagiography in 1001–1004.

Notably, Bohemian rulers (i.e., Přemyslids) initially refused to ransom Saint Adalbert's body from the Prussians who murdered him, so it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by Saint Adalbert's belonging to the Slavniks family; it highlights the strength of the two clans' conflict. Thus Saint Adalbert's bones were stored in Gniezno and helped Boleslaus the Brave to improve Poland's position in Europe.

According to Bohemian accounts, in 1039 the Bohemian duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Břetislav I]] looted the bones of Saint Adalbert from Gniezno in a raid and moved them to Prague.  According to Polish accounts he took the wrong relics, those of St Gaudensius, while Saint Adalbert's relics were hidden by the Poles and remain in Gniezo. In 1127 the decapitated head, which was not in the original purchase (according to ''Roczniki Polskie'') was found and moved to Gniezno. In 1928, one of the arms of Saint Adalbert, which Bolesław I had given to [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in the year 1000, was added to the bones preserved in Gniezno. Today Saint Adalbert has two elaborate shrines claiming to contain his remains, in the cathedrals of Prague and Gniezno, and which bones are authentic is not clear. For example, the saint has two skulls - one in Prague, a second in Gniezno (stolen in 1923).

The massive bronze [[Gniezno Doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]], of about 1175, are decorated with 18 [[relief]]s of scenes from the saint's life, the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] church doors in Europe to contain a cycle illustrating the life of a saint.

April 1997 was the thousandth anniversary of Saint Adalbert's martyrdom. It was commemorated in the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Russia and other countries. Representatives of Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Evangelical churches pilgrimaged to Gniezno, to the saint's tomb. [[John Paul II]] visited Gniezno and held a ceremonial divine service in which heads of seven European states and about a million believers took part.

In [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], near [[Beregovoe]] village (former [[Tenkitten]]), where Adalbert's death hypothetically took place, a ten-meter cross was established.

'''Ælfheah''' ({{lang-ang|Ælfhēah}}, &quot;elf-high&quot;; 954 – 19 April 1012), officially remembered by the name '''Alphege''' within the Church, and also called '''Elphege''', '''Alfege''', or '''Godwine''', was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Bishop of Winchester]], later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He became an [[anchorite]] before being elected abbot of [[Bath Abbey]]. His perceived piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the [[episcopate]], and eventually, to his becoming archbishop. Ælfheah furthered the cult of [[Dunstan]] and also encouraged learning. He was captured by [[Viking]] raiders in 1011 and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed. Ælfheah was [[Canonization|canonized]] as a [[saint]] in 1078. [[Thomas Becket]], a later Archbishop of Canterbury, prayed to him just before his own murder in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].

==Life==
Reportedly born in [[Weston, Bath|Weston]] on the outskirts of Bath,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintalphege.org.uk/4saint.html |title=Alphege, Saint and Martyr |publisher=St. Alphege's Church, Bath}} Accessed 14 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ælfheah became a monk early in life. He first entered the monastery of [[Deerhurst]], but then moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become [[abbot]] of Bath Abbey.&lt;ref name=Knowles&gt;Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses, England and Wales'' pp. 28, 241&lt;/ref&gt; Probably due to the influence of [[Dunstan]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Ælfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984,&lt;ref name=Handbook223&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1000Church109&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 109 footnote 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was consecrated on 19&amp;nbsp;October that year.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; While bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of a large [[Pipe organ|organ]] in the [[Old Minster, Winchester|cathedral]], audible from over a mile (1600&amp;nbsp;m) away and said to require more than 24&amp;nbsp;men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches,&lt;ref name=Hindley304&gt;Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 304–305&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted the cult of [[Swithun]] and Swithun's predecessor, [[Æthelwold of Winchester]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Following a Viking raid in 994, a peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders, [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]]. Besides receiving [[danegeld]], Olaf converted to Christianity&lt;ref name=ASE378&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; and undertook never to raid or fight the English again.&lt;ref name=Williams47&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Ælfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Leyser &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/181 Ælfheah (d. 1012)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded [[Ælfric of Abingdon|Ælfric]] as Archbishop of Canterbury,&lt;ref name=Saints&gt;Walsh ''A New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook214&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; taking Swithun's head with him as a [[relic]] for the new location.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his [[pallium]]—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope [[Pope John XVIII|John XVIII]], but was robbed during his journey.&lt;ref name=1000Church299&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' pp. 298–299 footnote 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenig &quot;Bonds of Wool&quot; ''America: The National Catholic Weekly'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; While at Canterbury he promoted the cult of Dunstan,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; ordering the writing of the second ''Life of Dunstan'', which Adelard composed between 1006 and 1011.&lt;ref name=1000Church62&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the [[Witenagemot]]'s recognition of [[Wulfsige III|Wulfsige of Sherborne]] as a saint in about 1012.&lt;ref name=1000Church223&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Ælfheah sent [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] to [[Cerne Abbey]] to take charge of its monastic school.&lt;ref name=ASE458&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; He was present at the council of May 1008 at which [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York]], preached his ''[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]'' (''The Sermon of the Wolf to the English''), castigating the English for their moral failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.&lt;ref name=Fletcher94&gt;Fletcher ''Bloodfeud'' p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1011 the [[Viking|Danes]] again raided England, and from 8–29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of Ælfmaer, whose life Ælfheah had once saved, the raiders succeeded in sacking the city.&lt;ref name=Williams106&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|How exactly Ælfheah had saved Ælfmaer's life is not recorded in any source.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;|group=notes}} Ælfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months.&lt;ref name=Hindley301&gt;Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; [[Godwine I|Godwine]] ([[Bishop of Rochester]]), [[Leofrun]] (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's [[Reeve (England)|reeve]], Ælfweard were captured also, but the abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[Ælfmaer]], managed to escape.&lt;ref name=Williams106/&gt; Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by the Danes following Ælfheah's capture.&lt;ref name=1000Church209&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ælfheah refused to allow a ransom to be paid for his freedom, and as a result was killed on 19&amp;nbsp;April 1012 at [[Greenwich]]&lt;ref name=Hindley301/&gt; (then in [[Kent]], now part of London), reputedly on the site of [[St Alfege Church, Greenwich|St Alfege's Church]].&lt;ref name=Saints/&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook214/&gt; The account of Ælfheah's death appears in the E version of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'': {{quote|... the raiding-army became much stirred up against the bishop, because he did not want to offer them any money, and forbade that anything might be granted in return for him. Also they were very drunk, because there was wine brought from the south. Then they seized the bishop, led him to their &quot;hustings&quot;{{#tag:ref|&quot;Hustings&quot; derives from an Old Norse word that has the meaning of assembly or council, so there may have been some sort of trial that condemned Ælfheah.&lt;ref name=ASC/&gt;|group=notes}} on the Saturday in the octave of Easter, and then pelted him there with bones and the heads of cattle; and one of them struck him on the head with the butt of an axe, so that with the blow he sank down and his holy blood fell on the earth, and sent forth his holy soul to God's kingdom.&lt;ref name=ASC&gt;Swanton ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ælfheah was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to die a violent death.&lt;ref name=Fletcher78&gt;Fletcher ''Bloodfeud'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary report tells that [[Thorkell the Tall]] attempted to save Ælfheah from the mob about to kill him by offering them everything he owned except for his ship, in exchange for Ælfheah's life; Thorkell's presence is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, however.&lt;ref name=Williams109&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources record that the final blow, with the back of an axe, was delivered as an [[Coup de grâce|act of kindness]] by a Christian convert known as &quot;Thrum.&quot; Ælfheah was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1023 his body was moved by King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] to [[Canterbury]], with great ceremony.&lt;ref name=Hindley309&gt;Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; Thorkell the Tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders, and switched sides to the English king [[Æthelred the Unready]] following Ælfheah's death.&lt;ref name=ASE383&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] canonized Ælfheah in 1078, with a [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of 19&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref name=DictSaint&gt;Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lanfranc]], the first [[Norman conquest of England|post-conquest]] archbishop, was dubious about some of the saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of Ælfheah's sanctity,&lt;ref name=Conquest137&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; but Ælfheah and [[Augustine of Canterbury]] were the only pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's calendar of saints.&lt;ref name=ASE672&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 672&lt;/ref&gt; Ælfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early 12th century under [[Anselm of Canterbury]], who was instrumental in retaining Ælfheah's name in the church calendar.&lt;ref name=PopularReligion40&gt;Brooke ''Popular Religion in the Middle Ages'' p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern &quot;St Anselm and his English Pupils&quot; ''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1174 fire in Canterbury Cathedral, Ælfheah's remains together with those of Dunstan were placed around the high altar, at which Thomas Becket is said to have commended his life into Ælfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom during the [[Becket controversy]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The new shrine was sealed in lead,&lt;ref name=Shrines33&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and was north of the high altar, sharing the honour with Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the high altar.&lt;ref name=Shrines66&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Life of Saint Ælfheah'' in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named [[Osbern of Canterbury|Osbern]], at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but the ''Life'' is very much a [[hagiography]]: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In the late medieval period, Ælfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, perhaps because of the saint's connection with Cnut.&lt;ref name=Blair504&gt;Blair &quot;Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints&quot; ''Local Saints and Local Churches'' p. 504&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 a new church in Bath was dedicated to Saint Ælfheah, designed by [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] in homage to the ancient Roman church of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintalphege.org.uk/2building.html |title=St Alphege's Church: The Building |publisher=St Alphege's Church, Bath }} Accessed 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|a particular kind of [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra over a commutative ring]]|other uses of the term &quot;algebra&quot;|algebra (disambiguation)}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''associative algebra''' ''A'' is an [[ring (mathematics)|associative ring]] that has a compatible structure of a vector space over a certain [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' or, more generally, of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[commutative ring]] ''R''. Thus ''A'' is endowed with binary operations of addition and multiplication satisfying a number of axioms, including  [[associativity]] of multiplication and [[distributivity]], as well as compatible multiplication by the elements of the field ''K'' or the ring ''R''.

In some areas of mathematics, associative algebras are typically assumed to have a multiplicative unit, denoted 1. To make this extra assumption clear, these associative algebras are called [[unital algebra]]s.

==Formal definition==
Let ''R'' be a fixed [[commutative ring]]. An '''associative ''R''-algebra''' is an additive [[abelian group]] ''A'' which has the structure of both a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] in such a way that ring multiplication is [[bilinear map|''R''-bilinear]]:
:&lt;math&gt;r\cdot(xy) = (r\cdot x)y = x(r\cdot y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''r'' ∈ ''R'' and ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A''.
We say ''A'' is '''unital''' if it contains an element 1 such that
:&lt;math&gt;1 x = x = x 1 &lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' ∈ ''A''.

If ''A'' itself is commutative (as a ring) then it is called a '''commutative ''R''-algebra'''.

===From ''R''-modules===
Starting with an ''R''-module ''A'', we get an associative ''R''-algebra by equipping ''A'' with an ''R''-bilinear mapping ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' → ''A'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;x(yz) = (xy)z\,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''A''. This ''R''-bilinear mapping then gives ''A'' the structure of a ring and an associative ''R''-algebra.  Every associative ''R''-algebra arises this way.

Moreover, the algebra ''A'' built this way will be unital if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\exists 1\in A,\; 1x = x1 = x&lt;/math&gt;
This definition is equivalent to the statement that a unital associative ''R''-algebra is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in '''''R''-Mod''' (the [[monoidal category]] of ''R''-modules).

===From rings===
Starting with a ring ''A'', we get a unital associative ''R''-algebra by providing a [[ring homomorphism]]   &lt;math&gt;\eta\colon R \to A&lt;/math&gt; whose image lies in the [[center (algebra)|center]] of ''A''. The algebra ''A'' can then be thought of as an  ''R''-module by defining
:&lt;math&gt;r\cdot x = \eta(r)x&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''r'' ∈ ''R'' and ''x'' ∈ ''A''.

If ''A'' is commutative then the center of ''A'' is equal to ''A'', so that a commutative ''R''-algebra can be defined simply as a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\eta\colon R \to A&lt;/math&gt; of commutative rings.

==Algebra homomorphisms==
A [[homomorphism]] between two associative ''R''-algebras is an ''R''-linear [[ring homomorphism]]. Explicitly, &lt;math&gt;\phi : A_1 \to A_2&lt;/math&gt; is an '''associative algebra homomorphism''' if
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(r\cdot x) = r\cdot \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x+y) = \phi(x)+\phi(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;
For a homomorphism of ''unital'' associative ''R''-algebras, we also demand that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(1) = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

The class of all unital associative ''R''-algebras together with algebra homomorphisms between them form a [[category (mathematics)|category]], sometimes denoted '''''R''-Alg'''.

The [[subcategory]] of commutative ''R''-algebras can be characterized as the [[coslice category]] ''R''/'''CRing''' where '''CRing''' is the [[category of commutative rings]].

==Examples==
* The square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from the field ''K'' form a unitary associative algebra over ''K''.
* The [[complex number]]s form a 2-dimensional unitary associative algebra over the [[real number]]s.
* The [[quaternions]] form a 4-dimensional unitary associative algebra over the reals (but not an algebra over the complex numbers, since if complex numbers are treated as a subset of the quaternions, complex numbers and quaternions do not commute).
* The [[2 &amp;times; 2 real matrices]] form an associative algebra useful in plane mapping.
* The [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients form a unitary associative algebra over the reals.
* Given any [[Banach space]] ''X'', the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear operator]]s ''A'' : ''X'' → ''X'' form a unitary associative algebra (using composition of operators as multiplication); this is a [[Banach algebra]].
* Given any [[topology|topological space]] ''X'', the continuous real- or complex-valued functions on ''X'' form a real or complex unitary associative algebra; here the functions are added and multiplied pointwise.
* An example of a non-unitary associative algebra is given by the set of all functions ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' whose [[limit of a function|limit]] as ''x'' nears infinity is zero.
* The [[Clifford algebra]]s are useful in [[geometry]] and [[physics]].
* [[Incidence algebra]]s of locally finite [[partially ordered set]]s are unitary associative algebras considered in [[combinatorics]].
*Any ring ''A'' can be considered as a '''Z'''-algebra in a unique way. The unique ring homomorphism from '''Z''' to ''A'' is determined by the fact that it must send 1 to the identity in ''A''. Therefore rings and '''Z'''-algebras are equivalent concepts, in the same way that [[abelian group]]s and '''Z'''-modules are equivalent.
*Any ring of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''n'' is a ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')-algebra in the same way.
*Any ring ''A'' is an algebra over its [[center (algebra)|center]] ''Z''(''A''), or over any subring of its center.
*Any commutative ring ''R'' is an algebra over itself, or any subring of ''R''.
*Given an ''R''-module ''M'', the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''M'', denoted End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is an ''R''-algebra by defining (''r''·φ)(''x'') = ''r''·φ(''x'').
*Any ring of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with coefficients in a commutative ring ''R'' forms an ''R''-algebra under matrix addition and multiplication. This coincides with the previous example when ''M'' is a finitely-generated, [[free module|free]] ''R''-module.
*Every [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is a commutative ''R''-algebra. In fact, this is the free commutative ''R''-algebra on the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}.
*The [[free algebra|free ''R''-algebra]] on a set ''E'' is an algebra of polynomials with coefficients in ''R'' and noncommuting indeterminates taken from the set ''E''.
*The [[tensor algebra]] of an ''R''-module is naturally an ''R''-algebra. The same is true for quotients such as the [[exterior algebra|exterior]] and [[symmetric algebra]]s. Categorically speaking, the [[functor]] which maps an ''R''-module to its tensor algebra is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ''R''-module (forgetting the ring structure).
* Given a commutative ring ''R'' and any ring ''A'' the [[tensor product of rings|tensor product]] ''R''⊗&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' can be given the structure of an ''R''-algebra by defining ''r''·(''s''⊗''a'') = (''rs''⊗''a''). The functor which sends ''A'' to ''R''⊗&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ring (forgetting the module structure).

==Constructions==
;Subalgebras: A subalgebra of an ''R''-algebra ''A'' is a subset of ''A'' which is both a [[subring]] and a [[submodule]] of ''A''. That is, it must be closed under addition, ring multiplication, scalar multiplication, and it must contain the identity element of ''A''.
;Quotient algebras: Let ''A'' be an ''R''-algebra. Any ring-theoretic [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' in ''A'' is automatically an ''R''-module since ''r''·''x'' = (''r''1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''. This gives the [[quotient ring]] ''A''/''I'' the structure of an ''R''-module and, in fact, an ''R''-algebra. It follows that any ring homomorphic image of ''A'' is also an ''R''-algebra.
;Direct products: The direct product of a family of ''R''-algebras is the ring-theoretic direct product. This becomes an ''R''-algebra with the obvious scalar multiplication.
;Free products: One can form a [[free product]] of ''R''-algebras in a manner similar to the free product of groups. The free product is the [[coproduct]] in the category of ''R''-algebras.
;Tensor products: The tensor product of two ''R''-algebras is also an ''R''-algebra in a natural way. See [[tensor product of algebras]] for more details.

==Associativity and the multiplication mapping==
Associativity was defined above quantifying over all ''elements'' of ''A''. It is possible to define associativity in a way that does not explicitly refer to elements.  An algebra is defined as a map ''M'' (multiplication) on a vector space ''A'':
:&lt;math&gt;M: A \times A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
An associative algebra is an algebra where the map ''M'' has the property
:&lt;math&gt;M \circ (\mbox {Id} \times M) = M \circ (M \times \mbox {Id})&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; refers to [[function composition]], and Id&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''A'' is the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''A''.

To see the equivalence of the definitions, we need only understand that each side of the above equation is a function that takes three arguments. For example, the left-hand side acts as
:&lt;math&gt;( M \circ (\mbox {Id} \times M)) (x,y,z) = M (x, M(y,z))&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a unital associative algebra can be defined in terms of a unit map
:&lt;math&gt;\eta: K \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
which has the property
:&lt;math&gt;M \circ (\mbox {Id} \times \eta ) = s = M \circ (\eta \times \mbox {Id})&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the unit map η takes an element ''k'' in ''K'' to the element ''k1'' in ''A'', where ''1'' is the unit element of ''A''.  The map ''s'' is just plain-old scalar multiplication: &lt;math&gt;s:K\times A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;; thus, the above identity is sometimes written with Id standing in the place of ''s'', with scalar multiplication being implicitly understood.

==Coalgebras==
An associative unitary algebra over ''K'' is based on a [[morphism]] ''A''&amp;times;''A''→''A'' having 2 inputs (multiplicator and multiplicand) and one output (product), as well as a morphism ''K''→''A'' identifying the scalar multiples of the multiplicative identity. These two morphisms can be dualized using [[categorial duality]] by reversing all arrows in the [[commutative diagram]]s which describe the algebra [[axiom]]s; this defines the structure of a [[coalgebra]].

There is also an abstract notion of [[F-coalgebra]].

==Representations==
A [[representation theory|representation]] of an algebra is a linear map ρ: ''A'' → gl(''V'') from ''A'' to the general linear algebra of some vector space (or module) ''V'' that preserves the multiplicative operation: that is, ρ(''xy'')=ρ(''x'')ρ(''y'').

Note, however, that there is no natural way of defining a [[tensor product]] of representations of associative algebras, without somehow imposing additional conditions.   Here, by ''tensor product of representations'',  the usual meaning is intended: the result should be a linear representation on the product vector space. Imposing such additional structure typically leads to the idea of a [[Hopf algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]], as demonstrated below.

===Motivation for a Hopf algebra===
Consider, for example, two representations &lt;math&gt;\sigma:A\rightarrow gl(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau:A\rightarrow gl(W)&lt;/math&gt;.  One might try to form a tensor product representation &lt;math&gt;\rho: x \mapsto \sigma(x) \otimes \tau(x)&lt;/math&gt; according to how it acts on the product vector space, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x)(v \otimes w) = (\sigma(x)(v)) \otimes (\tau(x)(w)).&lt;/math&gt;

However, such a map would not be linear, since one would have

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(kx) = \sigma(kx) \otimes \tau(kx) = k\sigma(x) \otimes k\tau(x) = k^2 (\sigma(x) \otimes \tau(x)) = k^2 \rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' ∈ ''K''. One can rescue this attempt and restore linearity by imposing additional structure, by defining a map Δ: ''A'' → ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'', and defining the tensor product representation as

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = (\sigma\otimes \tau) \circ \Delta.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, Δ is a [[comultiplication]].  The resulting structure is called a [[bialgebra]].  To be consistent with the definitions of the associative algebra, the coalgebra must be co-associative, and, if the algebra is unital, then the co-algebra must be unital as well.  Note that bialgebras leave  multiplication and co-multiplication unrelated; thus it is common to relate the two (by defining an antipode), thus creating a [[Hopf algebra]].

===Motivation for a Lie algebra===
One can try to be more clever in defining a tensor product. Consider, for example,

:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \rho (x) = \sigma(x) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x)&lt;/math&gt;

so that the action on the tensor product space is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x) (v \otimes w) = (\sigma(x) v)\otimes w + v \otimes (\tau(x) w) &lt;/math&gt;.

This map is clearly linear in ''x'', and so it does not have the problem of the earlier definition.  However, it fails to preserve multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(xy) = \sigma(x) \sigma(y) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x) \tau(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

But, in general, this does not equal

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x)\rho(y) = \sigma(x) \sigma(y) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \sigma(x) \otimes \tau(y) + \sigma(y) \otimes \tau(x) + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x) \tau(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Equality would hold if the product ''xy'' were antisymmetric (if the product were the [[Lie bracket]], that is, &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv M(x,y) = [x,y]&lt;/math&gt;), thus turning the associative algebra into a [[Lie algebra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In mathematics, the '''axiom of regularity''' (also known as the '''axiom of foundation''') is one of the axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] and was introduced by  {{harvtxt|von Neumann|1925}}.  In [[first-order logic]] the axiom reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A (\exists B (B \in A)  \Rightarrow \exists B (B \in A \land \lnot \exist C (C \in A \land C \in B))).&lt;/math&gt;

Or in prose:
:Every non-empty [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' contains an element ''B'' which is disjoint from ''A''.

Two results which follow from the axiom are that &quot;no set is an element of itself,&quot; and that &quot;there is no infinite [[sequence]] (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') such that ''a&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an element of ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i''.&quot;

With the [[axiom of dependent choice]] (which is a weakened form of the [[axiom of choice]]), this result can be reversed: if there are no such infinite sequences, then the axiom of regularity is true. Hence, the axiom of regularity is equivalent, given the axiom of dependent choice, to the alternative axiom that there are no downward infinite membership chains.

The axiom of regularity is arguably the least useful ingredient of  [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]], since virtually all results in the branches of mathematics based on set theory hold even in the absence of regularity (see chapter 3 of {{harvtxt|Kunen|1980}}).  However, it is used extensively in establishing results about [[well-ordering]] and the [[ordinal number|ordinals]] in general. In addition to omitting the axiom of regularity, [[Non-well-founded set theory|non-standard set theories]] have indeed postulated the existence of sets that are elements of themselves.

Given the other [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] axioms, the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the [[epsilon-induction|axiom of induction]].

== Elementary implications of Regularity==
===No set is an element of itself===
Let ''A'' be a set such that ''A'' is an element of itself and define ''B'' = {''A''}, which is a set by the [[axiom of pairing]]. Applying the axiom of regularity to ''B'', we see that the only element of ''B'', namely, ''A'', must be disjoint from ''B''. But ''A'' is both an element of itself and an element of ''B''. Thus ''B'' does not satisfy the axiom of regularity and we have a contradiction, proving that ''A'' cannot exist.

===No infinite descending sequence of sets exists===
Suppose, to the contrary, that there is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''f'', on the [[natural number]]s with ''f''(''n''+1) an element of ''f''(''n'') for each ''n''. Define ''S'' = {''f''(''n''): ''n'' a natural number}, the range of ''f'', which can be seen to be a set from the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. Applying the axiom of regularity to ''S'', let ''B'' be an element of ''S'' which is disjoint from ''S''. By the definition of ''S'', ''B'' must be ''f''(''k'') for some natural number ''k''. However, we are given that ''f''(''k'') contains ''f''(''k''+1) which is also an element of ''S''. So ''f''(''k''+1) is in the intersection of ''f''(''k'') and ''S''. This contradicts the fact that they are disjoint sets. Since our supposition led to a contradiction, there must not be any such function, ''f''.

The nonexistence of a set containing itself can be seen as a special case where the sequence is infinite and constant.

Notice that this argument only applies to functions ''f'' which can be represented as sets as opposed to undefinable classes. The [[hereditarily finite set]]s, V&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, satisfy the axiom of regularity (and all other axioms of [[ZFC]] except the [[axiom of infinity]]). So if one forms a non-trivial [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] of V&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, then it will also satisfy the axiom of regularity. The resulting [[model (logic)|model]] &lt;!--WHAT model?--&gt; will contain elements, called non-standard natural numbers, which satisfy the definition of natural numbers in that model but are not really natural numbers. They are fake natural numbers which are &quot;larger&quot; than any actual natural number. This model will contain infinite descending sequences of elements. For example, suppose ''n'' is a non-standard natural number, then &lt;math&gt;(n-1) \in n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(n-2) \in (n-1)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. For any actual natural number ''k'', &lt;math&gt;(n-k-1) \in (n-k)&lt;/math&gt;. This is an unending descending sequence of elements. But this sequence is not definable in the model and thus not a set.  So no contradiction to regularity can be proved.

===Simpler set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair===
The axiom of regularity enables defining the ordered pair (''a'',''b'') as {''a'',{''a'',''b''}}. See [[ordered pair]] for specifics. This definition eliminates one pair of braces from the canonical [[Kuratowski]] definition (''a'',''b'') = {{''a''},{''a'',''b''}}.

=== Every set has an ordinal rank ===
This was actually the original form of von Neumann's axiomatization.  The concept of the rank of a set had also been examined by Mirimanoff {{harvtxt|Mirimanoff|1917}}, but that work did not consider the axiom &quot;every set has a rank&quot; nor the consequences of such an axiom (see {{harvtxt|Jech|2003}}).

==The axiom of dependent choice and no infinite descending sequence of sets implies Regularity==
Let the non-empty set ''S'' be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, every element of ''S'' has a non-empty intersection with ''S''. We define a binary relation ''R'' on ''S'' by &lt;math&gt;aRb :\Leftrightarrow b \in S \cap a&lt;/math&gt;, which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, there is some sequence (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') in ''S'' satisfying ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Ra&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such ''S'' exists.

== Regularity does not resolve Russell's paradox ==
In [[naive set theory]], [[Russell's paradox]] is the fact &quot;the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as members&quot; leads to a contradiction. The paradox shows that that set cannot be constructed using any [[consistency proof|consistent]] set of axioms for set theory. Even though the axiom of regularity implies that no set contains itself as a member, that axiom does not banish Russell's paradox from [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF). In fact, if the ZF axioms without Regularity were already inconsistent, then adding Regularity would not make them consistent. Russell's paradox does not manifest in ZF because ZF does not prove that the proposed paradoxical set actually exists (e.g., ZF's [[axiom of separation]] only allows us to construct [[subset]]s of some existing set, and thus cannot be used to construct the desired set). The attempt to prove a contradiction using Russell's paradox will, in ZF, only end up proving that the collection of all sets which do not contain themselves is not a set but a [[proper class]].

== Regularity and cumulative hierarchy ==
In ZF it can be proven that the class &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{\alpha} V_\alpha \! &lt;/math&gt; (see [[cumulative hierarchy]]) is equal to the class of all sets. This statement is even equivalent to the axiom of regularity (if we work in ZF with this axiom omitted). From any model which does not satisfy axiom of regularity, a model which satisfies it can be constructed by taking only sets in &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{\alpha} V_\alpha \! &lt;/math&gt;.

'''AIX''' ('''Advanced Interactive eXecutive''', pronounced &quot;a i ex&quot;) is a series of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Unix]] [[operating system]]s developed and sold by [[IBM]] for several of its computer platforms.  Originally released for the [[IBM 6150 RT|IBM 6150]] [[RISC]] [[workstation]], AIX now supports or has supported a wide variety of hardware platforms, including the IBM [[RS/6000]] series and later [[IBM POWER]] and [[PowerPC]]-based systems, [[IBM System i]], [[System/370]] mainframes, [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] [[personal computer]]s, and the [[Apple Network Server]].   AIX is based on [[UNIX System V]] with [[4.3BSD]]-compatible extensions.  It is one of four commercial operating systems that are presently certified to [[The Open Group]]'s UNIX 03 standard.  (The others are Mac [[OS X]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[HP-UX]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/|title=The Open Brand Register of Certified Products|accessdate=2011-02-09|publisher=The Open Group|date=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIX family of operating systems debuted in 1986, became the standard operating system for the [[RS/6000]] series on its launch in 1990, and is still actively developed by IBM.  It is currently supported on [[IBM Power Systems]] alongside [[IBM i]] and [[Linux]].  AIX was the first operating system to utilize [[journalling file system]]s, and IBM has continuously enhanced the software with features like processor, disk and network [[virtualization]], dynamic hardware resource allocation (including fractional processor units), and reliability engineering ported from its [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-unix40/#aixhistory|title=UNIX turns 40|accessdate=2011-02-09|publisher=IBM Corporation|date=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AIX Version 1, introduced in 1986 for the [[IBM 6150 RT]] [[computer workstation|workstation]], was based on [[UNIX System V]] Releases 1 and 2.  In developing AIX, IBM and [[INTERACTIVE Systems Corporation]] (whom IBM contracted) also incorporated source code from 4.2 and 4.3 [[BSD]] UNIX.

Among other variants, IBM later produced AIX Version 3 (also known as '''AIX/6000'''), based on System V Release 3, for their [[IBM POWER]]-based [[RS/6000]] platform. Since 1990, AIX has served as the primary operating system for the RS/6000 series (later renamed ''[[IBM eServer]] pSeries'', then ''[[IBM System p]]'', and now ''[[IBM Power Systems]]''). AIX Version 4, introduced in 1994, added [[symmetric multiprocessing]] with the introduction of the first RS/6000 SMP servers and continued to evolve through the 1990s, culminating with AIX 4.3.3 in 1999. Version 4.1, in a slightly modified form, was also the standard operating system for the [[Apple Network Server]] systems sold by [[Apple Computer]] to complement the [[Macintosh]] line.

In the late 1990s, under [[Project Monterey]], IBM and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] planned to integrate AIX and [[UnixWare]] into a single [[32-bit]]/[[64-bit]] multiplatform UNIX with particular emphasis on running on [[Intel]] [[Itanium|IA-64]] (Itanium) architecture CPUs.  A [[beta test]] version of AIX 5L for IA-64 systems was released, but according to documents released in the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit, less than forty licenses for the finished Monterey Unix were ever sold before the project was terminated in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;grok&quot;/&gt; In 2003, the [[SCO Group]] alleged that (among other infractions) IBM had misappropriated licensed [[source code]] from [[UNIX System V]] Release 4 for incorporation into AIX; SCO subsequently withdrew IBM's license to develop and distribute AIX.  IBM maintains that their license was irrevocable, and continued to sell and support the product until the litigation was adjudicated.

AIX was a component of the 2003 ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit, in which the [[SCO Group]] filed a lawsuit against IBM, alleging IBM contributed SCO's [[intellectual property]] to the [[Linux]] kernel codebase.  The [[SCO Group]], who argued they were the rightful owners of the copyrights covering the [[Unix]] operating system, attempted to revoke IBM's license to sell or distribute the AIX operating system.  In March, 2010 a jury returned a verdict finding that [[Novell]], not the SCO Group, owns the rights to Unix.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jury verdict 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100330152829622 | title=Novell Wins Again - Jury Rules Copyrights Didn't Go to SCO | accessdate=2010-03-30 | date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIX 6 was announced in May 2007 and ran an open beta from June 2007 until the general availability (GA) of AIX 6.1 on November 9, 2007.  Major new features in AIX 6.1 included full [[role-based access control]], [[workload partitions]] (which enable application mobility), [[enhanced security]] (Addition of AES encryption type for NFS v3 and v4) and [[Live Partition Mobility]] on the POWER6 hardware.

In April 2010, IBM published an announcement about the upcoming 7.1 release. Support is planned to continue on POWER4 or later hardware generations. Several new features, including better scalability, enhanced clustering and management capabilities are mentioned. The ability to run older versions of AIX as a WPAR keeps the opportunity to continue using 5.2 where the hardware doesn't support it. IBM intends to make 7.1 available with an Open Beta program again.

==Supported hardware platforms==
===IBM 6150 RT===
The original AIX (sometimes called '''AIX/RT''') was developed for the IBM 6150 RT workstation by IBM in conjunction with [[INTERACTIVE Systems Corporation]], who had previously ported [[UNIX System III]] to the [[IBM PC]] for IBM as PC/IX.  Installation media consisted of eight [[Floppy disk|1.2M floppy disk]]s.  The RT was based on the [[ROMP]] chip, the first commercial [[RISC]] chip, based on a design, the [[IBM 801]], pioneered at IBM Research.

One of the novel aspects of the RT design was the use of a [[microkernel]], called Virtual Resource Manager (VRM).  The keyboard, mouse, display, disk drives and network were all controlled by a microkernel.  One could &quot;hotkey&quot; from one operating system to the next using the Alt-Tab key combination. Each OS in turn would get possession of the keyboard, mouse and display. Besides AIX v2, the [[PICK OS]] also utilized this microkernel.

Much of the AIX v2 kernel was written in the [[PL/I]] programming language, which proved troublesome during the migration to AIX v3.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  AIX v2 included full [[TCP/IP]] networking, as well as [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] and two networking file systems: [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], licensed from [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[Distributed Services]] (DS).  DS had the distinction of being built on top of SNA, and thereby being fully compatible with DS on the IBM midrange [[IBM System i|AS/400]] and mainframe systems.  For the graphical user interfaces, AIX v2 came with the X10R3 and later the X10R4 and X11 versions of the [[X Window System]] from MIT, together with the [[Xaw|Athena widget set]].  Compilers for [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] were available.  One of the more popular desktop applications was the [[PageMaker]] [[desktop publishing]] software.

===IBM PS/2 series===
[[Image:aixps2.gif|thumb|alt=AIX PS/2 running on Virtual PC|AIX PS/2 running on Virtual PC]]
'''AIX PS/2''' (also known as '''AIX/386''') was developed by [[Locus Computing Corporation]] under contract to IBM.  AIX PS/2, first released in 1989, ran on [[IBM PS/2]] [[personal computer]]s with [[Intel 386]] and compatible processors.

===IBM mainframes===
In 1988, IBM announced '''AIX/370''', also developed by Locus Computing.  AIX/370 was IBM's third attempt to offer [[Unix-like]] functionality for their mainframe line, specifically the [[System/370]] (the prior versions were a [[TSS/360|TSS/370]] based Unix system developed jointly with AT&amp;T c.1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cit journal
 | author=Felton et al.  | title=A Unix System Implementation for System/370 
 | journal=AT&amp;T Bell Labs Technical Journal | volume=63 | issue=8 | month=October | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VM/IX a [[VM/370]] based system developed jointly with [[INTERACTIVE Systems Corporation]] c.1984).  AIX/370 was released in 1990 with functional equivalence to System V Release 2 and 4.3BSD as well as IBM enhancements.  With the introduction of the [[ESA/390]] architecture, AIX/370 was replaced by '''AIX/ESA''' in 1991, which was based on [[OSF/1]], and also ran on the [[System/390]] platform.  This development effort was made partly to allow IBM to compete with [[Amdahl]] [[UTS (Mainframe UNIX)|UTS]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Unlike AIX/370, AIX/ESA ran both natively as the host operating system, and as a guest under [[VM (Operating system)|VM]].  AIX/ESA, while technically advanced, had little commercial success, partially because UNIX functionality was added as an option to the existing mainframe operating system, [[MVS]], which became [[MVS/ESA|MVS/ESA OpenEdition]] in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
&lt;!-- Blaxthos copyedit anchor, will return soon --&gt;

===POWER/PowerPC-based systems===
The release of AIX version 3 (sometimes called '''AIX/6000''') coincided with the announcement of the first IBM RS/6000 models. The RS/6000 was unique in that it not only outperformed all other machines in integer compute performance, but also beat the competition by a ''factor of 10'' in floating-point performance. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Releases of AIX version 3 also took advantage of the developments in the POWER architecture.

AIX v3 innovated in several ways on the software side. It was the first operating system to introduce the idea of a [[journalling file system]], [[IBM Journaled File System 2 (JFS2)|JFS]], which allowed for fast boot times by avoiding the need to ensure the consistency of the file systems on disks (see [[fsck]]) on every reboot. Another innovation was the introduction of [[shared library|shared libraries]], which avoided the need for an application to statically link to the libraries it used. The resulting smaller binaries used less of the hardware RAM to run, and used less of the disk space to install. Besides improving performance, it was a boon to developers: executable binaries could be in the 10s of [[kilobyte]]s instead of a megabyte for an executable statically linked to the [[C library]]. AIX v3 also ditched the microkernel of AIX v2, a contentious move that resulted in v3 being somewhat more &quot;pure&quot; (and containing no PL/1 code) than v2.

Other notable subsystems included:
* [[IRIS GL]], a 3D rendering library, the progenitor of [[OpenGL]]. IRIS GL was licensed by IBM from [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], then a small company which had sold only one thousand machines to date. SGI also provided the low-end graphics card for the RS/6000, capable of drawing 20,000 [[Gouraud shading|gouraud-shaded]] triangles per second. The high-end graphics card was designed by IBM, a follow-on to the mainframe-based [[IBM 5080]], capable of rendering 990K vectors per second.
* [[PHIGS]], another 3D rendering API, popular in automotive CAD/CAM circles, and at the core of [[CATIA]].
* Full implementation of version 11 of the X Window System, together with [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] as the recommended widget collection and window manager.
* Network file systems: [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] from Sun; AFS, the [[Andrew File System]]; and DFS, the [[Distributed File System]].
* NCS, the [[Network Computing System]], licensed from [[Apollo Computer]] (later acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]).
* [[Display PostScript|DPS]] on-screen display system. This was notable as a &quot;plan B&quot;, in case the X11+Motif combination failed in the marketplace. However, it was highly proprietary: only Sun and Next supported it in addition to IBM. This, in the face of the [[Open system (computing)|open system]]s challenge of X11+Motif and its lack of 3D capability, cemented its failure in the marketplace.

As of 2011, AIX runs on IBM [[IBM Power Systems|Power]], [[System p]], [[System i]], System p5, System i5, eServer p5, eServer pSeries and eServer i5 server product lines, as well as IBM [[BladeCenter]] blades based on Power Architecture technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Apple Network Servers====
The [[Apple Network Server]] systems were PowerPC-based systems designed by [[Apple Computer]] to have numerous high-end features that standard Apple hardware did not have, including swappable hard drives, redundant power supplies, and external monitoring capability. These systems were more or less based on the [[Power Macintosh]] hardware available at the time but were designed to use AIX (versions 4.1.4 or 4.1.5) as their native operating system in a specialized version specific to the ANS.

AIX was only compatible with the Network Servers and was not ported to standard Power Macintosh hardware. Not to be confused is [[A/UX]], Apple's earlier version of Unix for [[68k]]-based [[Macintosh]]es.

===IA-64 systems===
As part of [[Project Monterey]], a [[beta test]] version of AIX 5L was released for the IA-64 ([[Itanium]]) architecture in 2001, but this was abandoned before it became an official product due to lack of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;grok&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==User interfaces==
===Graphical===
The [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE) is AIX's default [[graphical user interface]]. As part of Linux Affinity and the free AIX Toolboxes for Linux Applications (ATLA), open-source [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]] desktop are also available.

===System Management Console===
[[IBM AIX SMIT|SMIT]] is the System Management Interface Tool for AIX. It allows a user to navigate a menu hierarchy of commands, rather than using the command line. Invocation is typically achieved with the command &lt;code&gt;smit&lt;/code&gt;. Experienced system administrators make use of the &lt;code&gt;F6&lt;/code&gt; function key which generates the command line that SMIT will invoke to complete the proposed task.

SMIT also generates a log of commands that are performed in the &lt;code&gt;smit.script&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code&gt;smit.script&lt;/code&gt; file automatically records the commands with the command flags and parameters used. The &lt;code&gt;smit.script&lt;/code&gt; file can be used as an executable shell script to rerun system configuration tasks. SMIT also creates the &lt;code&gt;smit.log&lt;/code&gt; file, which contains additional detailed information that can be used by programmers in extending the SMIT system.

&lt;code&gt;smit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;smitty&lt;/code&gt; refer to the same program, though &lt;code&gt;smitty&lt;/code&gt; invokes the text-based version, while &lt;code&gt;smit&lt;/code&gt; will invoke an X Window System based interface if possible; however, if &lt;code&gt;smit&lt;/code&gt; determines that X Window System capabilities are not present, it will present the text-based version instead of failing.  Determination of X Window System capabilities is typically performed by checking for the existence of the &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Original research|date=April 2009}}

'''AppleTalk''' is a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] [[protocol stack|suite of protocols]] developed by  [[Apple Inc.]] for networking computers. It was included in the original [[Macintosh]] released in 1984, and is now unsupported with the release of [[Mac OS X v10.6]] in 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;snow_leopard_printing&quot;&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3771 &quot;Mac OS X v10.6: Mac 101 – Printing&quot;]. Retrieved on 2009-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of [[TCP/IP]] networking. AppleTalk's Datagram Delivery Protocol corresponds closely to the Network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection ([[OSI model|OSI]]) communication model.

== Design ==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}
The AppleTalk design rigorously followed the [[OSI model]] of protocol layering.  Unlike most of the early [[local area network|LAN]] systems, AppleTalk was not built using the archetypal [[Xerox XNS]] system.  The intended target was not [[Ethernet]], and it did not have 48-bit addresses to route.  Nevertheless, many portions of the AppleTalk system have direct analogs in XNS.

One key differentiation for AppleTalk was it contained three protocols aimed at making the system completely self-configuring.  The ''AppleTalk address resolution protocol'' (''AARP'') allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own network addresses, and the ''Name Binding Protocol'' (''NBP'') was dynamic system for mapping network addresses to user-readable names.  Although systems similar to AARP existed in other systems, [[Banyan VINES]] for instance, nothing like NBP has existed until recently.

Both AARP and NBP had defined ways to allow &quot;controller&quot; devices to override the default mechanisms. The concept was to allow routers to provide the information or  &quot;hardwire&quot; the system to known addresses and names.  On larger networks where AARP could cause problems as new nodes searched for free addresses, the addition of a router could reduce &quot;chattiness.&quot;  Together AARP and NBP made AppleTalk an easy-to-use networking system.  New machines were added to the network by plugging them and optionally giving them a name.  The NBP lists were examined and displayed by a program known as the ''[[Apple Chooser|Chooser]]'' which would display a list of machines on the local network, divided into classes such as file-servers and printers.

== History ==

AppleTalk was intended to be part of a project known as ''[[Macintosh Office]],'' which would consist of a host machine providing routing, printer sharing and file sharing.  However this project was canceled in 1986.  Despite this, the [[LaserWriter]] included built-in AppleTalk.  Apple later released an AppleTalk server suite known as [[AppleShare]], and included basic AppleTalk features as the default network protocol in later releases of &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS (System).

With the introduction of [[Mac OS X]], AppleTalk was largely displaced.  [[Internet protocol suite|Internet-based]] protocols were used as the defaults, although AppleTalk was supported for backwards compatibility at first.  [[Mac OS X v10.5]] was the last Apple OS to support AppleTalk.&lt;ref name=&quot;snow_leopard_printing&quot; /&gt;

== Addressing ==
An AppleTalk address was a 4-byte quantity. This consisted of a two-byte network number, a one-byte node number, and a one-byte socket number. Of these, only the network number required any configuration, being obtained from a router. Each node dynamically chose its own node number, according to a protocol (originally the LocalTalk Link Access Protocol LLAP and later the AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol, AARP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside AppleTalk, Second Edition |last=Sidhu |first=Gursharan |authorlink= |coauthors=Rick Andrews and Alan Oppenheimer |year=1990 |publisher=Addison Wesley |location= Reading, Mass.|isbn= 0-201-55021-0|pages= 1–1ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; which handled contention between different nodes accidentally choosing the same number. For socket numbers, a few well-known numbers were reserved for special purposes specific to the AppleTalk protocol itself. Apart from these, all application-level protocols were expected to use dynamically-assigned socket numbers at both the client and server end.

Because of this dynamism, users could not be expected to access services by specifying their address. Instead, all services had ''names'' which, being chosen by humans, could be expected to be meaningful to users, and also could be sufficiently long enough to minimize the chance of conflicts.

Note that, because a name translated to an address, which included a socket number as well as a node number, a name in AppleTalk mapped directly to a ''service'' being provided by a machine, which was entirely separate from the name of the machine itself. Thus, services could be moved to a different machine and, so long as they kept the same service name, there was no need for users to do anything different to continue accessing the service. And the same machine could host any number of instances of services of the same type, without any network connection conflicts.

Contrast this with ''A records'' in the [[Domain Name System|DNS]], where a name translates only to a machine address, not including the port number that might be providing a service. Thus, if people are accustomed to using a particular machine name to access a particular service, their access will break when the service is moved to a different machine. This can be mitigated somewhat by insistence on using ''CNAME records'' indicating service rather than actual machine names to refer to the service, but there is no way of guaranteeing that users will follow such a convention.  (Some newer protocols, such as [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] and [[Active Directory]] use DNS [[SRV record]]s to identify services by name, which is much closer to the AppleTalk model.)

== Protocols ==
=== AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol ===
AARP resolves AppleTalk addresses to [[physical layer]], usually [[MAC address|MAC]], addresses. It is functionally equivalent to [[Address resolution protocol|ARP]].

AARP is a fairly simple system. When powered on, an AppleTalk machine broadcasts an ''AARP probe packet'' asking for a network address, intending to hear back from controllers such as routers. If no address is provided, one is picked at random from the &quot;base subnet&quot;, 0. It then broadcasts another packet saying &quot;I am selecting this address&quot;, and then waits to see if anyone else on the network complains. If another machine has that address, it will pick another address, and keep trying until it finds a free one. On a network with many machines it may take several tries before a free address is found, so for performance purposes the successful address is &quot;written down&quot; in [[NVRAM]] and used as the default address in the future. This means that in most real-world setups where machines are added a few at a time, only one or two tries are needed before the address effectively become constant.

=== AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol ===
This was a comparatively late addition to the AppleTalk protocol suite, done when it became clear that a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]-style reliable connection-oriented transport was needed. Significant differences from TCP were:
* a connection attempt could be rejected
* there were no &quot;half-open&quot; connections; once one end initiated a tear-down of the connection, the whole connection would be closed (''i.e.'', ADSP is [[duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]], not [[dual simplex]]).

=== Apple Filing Protocol ===
The [[Apple Filing Protocol]] (AFP), formerly AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is the protocol for communicating with [[AppleShare]] file servers. Built on top of AppleTalk Session Protocol (for legacy AFP over DDP) or the [[Data Stream Interface]] (for AFP over TCP), it provides services for authenticating users (extensible to different authentication methods including two-way random-number exchange) and for performing operations specific to the Macintosh [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] filesystem. AFP is still in use in Mac OS X, even though most other AppleTalk protocols have been deprecated.

=== AppleTalk Session Protocol ===
ASP was an intermediate protocol, built on top of ATP, which in turn was the foundation of AFP. It provided basic services for requesting responses to arbitrary ''commands'' and performing out-of-band status queries. It also allowed the server to send asynchronous ''attention'' messages to the client.

=== AppleTalk Transaction Protocol ===
ATP was the original reliable transport-level protocol for AppleTalk, built on top of DDP. At the time it was being developed, a full, reliable connection-oriented protocol like TCP was considered to be too expensive to implement for most of the intended uses of AppleTalk. Thus, ATP was a simple request/response exchange, with no need to set up or tear down connections.

An ATP ''request'' packet could be answered by up to eight ''response'' packets. The requestor then sent an ''acknowledgement'' packet containing a bit mask indicating which of the response packets it received, so the responder could retransmit the remainder.

ATP could operate in either &quot;at-least-once&quot; mode or &quot;exactly-once&quot; mode. Exactly-once mode was essential for operations which were not [[idempotent]]; in this mode, the responder kept a copy of the response buffers in memory until successful receipt of a ''release'' packet from the requestor, or until a timeout elapsed. This way, it could respond to duplicate requests with the same transaction ID by resending the same response data, without performing the actual operation again.**

=== Datagram Delivery Protocol ===
DDP was the lowest-level data-link-independent transport protocol. It provided a [[datagram]] service with no guarantees of delivery. All application-level protocols, including the infrastructure protocols NBP, RTMP and ZIP, were built on top of DDP.

=== Name Binding Protocol ===
NBP was a dynamic, distributed system for managing AppleTalk names. When a service started up on a machine, it registered a name for itself on that machine, as chosen by a human administrator. At this point, NBP provided a system for checking that no other machine had already registered the same name. Then later, when a client wanted to access that service, it used NBP to query machines to find that service. NBP provided browseability (&quot;what are the names of  all the services available?&quot;) as well as the ability to find a service with a particular name.

Names were human readable, containing spaces, upper and lower case letters, and including support for searching.

=== Printer Access Protocol ===
PAP was the standard way of communicating with [[PostScript]] printers. It was built on top of ATP. When a PAP connection was opened, each end sent the other an ATP request which basically meant &quot;send me more data&quot;. The client's response to the server was to send a block of PostScript code, while the server could respond with any diagnostic messages that might be generated as a result, after which another &quot;send-more-data&quot; request was sent. This use of ATP provided automatic [[flow control]]; each end could only send data to the other end if there was an outstanding ATP request to respond to.

PAP also provided for out-of-band status queries, handled by separate ATP transactions. Even while it was busy servicing a print job from one client, a PAP server could continue to respond to status requests from any number of other clients. This allowed other Macintoshes on the LAN that were waiting to print to display status messages indicating that the printer was busy, and what the job was that it was busy with.

=== Routing Table Maintenance Protocol ===
RTMP was the protocol by which routers kept each other informed about the topology of the network. This was the only part of AppleTalk that required periodic unsolicited broadcasts: every 10 seconds, each router had to send out a list of all the network numbers it knew about and how far away it thought they were.

=== Zone Information Protocol ===
ZIP was the protocol by which AppleTalk network numbers were associated with zone names. A ''zone'' was a subdivision of the network that made sense to humans (for example, &quot;Accounting Department&quot;); but while a network number had to be assigned to a topologically-contiguous section of the network, a zone could include several different discontiguous portions of the network.

== Physical implementation ==

The initial default hardware implementation for AppleTalk was a high-speed serial protocol known as ''[[LocalTalk]]'' that used the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]'s built-in [[RS-422]] ports at 230.4 kbit/s. LocalTalk used a splitter box in the RS-422 port to provide an upstream and downstream cable from a single port. The topology was a [[Bus network|bus]]: cables were daisy-chained from each connected machine to the next, up to the maximum of 32 permitted on any [[LocalTalk]] segment. The system was slow by today's standards, but at the time the additional cost and complexity of networking on PC machines was such that it was common that Macs were the only networked personal computers in an office. Other larger computers, such as UNIX or VAX workstations, would commonly be networked via Ethernet.

Other physical implementations were also available. One common replacement for LocalTalk was ''[[PhoneNet]]'', a 3rd party solution (from a company called Farallon, now called [[Netopia]]) that also used the RS-422 port and was indistinguishable from LocalTalk as far as Apple's LocalTalk port drivers were concerned, but ran over two unused wires in existing phone cabling. PhoneNet was considerably less expensive to install and maintain. [[Ethernet]] and [[Token Ring]] was also supported, known as ''EtherTalk'' and ''TokenTalk'' respectively. EtherTalk in particular gradually became the dominant implementation method for AppleTalk as Ethernet became generally popular in the PC industry throughout the 1990s. Besides AppleTalk and [[TCP/IP]], any Ethernet network could also simultaneously carry other protocols such as [[DECnet]], [[NetBEUI]], and [[IPX]].

==Cross-platform solutions==
When AppleTalk was first introduced the dominant office computing platform was the PC compatible running MS-DOS. The &quot;TOPS Teleconnector&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tops&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbronline.com/news/tops_unveils_interface_to_link_ms_dos_micros_to_appletalk_networks_1 TOPS Teleconnector] MS-DOS networking system over AppleTalk&lt;/ref&gt; system enabled MS-DOS PCs to communicate over AppleTalk network hardware; it comprised an AppleTalk interface card for the PC and a suite of networking software allowing such functions as file, drive and printer sharing. As well as allowing the construction of a PC-only AppleTalk network, it allowed communication between PCs and Macs with TOPS software installed. (Macs without TOPS installed could use the same network but only to communicate with other Apple machines.) The Mac TOPS software did not match the quality of Apple's own either in ease of use or in robustness and freedom from crashes, but the DOS software was relatively simple to use in DOS terms, and was robust.

The [[BSD]] and [[Linux]] operating systems support AppleTalk through an open source project called [[Netatalk]], which implements the complete protocol suite and allows them to both act as native file or print servers for Macintosh computers, and print to LocalTalk printers over the network.

The [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] Server operating systems supported AppleTalk starting with [[Windows NT]] and ending after [[Windows Server 2003]].  Miramar included AppleTalk in its PC MacLAN product which was discontinued by CA in 2007.   [[Group Logic]] continues to bundle its AppleTalk protocol with its [[ExtremeZ-IP]] server software for Macintosh-Windows integration which supports [[Windows 2008 Server]] and [[Windows Vista]] as well prior versions.

In addition, Columbia University released the Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) which implemented the protocol suite for various Unix flavors including [[Ultrix]], [[SunOS]], *[[BSD]] and [[IRIX]].  This package is no longer actively maintained.

The '''Apple II series''' is a set of [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s, one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]] products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars/4 |title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed primarily by [[Steve Wozniak]], manufactured by Apple Computer (now [[Apple Inc.]]) and introduced in 1977 with the [[Apple II|original Apple II]]. In terms of ease of use, features and expandability the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the [[Apple I]], a limited-production bare [[circuit board]] computer for electronics hobbyists that pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in 1977, the Apple II was among the first successful [[personal computer]]s; it launched the Apple company into a successful business (and allowed several related companies to start). Throughout the years, a number of models were sold, with the most popular model remaining relatively little changed into the 1990s. By the end of production in 1993, somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers (including about 1.25 million Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; models)&lt;!-- Cites: http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/04/16/jobs/ http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1993/ALMP9309.TXT http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1995/ALMP9511.TXT http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1993/ALMP9309.TXT - the previous entry claimed only 2 million Apple II-line machines had been produced total, which is incorrect (in fact Apple surpassed 2 million Apple II sales in 1984) --&gt; had been produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Forster|first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972 - 2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple II became one of the most recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in [[United States|American]] secondary schools. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]], made the computer especially popular with business users and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple II Biography|url=http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=6|author=Chris Cavanaugh|date=May 2004| accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple II: The World Catches On|url= http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/07/apple-ii-the-world-catches-on/|author=Wilson Rothman|date= 2009-07-19|accessdate=2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Spreadsheet|url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm|author=Mary Bellis|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Apple II [[operating system]] was contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] along with [[Integer BASIC]]. Programs were entered, then saved and loaded on cassette tape. When the [[Disk II]] was implemented in 1978 by Steve Wozniak, a Disk Operating System or DOS was commissioned. The final and most popular version of this software was [[Apple DOS]] 3.3. Some commercial Apple II software booted directly and did not use standard DOS formats. This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed. Apple DOS was superseded by [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based [[expansion card]]&lt;ref name=z80&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=6 February 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apple II could boot into the [[CP/M]] operating system and run [[WordStar]], [[dBase II]], and other CP/M software. At the height of its evolution, towards the late 1980s, the platform had the graphical look of a hybrid of the Apple II and [[Macintosh]] with the introduction of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. By 1992, the platform had [[16-bit]] processing capabilities, a mouse-driven [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]], and graphics and sound capabilities far beyond the original.

Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based [[Apple Lisa]] system in 1983, and its more successful cousin the [[Macintosh]] in 1984, the relatively unsophisticated Apple II series was Apple's primary revenue source for most of the following decade. At its peak, it was a billion-dollar-a-year industry with its associated community of third-party developers and retailers. The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; was sold until the end of 1992; the last II-series Apple in production, the IIe, was discontinued on October 15, 1993.

==Design==
The Apple II was designed to look more like a [[Small appliance|home appliance]] than a piece of electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer, Carl, &quot;An Apple to Byte,&quot; Byte, March 1978, p. 18-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The lid popped off the beige plastic case without the use of tools, allowing access to the computer's internals, including the [[motherboard]] with eight [[expansion slot]]s, and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that could hold up to 48&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte]]s worth of memory chips.

The Apple II had color and high-resolution [[Apple II graphics|graphics modes]], sound capabilities and one of two built-in [[BASIC]] programming languages (initially [[Integer BASIC]], later [[Applesoft BASIC]]). The Apple II was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers; it also influenced most of the microcomputers that followed it. Unlike preceding home microcomputers, it was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit (unassembled or preassembled). ''VanLOVEs Apple Handbook'' and ''The Apple Educators Guide'' by Gerald VanDiver and Rolland Love reviewed more than 1,500 software programs that the Apple II series could use. The Apple dealer network used this book to emphasize the growing software developer base in education and personal use. &lt;!-- What does this mean?? : &quot;The books became part of the Apple program and became the first book on database.&quot; What Apple program? What about a database? --&gt;

The Apple II series had a keyboard built into the motherboard shell, with the exception of the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]] which featured an external keyboard. An upgrade kit was sold later to house the motherboard of an Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in an [[Apple IIe]] case.

==Models==
{{See also|Timeline of computing}}

Early II-series models were usually designated &quot;Apple ][&quot;; later models &quot;Apple //&quot;, plus a letter suffix.

===Apple II===
[[File:Micromodem II in Apple II.jpg|thumb|250px|An Apple II computer with an external [[modem]]]]
The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 5, 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 5, 1977: From a Little Apple a Mighty Industry Grows|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/06/dayintech_0605|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor running at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]], 4 KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], an [[compact audio cassette#Data recording|audio cassette]] interface for loading programs and storing data, and the [[Integer BASIC]] programming language built into the [[read-only memory|ROMs]]. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] [[composite video]] output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate [[RF modulator]]. The original retail price of the computer was [[United States dollar|US$]]1298&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster| first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972 - 2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with 4&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's [[Apple II graphics|color graphics]] capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple II History Chapter 4|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04.html|author=Steven Weyhrich|date=April 21, 2002|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple II's were assembled in [[Silicon Valley]], and later in [[Texas]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Rose|title=West of Eden |publisher=Arrow Books|year=1989|page=3|isbn=0-09-976200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[printed circuit board]]s were manufactured in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Singapore]].

An external 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by [[Steve Wozniak]], was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Apple II History Chapter 5, The Disk II|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html| author=Steven Weyhrich|date=December 28, 2001|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freiberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine. &quot;Fire In The Valley, Part Two (Book Excerpt)&quot;, A+ Magazine, January 1985: 45.&lt;/ref&gt; While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the [[Apple DOS]] used software to perform these functions. The [[Group Code Recording]] used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for [[proprietary software]] developers to [[copy protection|copy-protect]] the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called &quot;recalibration&quot;, made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.

The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel [[font]] rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Steve|title=The origins of sub-pixel font rendering|url=http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm|accessdate=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC [[television]] signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&amp;W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen.

The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the colorburst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.

The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip (though with six expansion slots, users could add sound functionality via a soundcard like the [[Mockingboard]]). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that served as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.

Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|Serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, and networking components. There were plug-in [[expansion card]]s — such as the ''Z80-card''&lt;ref name=z80/&gt; — that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the [[CP/M]] operating system,&lt;ref name=&quot;z80&quot;/&gt; including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that would allow [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. The [[Mockingboard]] sound card greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

===Apple II Plus===
 {{Main|Apple II Plus}}
[[File:Apple II Plus.jpg|thumb|right|Apple II Plus]]
The '''Apple II Plus''', introduced in June 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah06.html|title=Apple II History Chap 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/0509.html|title=Macintosh Prehistory: The Apple I and Apple II Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/products.html|title=Apple Products}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/madkins/timeline.html|title=EDTechTimeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; included the [[Applesoft BASIC]] programming language in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. This [[Microsoft]]-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC).

The Apple II Plus was otherwise identical to the original Apple II. The smaller memory sizes were no longer available, so the II Plus always had a total of 48&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM, expandable to 64&amp;nbsp;kB by means of the &quot;language card&quot;, a 16&amp;nbsp;kB RAM expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support up to 64&amp;nbsp;kB of memory, and a machine with 48&amp;nbsp;kB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12&amp;nbsp;kB of read-only memory and 4&amp;nbsp;kB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the [[UCSD Pascal]] and [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN 77]] compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] operating system, which had its own disk format and emitted code for a &quot;virtual machine&quot; rather than the actual 6502 processor.
The UCSD P-system had a curious approach to [[memory management]], which became even more curious on the [[Apple III]].

A [[TEMPEST]] approved version of the Apple II Plus called the Microfix was developed in 1980 by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] for [[U.S. Army]] [[FORSCOM]]. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk ([[Laserdisk]]) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as [[order of battle]], airfields, roadways, and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159|title=The development of small computer geographic analysis systems for military applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/raw-attachment/wiki/Presentations/Moving_Maps.pdf|title= Moving Maps: Evolution in GIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34_3.pdf|title=U.S. Army Field Manual 34-3, Intelligence Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple II Europlus and J-Plus===
After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and the [[Far East]] in 1978, with the '''Apple II Europlus''' (Europe, Australia) and the '''Apple II J-Plus''' (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and [[firmware]] changes in order to comply to standards outside of the U.S. The [[power supply]] was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European and Australian model the video output signal was changed from color [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] to monochrome [[Phase Alternating Line|PAL]] — an extra video card was needed for color PAL graphics, since the simple tricks Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the keyboard layout was changed to allow for [[Katakana]] writing (full [[Kanji]] support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]], for example. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983.

===Apple IIe===
{{Main|Apple IIe}}
[[Image:Apple iie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Apple IIe with DuoDisk and Monitor //.]]

The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the '''[[Apple IIe]]''', a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM.

The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48&amp;nbsp;kB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80-column cards in the II Plus.

The auxiliary slot could accept a 1&amp;nbsp;kB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe, remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx-style cards, even though the low-level details were very different. An &quot;extended 80-column card&quot; with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128&amp;nbsp;kB.

As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]] operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a [[RAM disk]] upon booting.

Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]. The {{nowrap|1 K}} 80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (80×48 pixels). The extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560×192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (40×48) and Hi-Res (280×192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIe's from the very first production run cannot use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC, however, so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands in BASIC, or assembly language programming, or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes.

While it was possible for software to switch out the 80-column firmware, making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot, it was not a common thing to do. However, even with the 80-column firmware enabled, slot 3's I/O memory range was still usable, giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus. This meant that it actually was possible to use slot 3 for things, such as coprocessor cards and language cards, that did not use slot firmware space.

Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5.25-inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was (by design) functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself.

The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the &quot;workhorse&quot; of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time — it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the [[Apple IIe#The Enhanced IIe|Enhanced IIe]] (four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model [[Apple IIc]], including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the [[Apple IIe Platinum|Platinum IIe]] (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad). An Enhanced IIe with 128&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988.

Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple had produced and marketed a computer called the ''[[Apple III]]'' for business users. This product was not a success, and Steve Wozniak has been quoted as saying that the Apple III had a 100% failure rate — every single machine manufactured had some kind of fault (a famous Apple technical bulletin recommended dropping the machine vertically onto a table to re-seat the DIP chips in their loose sockets{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}). Still, many of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe, without the manufacturing flaws that led to failures in the Apple III. Among them was the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III's Sophisticated Operating System (SOS).

===Apple IIc===
{{Main|Apple IIc}}
[[Image:Apple iicb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer.]]

Apple released the '''[[Apple IIc]]''' in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern [[portable computer|portables]] it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the [[Snow White design language]], and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kunkel, Paul, AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; (The other Snow White computers from the Apple II series, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; and the IIc Plus, were light gray, called &quot;Platinum&quot; by Apple.)

The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128&amp;nbsp;kB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3½-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.

To play up the portability, two different monochrome [[LCD]] displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. (An Apple IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''.) The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12&amp;nbsp;V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.

The Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]], which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; (accessible via the built-in control panel). The international models used the same mechanism to switch between the localized and the American keyboard layouts, but did not offer Dvorak.

===Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;===
{{Main|Apple IIGS}}
[[Image:Apple IIGS.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS, the most powerful Apple II, featuring a true 16-bit CPU, 4096 colors, Ensoniq synthesizer, a Mac-like GUI and a mouse.]]
[[Image:Apple iigs.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS setup, with keyboard and mouse shown.]]

The next member of the line was the '''[[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]]''' computer, released on September 15, 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; featured a true [[16-bit]] microprocessor, the [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]], operating at {{nowrap|2.8&amp;nbsp;MHz}} with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines (RAM cards with more than 4&amp;nbsp;MB were never directly supported by Apple&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Joe. ''A2Pro Roundtable'', October 1991, Category 16, Topic 2.&lt;/ref&gt;). It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time, although a technique known as ''[[dither]]ing'' was often employed in software to increase the number of perceived colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;&gt;Duprau, Jeanne, and Tyson, Molly. &quot;The Making of the Apple IIGS&quot;, ''A+ Magazine'', November 1986: 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this &quot;mode&quot; was best suited to displaying static images.

The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;'s compatibility was a single chip called the [[Mega II]], which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software.

The computer also included a 32-voice [[Ensoniq]] [[Ensoniq 5503|5503]], '[[wavetable synthesis|wavetable']] [[sample-based synthesis|sample-based music synthesizer]] chip with 64&amp;nbsp;kB dedicated RAM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple IIGS|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=71|author=Old-Computers.com Museum|year=|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 256&amp;nbsp;kB of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in [[AppleTalk]] networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS.&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;/&gt; The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories — just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping.

The first 50,000 Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; computers came with Steve Wozniak's &quot;''Woz''&quot; signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the &quot;''Woz Limited Edition''&quot;. These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature.

===Apple IIc Plus===
{{Main|Apple IIc Plus}}
[[Image:Apple IIc Plus (front).jpg|thumb|right|The Apple IIc Plus, an 8-bit revision of the original portable but with faster CPU, 3.5-inch floppy and built-in power supply. It was the last introduced of the Apple II line.]]

The final Apple II model was the '''[[Apple IIc Plus]]''' introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a 3½-inch drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's &quot;brick on a leash&quot; power supply), and the processor was a fast {{nowrap|4&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as {{nowrap|10&amp;nbsp;MHz}}, and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; accelerators would eventually reach {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}}.) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a [[megabyte]] of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. Unlike the IIe, IIc and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA.

Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the [[Laser 128|Laser 128EX/2]], a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3.5-inch drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. However, with its 3.5-inch drive and speedy processor, it was an excellent, compact machine for running the [[AppleWorks]] integrated productivity package, especially with the 1&amp;nbsp;MB memory upgrade.

===Apple IIe Card===
{{Main|Apple IIe Card}}

Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the '''[[Apple IIe Card]]''', an expansion card for the [[Macintosh LC|LC]] line of [[Macintosh]] computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through [[hardware emulation]] (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3.5-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.

===Final years===
Apple's [[Macintosh]] product line finally eclipsed the Apple II in the early 1990s. Even after the Macintosh's introduction, the Apple II had remained the company's primary revenue source for years. The computer was the first to attract a loyal user community and many outspoken Apple II fans were bitter that the company had invested its Apple II profits into the Macintosh rather than using them to further the Apple II series.

Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in December, 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applematters.com/collections/apple-iigs/ |title=Apple IIGS // Collections |publisher=Applematters.com |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IIe in November, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Weyhrich |url=http://apple2history.org/history/appy/ahb5.html |title=Apple II History Timeline |publisher=Apple2history.org |date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising, marketing, and packaging==
[[Mike Markkula]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Markkula1997&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|date=1997-09-01|work=[[New York Times]] | first=John | last=Markoff | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a retired [[Intel]] salesman who provided early critical funding for Apple Computer, was keen on marketing. From 1977-1981, Apple used the [[Regis McKenna]] agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, [[Chiat/Day|Chiat-Day]] acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of [[Rob Janoff]], art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case. Steve Jobs insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded &quot;a&quot; of the logotype echoed the &quot;bite&quot; in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Ever since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of [[Steve Jobs]]' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Moritz|Moritz, Michael]]. ''The Little Kingdom''. New York, William Morrow and Company, Inc, 1984: pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Apple's packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring lots of clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/appleIIgs-wozedition/complete-system/index.html A gallery of Apple IIGS packaging] from DigiBarn&lt;/ref&gt; For several years up until the late 1980s, Apple used the [[Apple typography#Motter Tektura|Motter Tekkura]] font for packaging, until changing to the [[Typography and logography of Apple Computer#Apple Garamond|Apple Garamond]] font.

Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II in the July 1977 edition of ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' — a two page spread ad titled &quot;Introducing the Apple II&quot; and followed by a third page that was an order form. The first brochure, was entitled &quot;Simplicity&quot; and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered &quot;demystifying&quot; language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more &quot;personal.&quot; The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September 1977 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.pyproject=Macintosh&amp;story=1984.txt&amp;topic=Marketing&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Apple IIc, Apple wanted an advertisement to demonstrate the power of the machine despite its small size; they ran a memorable television commercial featuring a high-rise office building in which they claimed with words and images that the IIc had all the power necessary to run a large building, suggesting that it had more than enough power for the home user. (This ad, along with the ''1984'' Macintosh ad, was featured in a Marketing telecourse run on PBS.&lt;!-- Marketing is the name and the subject of the telecourse. --&gt;)

Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, emphasizing its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/movies9.html|title=Apple //gs Commercials Quicktime Movies @ The Apple Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of 1982, art director Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden came up with the idea of doing an [[advertising campaign]] based on the timely tagline &quot;Why 1984 will not be like 1984&quot;. Chiat-Day shopped it around to a number of clients, including Apple, where it was proposed to be used for a print ad in [[the Wall Street Journal]] promoting the Apple II. However, Apple did not go for it, and the idea was filed away until the spring of 1983, when they met with the Macintosh marketing team to start working on the launch, which was scheduled for January 1984. The idea eventually became the famous ''[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]'' commercial which aired during the third quarter at [[Super Bowl XVIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=1984.txt&amp;topic=Marketing&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date|title=Folklore.org: Macintosh Stories: 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clones==
[[Image:Taiwanese Apple II clone Cosmo.jpg|thumb|The Jiama (嘉馬) SPS-109, a [[Republic of China|Taiwanese]] clone of the Apple II, looks almost identical to the Apple II and II+, including an identical [[computer case|case]], color and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] layout. The only noticeable physical difference is the label above the keyboard.]]

The Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the [[United States]] and abroad — similar cloning of the IBM PC later occurred. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of [[List of Apple II clones|Apple II clones]] were manufactured. Many of these had &quot;fruit&quot; names (for example, &quot;Pineapple&quot;) to indicate to the initiated that they were Apple II clones. Well-known in the [[Soviet Bloc]] were the [[Agat computer|Agat]], an oversized Russian Apple II clone with a [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] character set, and [[Bulgaria]]n [[Pravetz series 8]], a close Apple II replica with Cyrillic support.

Basis, a German company, created the Basis 108,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=92 |title=The Museum |publisher=Old-Computers.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clone for the Apple II that included both a 6502 processor and the Zilog Z80, allowing it to run the CP/M operating system as well as most Apple II software. This machine was unusual in that it was housed in a heavy cast aluminum chassis. The Basis 108 was equipped with built-in [[Centronics]] (parallel) and RS232c (serial) ports, as well as the standard six Apple II compatible slots. Unlike the Apple II it came with a detached full-stroke keyboard (AZERTY/QWERTY) of 100 keys plus 15 functions keys and separate numeric and editing keypads.

A [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] (at the time part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) company named [[IRIS Computers]] (sub company of biggest electric company in Bosnia and [[Herzegovina]] and Yugoslavia ENERGOINVEST) has produced Apple II clones since the early 1980s. Their official brand name was IRIS 8. They were very expensive and hard to obtain and were produced primarily for usage in early computerized digital telephone systems and for education. Their usage in offices of the state companies, R&amp;D labs and in the Yugoslav army was also reported. IRIS 8 had looks of early IBM PCs — separate central unit with cooling system and two 5.25-inch disks, monitor and keyboard. Compatibility with original Apple II was complete. Elite high schools in Yugoslavia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina were equipped with clusters of 8, 16 or 32 IRIS 8 computers connected in local network administrated by IRIS 16 PC clone. The number of IRIS 8's produced could be as many as a couple of tens of thousands{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

An [[Australia]]n-produced clone of the Apple II was the [[Medfly computer|Medfly]], named after the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters and a built-in disk controller.

Unitron, a Brazilian company, produced another clone, named ApII. Unitron used a copy of the Apple's ROM translated to Portuguese. The operating system was Apple's DOS 3.3 translated to Portuguese. During this period, it was illegal to import microcomputers in Brazil, and buying those (illegal) clones was the only way to have a microcomputer. Unitron stopped manufacturing the ApII a few years after the introduction of IBM PC clones in Brazil.

The Ace clones from [[Franklin Computer Corporation]] are the best known and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's argument: a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.]]) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.

Apple also challenged [[VTech]]'s [[Laser 128]], an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, [[Microsoft]]. Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; VTech was the first cloner to license it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in accelerated versions that ran faster than {{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;MHz}}. Although it was not 100% compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well as on genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as [[Sears]], the Laser 128 may have cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as [[Commodore Business Machines]] as much as it did Apple's.

While the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3½-inch drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.

[[Böwe Bell &amp; Howell|Bell &amp; Howell]], an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case. However, these were in fact real Apple II Plus units manufactured by Apple for B&amp;H for a brief period of time. Many schools had a few of these Black Apple or [[Apple II Plus#Bell &amp; Howell|Black &quot;Darth Vader&quot; Apples]] in their labs.

[[ITT Corporation|ITT]] created an Apple II Plus-compatible for the European market called the ITT 2020 (Europlus). This machine was built under license from Apple. It has the same shape as the Apple II but a different color (matte silver), and is not an exact copy functionally.

Syscom 2 Inc (from Carson City, NV) created the Syscom 2 Apple ][+ clone. The case looked nearly identical. They had 48&amp;nbsp;k RAM and the normal expansion capabilities. These clones also supported lower case characters, toggled with a ^O keystroke.

An unknown company produced a clone called the RX-8800. One new feature it had was a numeric keypad.

Although not technically a clone, [[Quadram]] produced an add-in [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] card, called the Quadlink, that provided hardware emulation of an Apple II+ for the [[IBM PC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/pipermail/cctech/2005-January/037465.html|title=Quadlink by Quadram - put an Apple II in you PC|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card had its own 6502 CPU and dedicated 80&amp;nbsp;K RAM (64&amp;nbsp;K for applications, plus 16&amp;nbsp;K to hold a reverse-engineered Apple ROM image, loaded at boot-time), and installed &quot;between&quot; the PC and its floppy drive(s), color display, and speaker, in a pass-through configuration. This allowed the PC to operate in a [[dual-boot]] fashion: when booted through the Quadlink, the PC could run the majority of II software, and read and write Apple-formatted floppies through the standard PC floppy drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textfiles.com/digitize/items/1984-quadram-quips/.m/1984-quadram-quips-03.jpg|title=Quadram Quips (sales flyer)|publisher=[[Quadram]]|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it had a dedicated processor, rather than any form of software emulation, this system ran at nearly the same speed as an equivalent Apple machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/53_The_new_blue_Apple_Quadl.php|title=The new blue Apple; Quadlink makes your IBM think it's an Apple|publisher=[[Creative Computing]]|date=December 1983|last=Arrants|first=Stephen|accessdate= 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wS8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=quadram+quadlink#v=onepage&amp;q=quadram%20quadlink&amp;f=false|title=Review: Quadlink|publisher=[[Infoworld]]|year=1983|last=Lombardi|
first=John V|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another company, Diamond Computer Systems, produced a similar card called the Trackstar, that had both a 6502 &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; a Z80, allowing use of software for both Apple DOS and Apple CP/M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n11/67_Build_a_better_computer_.php|title=Build a better computer; a look at some new, interesting, and affordable additions for your IBM PC|publisher=[[Creative Computing]]|last=Lockwood|first=Russ|
date=November 1985|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trackstar also had a connector allowing use of an actual Apple floppy drive, which enhanced its compatibility with software that took advantage of Apple hardware for copy-protection.

==General==
===Data storage===
Originally the Apple II used [[audio cassette]] tapes for program and data storage. A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the [[Commodore Datasette]] was never produced; Apple recommended using the [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]] RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market.

The Disk II floppy drive used 5.25-inch [[floppy disk]]s. The first [[disk operating system]]s for the Apple II were [[Apple DOS|DOS 3.1]] and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75&amp;nbsp;kB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of 13 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140&amp;nbsp;kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks.

On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero — which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic &quot;chattering&quot; sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail — and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average [[seek time]] to the frequently-used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.

Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage &quot;crackers&quot; from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily.

Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160&amp;nbsp;kB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; simple modifications to DOS for formatting the extra track were common.

Incidentally, although the Apple Disk II stored 140&amp;nbsp;kB on single-sided, &quot;single-density&quot; floppy disks, it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a floppy disk to 280&amp;nbsp;kB — by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a &quot;disk notcher&quot; (although a simple hole puncher would do) and inserting the disk flipped over. Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for the same amount of money, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.

Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800&amp;nbsp;kB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400&amp;nbsp;kB had to be split up into multiple &quot;virtual disk volumes.&quot; [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS, became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32&amp;nbsp;MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks required it.

===Renditions of the &quot;II&quot; name===
The &quot;II&quot; portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using stylized characters which resembled punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead. The II and II+ were labeled &lt;nowiki&gt;][ and ][ plus&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; and II&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt; Plus were rendered in [[small caps]]. The [[Apple III]], IIc, and IIe models used slashes: ///, //c and //e. There have been some errors in the Apple II's name due to the numerous variations and forms on the &quot;II&quot;.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

===Legacy===
Today, [[Apple II emulators|emulators]] for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], homebrew enabled [[Nintendo DS]] and other operating systems. Numerous [[disk image]]s of Apple II software are available free over the [[Internet]] for use with these emulators. [[AppleWin]] and [[Multi Emulator Super System|MESS]] are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images. The MESS emulator supports recording and playing back of Apple II emulation sessions. The [http://www.homeactionreplay.org/search.php?tourney=36 Home Action Replay Page] (aka HARP) allows Apple II users to archive their favorite play sessions of the Apple II system and its games. However, many emulators cannot run software on copy-protected media, or can run only software employing fairly simple protection schemes, unless it is &quot;[[software cracking|cracked]]&quot; (copy restrictions removed). Breaking protection on software was widely popular in the Apple II's heyday; even Apple itself apparently engaged in the practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple2history.org/2010/11/18/even-apple-used-pirate-tools/ Even Apple Used Pirate Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial cracking software such as the popular [[Copy II+]] program were sold in stores with the purpose of creating legitimate back-ups of protected software. Although creating back-ups was legitimate under copyright law of the time, the use of such software today is of questionable legality in the U.S. (see [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]). For those who prefer to obtain their old software legally, the Lost Classics Project has the goal of convincing copyright holders of classic Apple II software to officially allow unrestricted free distribution of their software and has &quot;freed&quot; a number of programs.

In addition, an active [[retrocomputing]] community of vintage Apple II collectors and users, continue to restore, maintain and develop hardware and software for daily use of these original computers. Numerous websites and support groups exist for these enthusiasts who engage in the trade and purchase for their collections, increasingly rare parts and systems. Hardly a dead platform, the Apple II has a worldwide network of kindred spirits actively engaged in preserving this otherwise outdated technology and indeed regularly attracts, new younger members who continue to keep the platform alive long after it was discontinued by Apple. There is still a small annual convention, [[KansasFest]], dedicated to the platform.

===Industry impact===
The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and on everyday life. The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw. Its price was within the reach of many middle-class families, and a partnership with [[MECC]] helped make the Apple II popular in schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;lussenhop20110119&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|title=Oregon Trail: How three Minnesotans forged its path|url=http://www.citypages.com/content/printVersion/1740595/|accessdate=2011-01-20|newspaper=City Pages|date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1980 Apple had already sold over 100,000 Apple IIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sy8vejqbcocC&amp;pg=RA1-PA19&amp;lpg=RA1-PA19&amp;dq=apple+IIe+educational+sales&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lHKYZ64tP_&amp;sig=oYJX4lOGlVH5_uUzP92z-CAyGLE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=liX4TPvmEJGcsQPj_pSlAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Essentials of Strategic Management By Charles Hill, Gareth Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity bootstrapped the [[Personal computer game|computer game]] and [[educational software]] markets and began the boom in the [[word processor]] and [[computer printer]] markets. The first microcomputer &quot;[[killer app]]&quot; for business was [[VisiCalc]], the earliest [[spreadsheet]], and it ran first on the Apple II. Many businesses bought Apple II's just to run VisiCalc. Apple's success in the home market inspired competitive [[home computer]]s such as the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] (1980) and [[Commodore 64]] (1982, with estimated sales between 17 and 25 million units). Through their significantly lower price point, these models introduced the computer to several tens of millions more home users.

The success of the Apple II in business spurred [[IBM]] to create the [[IBM PC]], which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] then transformed business again with [[local area network|LAN]] applications such as [[e-mail]] and later Internet applications such as [[Usenet]] and the [[World Wide Web|WWW]].

The first Apple II's shipped with an ''Apple II Reference Manual'' containing a complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the &quot;Monitor&quot; ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]] (later this guide had to be purchased separately, and in the case of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, the full technical documentation ran to several volumes). The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output; one hacker ([[Don Lancaster]]) used it to drive a [[LaserWriter]] printer.

The '''Apple III''' (often rendered as '''Apple ///''') is a business-oriented [[personal computer]] produced and released by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] and was intended as the successor to the [[Apple II series]], but largely considered a failure in the market.  Development work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of &quot;Sara&quot;, named after Sander's daughter.
&lt;ref name = &quot;sara&quot;&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/apple-iii-lisa-era.html Two Apple Failures: Apple III and Lisa]{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}}&lt;!-- Source uses this Wikipedia itself as a source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}} The machine was first announced and released on May 19, 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced the following autumn.&lt;ref name = &quot;intro&quot;&gt;[http://oldcomputers.net/appleiii.html Apple III computer @ oldcomputers.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Development stopped discontinued on April 24, 1984, and the III Plus was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt;

The Apple III could be viewed as an enhanced Apple II — then the newest heir to a line of [[8-bit]] machines dating back to 1976. Officially, however, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. In 1981, [[International Business Machines]] unveiled the [[IBM Personal Computer]] (IBM PC) — a completely new [[16-bit]] design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the [[PC-DOS]]/[[MS-DOS]] platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.&lt;ref name = &quot;IBMPC&quot;&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/ibm-pc-5150-origin.html The Origin of the IBM PC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous stability issues and recalls, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable and dependable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000-75,000 Apple III computers were sold.&lt;ref name = &quot;intro&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt; The Apple III Plus brought this up to ~120,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt; Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwoz&quot;&gt;[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, S. G.]] (2006), ''iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]. ISBN 0-393-06143-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple III's failure led to Apple reevaluating their plan to phase out the Apple II and eventually continued on with its development. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} and software technologies of the Apple III.

==Apple III design==
The Apple III was designed to be a business computer and an eventual successor for the Apple II. While the Apple II contributed to the inspirations of several important business products, such as [[VisiCalc]], [[Multiplan]] and [[Apple Writer]], the computer's hardware architecture, [[operating system]] and developer environment were limited.&lt;ref name = &quot;apple2hist&quot;&gt;[http://apple2history.org/history/ah07.html The Apple III Project]&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple III addressed these weaknesses.

The Apple III was powered by a 1.8 [[megahertz|MHz]] SynerTek 6502A or B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Apple Panic?&quot;|url=http://www.6502lane.net/2010/07/27/apple-panic-oh-yes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[8-bit]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] and, like some of the more advanced machines in the Apple II family, used [[bank switching]] techniques to address up to 256 KB of memory. Third-party vendors also produced memory upgrade kits that allowed the Apple III to reach up to 512 KB. Other Apple III built-in features included an 80-column display with upper and lowercase characters, a numeric keypad, dual-speed (pressure sensitive) cursor control keys, 6-bit (DAC) audio, 16-color high-resolution graphics, and a built-in 140 KB 5.25&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive. Unlike the Apple II, the Disk III controller was built into the logic board.

The Apple III was the first Apple product that allowed the user to choose both a screen font and a keyboard layout: either [[QWERTY]] or [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]]. These choices could not be changed while programs were running, unlike the [[Apple IIc]], which had a keyboard switch directly above the keyboard, allowing switching on the fly.

==Software==
A major limitation of the Apple II and DOS 3.3 was the way it addressed resources, which forced [[peripherals]] to be installed in pre-determined locations (slot 5 and 6 reserved for storage devices, slot 2 reserved for serial communication interfaces, etc.) This forced the user to identify a peripheral by its physical location, such as PR#6, CATALOG,D1, and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;beneathdos&quot;&gt;Beneath Apple DOS, Chapter 6 ''Using DOS from Assembly Language''&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple III introduced an advanced operating system called '''[[Apple SOS]]''', pronounced &quot;apple sauce&quot;. Its ability to address resources by name instead of a physical location allowed the Apple III to be more scalable. Apple SOS also allowed the full capacity of a storage device to be used as a single volume, such as the [[Apple ProFile]] hard disk drive. Also, Apple SOS supported a hierarchical file system (HFS). Some of the features and code base of Apple SOS made their way into the Apple II's [[ProDOS]] and [[GS/OS]] operating systems, as well as [[Apple Lisa|Lisa 7/7]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh system software]].

The Apple III also introduced a new [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] called [[Business BASIC|Apple III Business BASIC]], and later an implementation of [[UCSD Pascal]] for more [[structured programming]].

Originally intended as a direct replacement to the Apple II series, it was designed for backwards-compatibility of Apple II software in order to migrate users over. However, since Apple did not want to encourage continued development of the II platform, they limited its capabilities to emulate a basic 48 KB Apple II+ configuration, with no access to the III's advanced features, a restriction which actually required custom chips to enforce.

The Apple III had a System Utilities program, which allowed system reconfiguration and file manipulation. Another program, Selector III, was designed to integrate with the System Utilities program and launch various applications. However, Apple decided not to finish this project, and the engineers and writers working on the project bought the right to market Selector III to Apple III owners for a nominal fee. However, another company, [[Quark, Inc.|Quark Software]], developed a competing product, Catalyst, the cruder interface of which was offset by program-switching capabilities and support for copy-protection, which enabled companies to license users to run programs from a hard disk without worrying that their software might be backed up or copied without permission. When Apple decided to bundle Catalyst with its new [[ProFile]] hard disk, Quark celebrated, and Selector III's developers quietly dissolved their company.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Peripherals==
Several new Apple-produced peripherals were developed for the Apple III. The original Apple III came with a built-in real-time clock, which was recognized by Apple SOS. The clock was later removed from the &quot;revised&quot; and &quot;Plus&quot; models, and instead was made available as an add-on.

Along with the built-in floppy drive, the Apple III could also handle up to three additional external '''Disk III''' floppy disk drives. The [[Disk II#Disk III|Disk III]] was only officially compatible with the Apple III, although the Apple III was able to use the Apple II's modified [[Disk II]] disk drive and vice-versa.

With the introduction of the revised Apple III a year after launch Apple began offering the [[ProFile]] external hard disk system.&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot; /&gt; Costing US$3499 for 5MB, it also required a peripheral slot for the ProFile controller card.

==Revisions==
[[File:Apple III+.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Apple III Plus]]
Once the logic board design flaws were discovered, a newer logic board design was produced - which included a lower power requirement, wider traces and better designed chip sockets.&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot;&gt;[http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/computers/III.html Apple III @ bott.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The $3,495 revised model also included 256 KB RAM as a standard configuration.&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot; /&gt; The 14,000 units of the original Apple III sold were returned and replaced with the entirely new revised model.

===Apple III Plus===
The '''Apple III Plus''' was introduced in December 1983, while discontinuing the revised III model, at a price of US$2995.&lt;ref name=&quot;bott&quot; /&gt; This newer version included a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized rear port connectors, 256K RAM as standard, and a re-designed keyboard. The keyboard was designed in the style of the earlier beige [[Apple IIe]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot; /&gt;

Owners of the earlier Apple III could obtain the newer logic board as a service replacement. A keyboard upgrade kit, dubbed &quot;Apple III Plus upgrade kit&quot; was also made available - which included the keyboard, cover, keyboard encoder ROM and logo replacements. This upgrade had to be installed by an authorized service technician.

==Design flaws==
[[Steve Jobs]] insisted on the idea of no fan or air vents - in order to make the computer run quietly. Jobs would later push this same ideology onto almost all Apple models he had control of - from the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh 128K]] to the [[iMac]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onscreen-scientist.com/?tag=fan-control First Cool, Now Quiet]&lt;/ref&gt; To allow the computer to dissipate heat, the base of the Apple III was made of heavy cast aluminum, which supposedly acted as a heat sink. And, unlike the Apple II series, the power supply was stored - without its own shell - in a compartment separate from the logic board.

[[File:Apple III+ case.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Apple III Plus showing the heatsink and the cast aluminum case]]
However, many Apple III's experienced heating issues, allegedly caused by insufficient cooling and inability to dissipate the heat efficiently. To address the heat problem, later Apple III's were fitted with heat sinks. But still, the case design made it impossible for enough heat to escape. Some users stated that their Apple III became so hot that the chips started dislodging from the board, the screen would display garbled data, or their [[Floppy disk|disk]] would come out of the slot &quot;melted&quot;.  In a technical bulletin, customers who were experiencing certain problems were instructed to lift the machine {{convert|3|in|mm}} and drop it in order to re-seat the chips on the logic board.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt; [[Jerry Manock]], the case designer, refuted these case design flaw charges and maintained that the unit adequately dissipated the internal heat, which he proved with various tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7Br07QKMk Computer History Museum: Apple Industrial Designers Robert Brunner and Jerry Manock]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Manock was vindicated, as the primary culprit turned out to be a major logic board design problem. The logic board used &quot;fineline&quot; technology that was not fully mature at the time, with narrow, closely spaced traces.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;/&gt; When chips were &quot;stuffed&quot; into the board and [[Wave soldering|wave-soldered]], solder bridges would form between traces that were not supposed to be connected. This caused numerous short circuits, which required hours of costly diagnosis and hand rework to fix. Apple designed a new circuit board - with more layers and normal-width traces. The new logic board was designed by one designer on a huge drafting board, rather than a costly [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]-[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] system used for the previous board, and it worked.

Earlier Apple III units came with a built-in real time clock, manufactured by [[National Semiconductor]]. The hardware, however, would fail after prolonged use. While it was assumed that a vendor would test parts before shipping them, Apple did not perform this level of testing. Apple was soldering chips directly to boards and could not easily change out a bad chip if one was found. Eventually, Apple solved this problem by removing the real-time clock from the Apple III's specification, rather than shipping the Apple III with the clock pre-installed, and sold the peripheral as a level 1 technician add-on.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company|first=Owen W.|last=Linzmayer|isbn=1593270100|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;ots=PxDs4_6q_D&amp;pg=PA41|pages=41-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial failure==
For a variety of reasons, the Apple III was a commercial failure. With a starting price between $4,340 to $7,800 US, it was more expensive than many of the [[CP/M]]-based business computers that were available at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;avuqmb&quot;/&gt; The Apple III's software library was very limited, and while sold as Apple II compatible, the emulation that made this possible was intentionally hobbled; thus it could not make use of the advanced III features (specifically 64 KB RAM or higher, required by a large number of Apple II software titles based on PASCAL), which limited its usefulness.

==Influence==
The [[filesystem]] and some design ideas from [[Apple SOS]], the Apple III's operating system, were part of [[Apple ProDOS]] and [[Apple GS/OS]], the major operating systems for the [[Apple II series]] following the demise of the Apple III.

In [[computer science]], an '''AVL tree''' is a [[self-balancing binary search tree]], and it was the first such [[data structure]] to be invented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|Robert Sedgewick]], ''Algorithms'', Addison-Wesley, 1983, ISBN 0-201-06672-6, page 199, chapter 15: Balanced Trees.&lt;/ref&gt; In an AVL tree, the [[tree height|heights]] of the two [[child node|child]] subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take [[big O notation|O]](log ''n'') time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more [[tree rotation]]s.

The AVL tree is named after its two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] inventors, [[Georgii Adelson-Velskii|G.M. Adelson-Velskii]] and [[Yevgeniy Landis|E.M. Landis]], who published it in their 1962 paper &quot;An algorithm for the organization of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelson-Velskii|first=G.|coauthors=E. M. Landis|year=1962|title=An algorithm for the organization of information|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|volume=146|pages=263–266}} {{ru icon}} English translation by Myron J. Ricci in ''Soviet Math. Doklady'', 3:1259&amp;ndash;1263, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''balance factor''' of a node is the height of its left subtree minus the height of its right subtree (sometimes opposite) and a node with balance factor 1, 0, or −1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the heights of the subtrees.

AVL trees are often compared with [[red-black tree]]s because they support the same set of operations and because red-black trees also take [[big O notation|O]](log ''n'') time for the basic operations.  Because AVL trees are more rigidly balanced, they are faster than red-black trees for lookup intensive applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Pfaff|first = Ben|title = Performance Analysis of BSTs in System Software| publisher = [[Stanford university|Stanford University]]|year = 2004|month = June|url = http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/papers/libavl.pdf|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, red-black trees have faster insertion and removal times.

==Operations==
Basic operations of an AVL tree involve carrying out the same actions as would be carried out on an unbalanced [[binary search tree]], but modifications are preceded or followed by one or more operations called [[tree rotation]]s, which help to restore the height balance of the subtrees.

===Lookup===
Lookup in an AVL tree is performed exactly as in an unbalanced binary search tree.  Because of the height-balancing of the tree, a lookup takes O(log ''n'') time.  No special actions need to be taken, and the tree's structure is not modified by lookups.  (This is in contrast to [[splay tree]] lookups, which do modify their tree's structure.)

If each node additionally records the size of its subtree (including itself and its descendants), then the nodes can be retrieved by index in O(log ''n'') time as well.

Once a node has been found in a balanced tree, the ''next'' or ''previous'' nodes can be explored in [[amortized complexity|amortized]] constant time.  A few cases require traversing up to 2×log(''n'') links.  However exploring all n nodes in the tree in this manner would use each link exactly twice, and there are ''n''−1 links, so the amortized cost is 2×(''n''−1)/''n'', approximately 2.

===Insertion===
[[Image:AVL Tree Rebalancing.svg|thumb|350px|Pictorial description of how rotations cause rebalancing tree, and then retracing one's steps toward the root updating the balance factor of the nodes. The numbered circles represent the nodes being balanced. The lettered triangles represent subtrees which are themselves balanced BSTs]]

After inserting a node, it is necessary to check each of the node's ancestors for consistency with the rules of AVL.  For each node checked, if the balance factor remains −1, 0, or +1 then no rotations are necessary.  However, if the balance factor becomes ±2 then the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced.  If insertions are performed serially, after each insertion, at most one [[tree rotation]] is needed to restore the entire tree to the rules of AVL.

There are four cases which need to be considered, of which two are symmetric to the other two. Let P be the root of the unbalanced subtree, with R and L denoting the right and left children of P respectively.

'''Right-Right case''' and '''Right-Left case''':
If the balance factor of P is −2, then the right subtree outweighs the left subtree of the given node, and the balance factor of the right child (R) must be checked. If the balance factor of R is &lt; 0, a '''left rotation''' is needed with P as the root. If the balance factor of R is -1, a '''double left rotation''' (with respect to P and then R) is needed . If the balance factor of R is +1, two different rotations are needed. The first rotation is a right rotation with R as the root. The second is a left rotation with P as the root.

'''Left-Left case''' and '''Left-Right case''':
If the balance factor of P is +2, then the left subtree outweighs the right subtree of the given node, and the balance factor of the left child (L) must be checked. If the balance factor of L is &gt; 0, a '''right rotation''' is needed with P as the root. If the balance factor of L is +1, a '''double right rotation''' (with respect to P and then L) is needed. If the balance factor of L is -1, two different rotations are needed. The first rotation is a left rotation with L as the root. The second is a right rotation with P as the root.

===Deletion===
If the node is a leaf or has only one child, remove it.
Otherwise, replace it with either the largest in its left subtree (inorder predecessor) or the smallest in its right subtree (inorder successor), and remove that node.
The node that was found as a replacement has at most one subtree. After deletion, retrace the path back up the tree (parent of the replacement) to the root, adjusting the balance factors as needed.

As with all binary trees, a node's in-order successor is the left-most child of its right subtree, and a node's in-order predecessor is the right-most child of its left subtree. In either case, this node will have zero or one children. Delete it according to one of the two simpler cases above.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:binary search tree delete.svg|Deleting a node with two children from a binary search tree]]&lt;/center&gt;

In addition to the balancing described above for insertions, if the balance factor for the tree is 2 and that of the left subtree is 0, a right rotation must be performed on P.  The mirror of this case is also necessary.

The retracing can stop if the balance factor becomes −1 or +1 indicating that the height of that subtree has remained unchanged.
If the balance factor becomes 0 then the height of the subtree has decreased by one and the retracing needs to continue.
If the balance factor becomes −2 or +2 then the subtree is unbalanced and needs to be rotated to fix it.
If the rotation leaves the subtree's balance factor at 0 then the retracing towards the root must continue since the height of this subtree has decreased by one.
This is in contrast to an insertion where a rotation resulting in a balance factor of 0 indicated that the subtree's height has remained unchanged.

The time required is O(log ''n'') for lookup, plus a maximum of O(log ''n'') rotations on the way back to the root, so the operation can be completed in O(log ''n'') time.

==Comparison to other structures==
Both AVL trees and red-black trees are self-balancing binary search trees, so they are very similar mathematically. The operations to balance the trees are different, but both occur in O(log ''n'') time. The real difference between the two is the limiting height.
For a tree of size &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;:
*An AVL tree's height is strictly less than:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkhard|first=Walt|title=Advanced Data Structures|url=http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs100s/public/Notes/CSE100Spring2010.pdf|date=Spring 2010|publisher=[http://softreserves.ucsd.edu/ A.S. Soft Reserves], [[UC San Diego]]|location=[[La Jolla]]|page=99|chapter=AVL Dictionary Data Type Implementation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\log_\phi(n+2) - 1 = { \log_2(n+2) \over \log_2(\phi) } - 1 = \log_\phi(2) \cdot \log_2(n+2) - 1 \approx 1.44\log_2(n+2) - 1&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]].
*A [[red-black tree]]'s height is at most &lt;math&gt;2\log_2(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Red-black tree#Proof of asymptotic bounds|Proof of asymptotic bounds]]&lt;/ref&gt;

AVL trees are more rigidly balanced than [[red-black tree]]s, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval.

In [[organic chemistry]], '''aliphatic compounds''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|f|æ|t|ɨ|k}}; G. ''aleiphar'', fat, oil) are [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] or [[cyclic compound|cyclic]], non-[[Aromaticity|aromatic]] carbon compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Aliphatic compounds |file=A00217 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, aliphatic compounds are opposite to aromatic compounds.

== Structure ==

In aliphatic compounds, carbon atoms can be joined together in straight chains, branched chains, or non-aromatic rings (in which case they are called [[Alicyclic compound|alicyclic]]). Aliphatic compounds can be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], joined by single bonds ([[alkanes]]), or unsaturated, with double bonds ([[alkenes]]) or triple bonds ([[alkynes]]). Besides [[hydrogen]], other elements can be bound to the carbon chain, the most common being [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], and [[chlorine]]. 

The simplest aliphatic compound is [[methane]] ([[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Aliphatics include [[alkanes]] (''e.g.'' [[paraffin]] [[hydrocarbon]]s), [[alkene]]s (''e.g.'' [[ethylene]]) and [[alkyne]]s (''e.g.'' [[acetylene]]). [[Fatty acid]]s consist of an unbranched aliphatic tail attached to a [[carboxyl group]]. 

== Properties ==

Most aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as [[methane]] in Bunsen burners and as [[Liquified Natural Gas]] (LNG), and [[acetylene]] in welding.

== Examples for aliphatic compounds ==

The most important group of aliphatic compounds are:

* n-, Iso- and Cyclo-Alk'''an'''es (Saturated Hydrocarbons)
* n-, Iso- and Cyclo-Alk'''en'''es and -Alk'''yn'''es (Unsaturated Hydrocarbons).

Important examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):

{{Astrology}}
{{paranormal}}
'''Astrology''' is a system of [[divination]] founded on the notion that the relative positions of [[celestial bodies]] are signs of or—more controversially among astrologers—causes of [[destiny]], personality, human affairs, and natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pingree |first=David |authorlink=David Pingree |encyclopedia=The Dictionary of the History of Ideas |editor=Philip P. Wiener |title=Astrology |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;chunk.id=dv1-20 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |year=1973 |publisher=Scribner |volume=1 |location=New York |isbn=0684132931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, Simon. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion''. Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary astrological bodies are the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[planet]]s; although astrology is commonly characterized as &quot;reading the stars&quot;, the [[star]]s actually play a minor role. The main focus is on the placement of the [[seven planets]] relative to each other and to the [[astrological sign|signs of the zodiac]], though the system does allow reference to [[fixed stars]], asteroids, comets, and various mathematical points of interest as well. As a craft, astrology is a combination of basic [[astronomy]], [[numerology]], and [[mysticism]]. In its modern form, it is a classic example of [[pseudoscience]].

Historically, astrology was regarded as a technical and learned tradition, sustained in royal courts, cultural centers, and medieval universities, and closely related to the studies of [[alchemy]], [[meteorology]], and [[medicine]].  [[Astrology and astronomy]] were often synonymous before the [[modern era]], with the desire for predictive and divinatory knowledge one of the motivating factors for astronomical observation. Astronomy began to diverge from astrology in the Muslim world at the turn of the 2nd millennium, and in Europe from the [[Renaissance]] through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in 18th century. Eventually, astronomy distinguished itself as the [[empiricism|empirical]] study of celestial objects and phenomena. In the latter half of the 20th century astrology experienced a resurgence of popular interest as a major component of the [[New Age]] movement{{fact|reason=disbelief|date=May 2011}}.

[[Astrologer]]s have long debated the degree of [[determinism]] in astrology and the limits of astrology's application. Some astrologers believe the planets control fate directly, others that they determine personalities.  These positions have been criticized{{By whom|date=March 2011}} for denying [[free will]].  Many astrologers contend that there is no direct influence, only an acausal correlation between the planets and human affairs.

The [[scientific community]] bases astrology's pseudoscientific status in its making predictive claims which either cannot be [[falsifiability|falsified]] or have been consistently disproved. Astrology cannot be classified as science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural events in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartmann&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=P|coauthors=Reuter M, Nyborga H|title=The relationship between date of birth and individual differences in personality and general intelligence: A large-scale study|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2006|month=May|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1349–1362|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thagard|first=PR|title=Why Astrology is a Pseudoscience|journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|year=1978|volume=1978|pages=223–234|url=http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NSF_2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3 |title=Chapter 7: Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding |author=[[National Science Board]] |year=2006 |work=Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |at=&quot;Belief in Pseudoscience&quot; (see also Footnote 29) |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;p&gt;&quot;...[A]bout three-fourths of Americans hold at least one pseudoscientific belief; i.e., they believed in at least 1 of the 10 survey items...'''[29]'''&quot;&lt;p&gt; &quot;'''[29]''' Those 10 items were extrasensory perception (ESP), that houses can be haunted, ghosts/that spirits of dead people can come back in certain places/situations, telepathy/communication between minds without using traditional senses, clairvoyance/the power of the mind to know the past and predict the future, astrology/that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives, that people can communicate mentally with someone who has died, witches, reincarnation/the rebirth of the soul in a new body after death, and channeling/allowing a &quot;spirit-being&quot; to temporarily assume control of a body.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychology]] explains much of the continued faith in astrology as a matter of [[cognitive bias]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;asotp&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Activities With Astrology |publisher=Astronomical society of the Pacific |url= http://www.astrosociety.org/education/astro/act3/astrology3.html#defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fisa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Objections to Astrology and the Strange Case of Astrology |url=http://fisa.altervista.org/list_of_186.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rudolfhsmit.nl/u-case2.htm &quot;The case for and against astrology: end of a shouting match.&quot;] Retrieved 2009-9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Viegas.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;[[wikt:astrology|astrology]]&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] term ''[[wikt:astrologia|astrologia]]'' &quot;astronomy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astrology Astrology]''. [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]. 2001. Retrieved 24 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αστρολογία|αστρολογία]]}}, from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἄστρον|ἄστρον]]}} ''astron'' &quot;constellation&quot; or &quot;celestial body&quot; and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} ''-logia'' &quot;the study of&quot;.

The Greek words ἄστρον ''astron'' and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀστήρ|ἀστήρ]]}} ''astêr'' were both used for any point of light in the sky. The phrase {{lang|grc|πλάνητες ἀστέρες}} ''plánētes astéres'' &quot;wandering stars&quot; was applied to the [[Classical planet|seven visible planets]] (including the Sun and Moon) because of their observable movement against the [[fixed stars]]. Thus, all were 'stars' in the Classical sense, explaining the prefix ''astro-'' in both ''astrology'' and ''astronomy''.&lt;ref&gt;Nonetheless, the prefix ''astro-'' is sometimes considered problematic due to its common translation as &quot;star&quot;: &lt;br&gt;'the astrology we have developed is what can more aptly be called planetology or solarsystemology, as it is really about the relationship we have with the planets and the seasons on earth and very little to do with the dome of the starry sky. Indeed the only star that is represented in the map is Helios our sun and the planets in a horoscope are measured in one dimension in relationship to Helios' journey. Therefore, the prefix of ''astro'' which means &quot;of the stars&quot; should not really be used.' (Bernadet Brady, &quot;Fixed Stars: why bother?&quot;[http://www.skyscript.co.uk/bb1.html])&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;[[wikt:starcraft|starcraft]]&quot; has been used as a synonym for astrology, and dates from an era when the English word &quot;star&quot; also covered the planets. The term &quot;[[wikt:astromancy|astromancy]]&quot; is used specifically for the modern aspects of astrology, divination and prophecy, as opposed to the ancient astronomical aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|astromancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core beliefs and practices==
{{Hermetism}}

The core beliefs of astrology were prevalent in parts of the ancient world and are epitomized in the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] maxim, &quot;as above, so below&quot;. [[Tycho Brahe]] used a similar phrase to summarize his studies in astrology: ''suspiciendo despicio'', &quot;by looking up I see downward&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tycho Brahe and Astrology |author=Adam Mosley |url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/tychoastrol.html |accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several techniques of forecasting in Western astrology.  [[Astrological transit|Transits]], the most popular, are based on the actual motion of planets moving through a [[Astrological sign|sign]] or [[House (astrology)|house]] within the [[horoscope]].  Another technique, [[astrological progression|progressions]] are based on the movements of the planets after birth, symbolically related to a time period or cycle of life.&lt;ref&gt;Farnell, Javor &amp; Schnitzer. H, ''New Illustrated Astrology'', (Starfire, London 2002), ISBN 1-903-817-900 Transits most popular technique:p.183 Progressions:p.143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Derek &amp; Julia, Parker’s ''Astrology: The Definitive Guide to using astrology in every aspect of your life.'' (Dorling Kindersley, Covent Garden, London 1991) ISBN 1-4053-0008-6 'Though the public in particular speaks of astrologers as “predicting”, it cannot too often be emphasized that astrology cannot be relied up to predict specific events.' 'Transit: A planet’s movement through a sign or house.' p.489&lt;/ref&gt; Most Western astrologers no longer try to forecast actual events, but focus instead on general trends and developments.  Skeptics respond that this practice of western astrologers allows them to avoid making verifiable predictions, and gives them the ability to attach significance to arbitrary and unrelated events, in a way that suits their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;About.com: [http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/skepticism/blfaq_astro_sci_pseudo.htm Is Astrology a Pseudoscience? Examining the Basis and Nature of Astrology]&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, Hindu astrologers make predictions about both trends and events.

In the past, astrologers often relied on close observation of celestial objects and the charting of their movements. Modern astrologers use data provided by [[astronomer]]s which are transformed to a set of astrological tables called [[ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.zodiacnet.net/ephemeris.html Ephemeris, ZodiacNet, LexiconSite (Language: Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; showing the changing zodiacal positions of the heavenly bodies through time.

===Traditions===
{{See also|List of astrological traditions, types, and systems}}
[[Image:zodiac woodcut.png|thumb|225px|right|[[Zodiac]] signs, 16th century [[Europe]]an woodcut]]

Historically, alchemy in the [[Western World]] was particularly allied and intertwined with traditional Babylonian-Greek style astrology; in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for [[occult]] or hidden knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Weor, Samael Aun ''Astrotheurgy'', The Esoteric Treatise of Hermetic Astrology, pp. 60–117, Glorian Publishing 2006, ISBN 978-1-934206-06-5&lt;/ref&gt; Astrology has used the concept of the four [[astrology and the classical elements|classical elements]] of alchemy from antiquity up until the present day. Traditionally, each of the seven planets in the solar system known to the ancients was associated with, held dominion over, and &quot;ruled&quot; a certain metal.&lt;ref&gt;Weor, Samael Aun ''Astrotheurgy'', The Zodiacal Course, pp.3–58, Glorian Publishing, 2006, ISBN 978-1-934206-06-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horoscopic astrology===
{{Main|Horoscopic astrology}}

''Horoscopic astrology'' is a system that some claim to have developed in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region and specifically [[Hellenistic Egypt]] around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;David Pingree – ''From Astral Omens to Astrology from Babylon to Bikaner'', Roma: Istituto Italiano per L'Africa e L'Oriente, 1997. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition deals with two-dimensional diagrams of the heavens, or horoscopes, created for specific moments in time.

===Origins===
[[Image:Anatomical Man.jpg|thumb|225px|right|15th century image from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' showing projected correlations between areas of the body and the zodiacal signs.]]
Many{{who|date=February 2011}} believe that the origins of much of the astrological doctrine and method that would later develop in [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]] are found among the ancient [[Babylonians]] and their system of celestial omens that began to be compiled around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02018e.htm ''Namar Beli'' (Bel's Illumination), considered by those who do not acknowledge the antiquity of purported Vedic documents to be the oldest astrological document in the world]&lt;/ref&gt; They believe this system of celestial omens later spread, either directly or indirectly through the Babylonians and Assyrians, to other areas such as the [[Middle East]], and [[Greece]], where it merged with pre-existing indigenous forms of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra David-Neel]] ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet'', p. 290, Dover Publications Inc., 1971 ISBN 0-486-22682-4; 1st French ed. 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before the modern era===
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|right|225px|thumb|Anonymous [[Flammarion engraving]] (1888).]]

The differentiation between astronomy and astrology varied from place to place; they were strongly linked in ancient India,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathemajik.googlepages.com/astronomy.htm |title=Ancient India's Contribution to Astronomy |accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Babylonia and [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], but separated to an extent in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]]. The first [[semantics|semantic]] distinction between [[astrology and astronomy]] was probably given by [[Isidore of Seville]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Pines (September 1964), &quot;The Semantic Distinction between the Terms Astronomy and Astrology according to al-Biruni&quot;, ''Isis'' '''55''' (3): 343–349&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[astrology and astronomy]]).

Astrology was not without criticism before the modern era; it was often challenged by Hellenistic skeptics, church authorities, and medieval [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]], such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]]. Their reasons for refuting astrology were often due to both scientific (the methods used by astrologers being [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]]) and religious (conflicts with orthodox [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]]) reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Saliba |first=George |authorlink=George Saliba |year=1994b |title=A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |isbn=0814780237 |pages=60, 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350), in his ''Miftah Dar al-SaCadah'', used empirical arguments in astronomy in order to refute astrology and [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation |first=John W. |last=Livingston |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=91 |issue=1 |year=1971 |pages=96–103 |doi=10.2307/600445 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/600445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thinkers, philosophers and scientists, such as [[Galen]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Girolamo Cardan]], [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Carl Jung]] and others, practiced or significantly contributed to astrology.&lt;ref name=&quot;eysenck-nias&quot;&gt;Eysenck, H.J., Nias, D.K.B., Astrology: Science or Superstition?

===Contemporary changes===

Several innovations have occurred in contemporary astrological practice.

====Western====
{{Main|Western astrology}}

Early in the 20th century, [[Carl Jung]], the founder of analytical psychology, developed sophisticated theories concerning astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl G. ''Letters 1906-1950,'' ed. Gerhard Adler, et al.(Princeton University Press: Bollingen, 1992), Letter from Jung to Freud, 12 June 1911. ISBN 9780691098951 “I made horoscopic calculations in order to find a clue to the core of psychological truth.”&lt;/ref&gt; These included concepts such as [[archetype]]s, the [[collective unconscious]]&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas,'' A History of Western Astrology, Vol.II'' (Continuum, London 2009) p.251-256 ISBN 1441181296 “At the same time, in Switzerland, the psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) was developing sophisticated theories concerning astrology…”&lt;/ref&gt; and with the collaboration of pioneer theoretical physicist (and Nobel laureate), [[Wolfgang Pauli]],  [[synchronicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Gieser, Suzanne. ''The Innermost Kernel, Depth Psychology and Quantum Physics. Wolfgang Pauli’s Dialogue with C.G.Jung'', (Springer, Berlin, 2005) p.21 ISBN 3-540-20856-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Astrologers like [[Dane Rudhyar]]&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas. &quot;''Prophecy, Cosmology and the New Age Movement. The Extent and Nature of Contemporary Belief in Astrology.''&quot;( Bath Spa University College, 2003)  via Campion, Nicholas, ''History of Western Astrology'', (Continuum Books, London &amp; New York, 2009) p.248 p.256 ISBN 9781847252241&lt;/ref&gt; pursued a similar path to Jung and others such as [[Liz Greene]]&lt;ref&gt;Holden, James, ''A History of Horoscopic Astrology: From the Babylonian Period to the Modern Age'', (AFA 1996) p.202 ISBN 0-86690-463-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas, ''History of Western Astrology'', (Continuum Books, London &amp; New York, 2009) p.258 ISBN 9781847252241 &quot;Jungian Analyst, Liz Greene.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Arroyo]]&lt;ref&gt;Hand, Robert, ''Horoscope Symbols'' (Para Research 1981) p.349 ISBN 0-914918-16-8&lt;/ref&gt; were influenced by the Jungian model leading to the development of [[psychological astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Maggie. ''Jung and Astrology.'' (Aquarian/Harper Collins, 1992) p.105 ISBN 185538115X http://www.skyscript.co.uk/synchronicity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the middle of the 20th century, [[Alfred Witte]] and, following him, [[Reinhold Ebertin]] pioneered the use of midpoints (see [[Midpoint (astrology)|Midpoint Astrology]]) in horoscopic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, M &amp; Harvey, C, ''Working with Astrology, The Psychology of Midpoints, Harmonics and Astro*Carto*Graphy'', (Penguin Arkana 1990) (3rd edition pp.8-13) ISBN 1873948034&lt;/ref&gt;  A new kind of [[Locational Astrology]] began in 1957-58, when Donald Bradley, published a hand-plotted geographic astrology map.  In the 1970s, American astrologer [[Jim Lewis (astrologer)|Jim Lewis]] developed and popularized this technique under the name of [[Astrocartography|Astro*Carto*Graphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Martin, ''From Here to There, An Astrologer’s Guide to Astromapping'', (Wessex Astrologer, England, 2008) Ch1. History, p.2 ISBN 9781902405278&lt;/ref&gt; The world map displays lines where the Sun, Moon, planets and other celestial points appear to be on any of the [[Angle (astrology)|Four Angles]] ([[Ascendant|Rising]], [[Descendant (astrology)|Setting]], [[Midheaven|MC]] and [[Imum coeli|IC]]) at a given moment in time.  By comparing these lines with the horoscope, an astrologer attempts to identify the potential in any location.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jim &amp; Irving, Ken, ''The Psychology of Astro*Carto*Graphy'', (Penguin Arkana 1997) ISBN 1357918642&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian====
{{Main|Hindu astrology}}

Indian astrology uses a different [[zodiac]] than [[Western astrology]] and is a branch of [[Vedic science]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In countries such as India, where only a small intellectual elite has been trained in Western physics, astrology manages to retain here and there its position among the sciences.&quot; David Pingree and Robert Gilbert, &quot;Astrology; Astrology In India; Astrology in modern times&quot;.

==Effects on world culture==
{{Main|Cultural influence of astrology}}

Belief in astrology holds firm today in many parts of the world: in one poll, 31% of [[United States|Americans]] expressed a belief in astrology and, according to another study, 39% considered it scientific.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Religious and Other Beliefs of Americans 2003 |author=Humphrey Taylor |url= http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=359 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsa1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding |publisher=National Science Foundation |url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology has had an influence on both language and literature. For example, [[influenza]], from medieval Latin ''influentia'' meaning influence, was so named because doctors once believed epidemics to be caused by unfavorable planetary and stellar influences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=influenza Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;disaster&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;δυσαστρία&quot;,&quot;disastria&quot;, derived from the negative prefix &quot;δυσ-&quot; &quot;dis-&quot; and &quot;αστήρ&quot; &quot;aster&quot; &quot;star&quot;, thus meaning &quot;no-starred&quot; or &quot;badly-starred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xhmikos.gr/ZOLWTAS-ELLHNIKA-AGGLIKA.pdf|title= Ελληνικές λέξεις στην αγγλική|author= Ζωλότας Ξενοφών|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectives &quot;lunatic&quot; (Luna/[[Moon]]), &quot;mercurial&quot; ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), &quot;venereal&quot; ([[Venus]]), &quot;martial&quot; ([[Mars]]), &quot;jovial&quot; ([[Jupiter]]/Jove), and &quot;saturnine&quot; ([[Saturn]]) are all old words used to describe personal qualities said to resemble or be highly influenced by the astrological characteristics of the planet, some of which are derived from the attributes of the ancient Roman gods they are named after. In literature, many writers, notably [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Astrology and English literature |author=A.

More recently, Michael Ward has proposed that [[C.S. Lewis]] imbued his ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' with the characteristics and symbols of the seven heavens. Often, an understanding of astrological symbolism is needed to fully appreciate such literature.

Some modern thinkers, notably Carl Jung,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung&quot;&gt;Carl G. Jung, &quot;Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious,&quot; excerpted in ''The Basic Writings of C.G. Jung'' (Modern Library, repr. 1993), 362–363.&lt;/ref&gt; believe in astrology's descriptive powers regarding the mind without necessarily subscribing to its predictive claims. In music the best known example of astrology's influence is in the orchestral suite called &quot;[[The Planets]]&quot; by the British composer [[Gustav Holst]], the framework of which is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas.:''A History of Western Astrology: Volume II: The Medieval and Modern Worlds''. (Continuum Books, 2009) pp.244-245 ISBN 978-1-84725-224-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrology and science==
In the Islamic world astrology was rejected during the turn of the second millennium owing to the development of the scientific method and the work of al-Farabi, Alhacen, al-Biruni, Avicenna and Averroes, who made a semantic distinction between astronomy and astrology&lt;ref&gt;S. Pines (September 1964). &quot;The Semantic Distinction between the Terms Astronomy and Astrology according to al-Biruni&quot;, ''Isis'' '''55''' (3): 343–349.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to render astrology [[Superseded scientific theories#Obsolete branches of enquiry|obsolete]] for Muslims. [[Muslim views on astrology]] have generally remained negative.

By the time of [[Francis Bacon]] and the [[scientific revolution]], newly emerging scientific disciplines acquired a method of systematic empirical induction based upon experimental observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The scientific revolution |url=http://www.wsu.edu:8001/~dee/ENLIGHT/SCIREV.HTM |author=Hooker, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, astrology and astronomy began to diverge; astronomy became regarded as one of the empirical sciences, while astrology came to be understood as a part of scholastic [[metaphysics]], and was increasingly viewed as an occult science or superstition by natural scientists. For example, [[Christiaan Huygens]] wrote in his ''Cosmotheoros'': &quot;And as for the Judicial Astrology, that pretends to foretel what is to come, it is such a ridiculous, and oftentimes mischievous Folly, that I do not think it fit to be so much as named.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, Christiaan, ''Cosmotheoros'' p. 68 of the English translation&lt;/ref&gt; This separation accelerated through the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tester&quot;&gt;Jim Tester, ''A History of Western Astrology'' (Ballantine Books, 1989), 240ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]], regard astrology as unscientific,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Real Romance in the Stars |author=Richard Dawkins |publisher=The Independent, December 1995 |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1995-12romance_in_stars.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those such as [[Andrew Fraknoi]] of the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] have labeled it a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Astronomical Pseudo-Science: A Skeptic's Resource List |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/pseudobib.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a lecture in 2001, [[Stephen Hawking]] stated &quot;The reason most scientists don't believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=British Physicist Debunks Astrology in Indian Lecture |publisher=Associated Press |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/63/story_6346_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[American Humanist Association]] characterized those who have faith in astrology as doing so &quot;in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanist&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Objections to Astrology: A Statement by 186 Leading Scientists |publisher=The Humanist, September/October 1975 |url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/astrology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] was unwilling to sign the statement, not because he felt astrology was valid, but because he found the statement's tone [[authoritarian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan&quot;&gt;Sagan, Carl. &quot;Letter.&quot; The Humanist 36 (1976): 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Astrology: What it is and what it isn't |author=Mariapaula Karadimas |publisher=The Peak Publications Society |url=http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue7/fe-astro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan stated that he would instead have been willing to sign a statement describing and refuting the principal tenets of astrological belief, which he believed would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy than the circulated statement.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. ''The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1996), 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Astrophysicist]] [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] asserted that &quot;astrology was discredited 600 years ago with the birth of modern [[science]]. 'To teach it as though you are contributing to the fundamental knowledge of an informed electorate is astonishing in this, the 21st century'. Education should be about knowing how to think, 'And part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you{{'&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntskeptics.org/news/news2001-09-02.htm

===Research===
[[Image:Mars effect.svg|thumb|225px|right|The [[Mars effect]]: relative frequency of the [[diurnal motion|diurnal position]] of Mars in the birth chart of &quot;eminent athletes&quot;{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} (after [[Michel Gauquelin]] 1991{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}).]]
Although astrology has not been considered a science for some time, it has been the subject of considerable research by astrologers since the beginning of the 20th century.

Studies have repeatedly failed to demonstrate [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] relationships between astrological predictions and [[operational definition|operationally defined]] outcomes.&lt;ref name=asotp/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doubleblind&quot;&gt;Shawn Carlson ''A Double-blind Test of Astrology'' Nature, 318, 419 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effect size]] tests of astrology-based [[hypotheses]] conclude that the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] accuracy of astrological predictions is no greater than what is expected by chance.  It has been suggested that statistical research is often wrongly seen as evidence for astrology due to uncontrolled [[artifact (observational)|artifacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Artifacts in data often wrongly seen as evidence for astrology |url=http://www.rudolfhsmit.nl/d-arti2.htm |last=Dean |first=Geoffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychologist and statistician who devoted his life to the attempt to demonstrate the validity of certain fundamentals of astrology, [[Michel Gauquelin]], wrote that he had found correlations between some planetary positions and certain human traits such as vocations.&lt;ref&gt;Gauquelin M., ''Cosmic Influences on Human Behavior'', Aurora Press, Santa Fe NM (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Gauquelin's most widely known concept is the [[Mars effect]], which denotes a correlation between the planet Mars occupying certain positions in the sky more often at the birth of eminent sports champions than at the birth of ordinary people. A similar idea is explored by [[Richard Tarnas]] in his work ''Cosmos and Psyche'', in which he examines correspondences between planetary alignments and historically significant events and individuals. Since its original publication in 1955, the Mars effect has been the subject of critical studies and [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] publications which aim to refute it,&lt;ref&gt;Benski, C. et al. 1996. The &quot;Mars Effect&quot;: A French Test of Over 1000 Sports Champions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zelen, M., P. Kurtz, and G. Abell. 1977. Is there a Mars effect? The Humanist 37 (6): 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Neisler in ''Skeptical — a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, ISBN 0731657942, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and of studies in [[fringe science|fringe journals]] used to support or expand the original ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Suitbert Ertel |title=Raising the Hurdle for the Athletes' Mars Effect: Association Co-Varies With Eminence |url=http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_02_1_ertel.pdf |journal=Journal of Scientific Exploration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Discussion of Mars eminence effect |author= Ken Irving |url=http://www.planetos.info/mmf.html |publisher=Planetos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauquelin's research has not received mainstream scientific notice.

In their study of 20th-century research into [[natal astrology]], Geoffrey Dean, a former astrologer who became critical of the field, and his coauthors documented the burgeoning research activity performed primarily within the astrological community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;&gt;G. Dean et al., ''Recent Advances in Natal Astrology: A Critical Review 1900-1976''. The Astrological Association (England 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obstacles to research===
Astrologers have argued that there are significant obstacles in carrying out scientific research into astrology today, including lack of funding,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eysenck&quot;&gt;H.J. Eysenck &amp; D.K.B. Nias, ''Astrology: Science or Superstition?'' Penguin Books (1982) ISBN 0-14-022397-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillipson&quot;&gt;G. Phillipson, ''Astrology in the Year Zero''. Flare Publications (London, 2000) ISBN 0-9530261-9-1&lt;/ref&gt; lack of background in science and statistics by astrologers, and insufficient expertise in astrology by research scientists and skeptics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eysenck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillipson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Prejudice in Astrological Research |author=M. Harding |publisher=Correlation, Vol 19(1) |url=http://www.astrozero.co.uk/astroscience/harding.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some astrologers have argued that few practitioners today pursue scientific testing of astrology because they feel that working with clients on a daily basis provides personal validation for their clients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillipson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irving&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Science, Astrology and the Gauquelin Planetary Effects |author=K. Irving |url=http://www.planetos.info/sciast1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument made by astrologers is that most studies of astrology do not reflect the nature of astrological practice and that the [[scientific method]] does not apply to astrology.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;MUL-MVA&quot;&gt;M. Urban-Lurain, ''Introduction to Multivariate Analysis'', Astrological Research Methods, Volume 1: An ISAR Anthology.

From Paradigm to Method in Astrological Research'', Astrological Research Methods, Volume 1: An ISAR Anthology. International Society for Astrological Research (Los Angeles 1995) ISBN 0-9646366-0-3&lt;/ref&gt; Some astrology proponents argue that the prevailing attitudes or motives of many opponents of astrology introduce conscious or unconscious bias in the formulation of hypotheses to be tested, the conduct of the tests, or the reporting of results.&lt;ref name=&quot;asotp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=eysenck-nias/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;humanist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Astrology for Skeptics |author=Bob Marks |url=http://www.bobmarksastrologer.com/skeptics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanisms===
Astrologers have not presented consistent explanations of physical mechanisms underlying astrological beliefs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Seymour&quot;&gt;Dr. P. Seymour, ''Astrology: The evidence of Science.'' Penguin Group (London, 1988) ISBN 0-14-019226-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Pineal Gland and the Ancient Art of Iatromathematica |author=Frank McGillion |url=http://www.astrology-research.net/researchlibrary/Iatr/pineal.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and few modern astrologers believe in a direct causal relationship between heavenly bodies and earthly events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillipson&quot;/&gt; An editorial published by the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] reports no evidence for a scientifically defined mechanism by which celestial objects can influence terrestrial affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;asotp&quot;/&gt; Researchers have posited [[acausal]], purely [[correlative]], relationships between astrological observations and events, such as the theory of [[synchronicity]] proposed by [[Carl Jung]].{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Hyde, Jung and Astrology. The Aquarian Press (London, 1992) p. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have posited a basis in [[divination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornelius&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Cornelius, The Moment of Astrology. Utsav Arora, another meditation research specialist and astrologer, argues, &quot;if 100% accuracy were to be the benchmark, we should be closing down and shutting all hospitals, medical labs. Scientific medical equipment and drugs have a long history of errors and miscalculations. Same is the case with computers and electronic. We don't refute electronic gadgets and equipment just because it fails but we work towards finding cures for the errors.&quot; The Wessex Astrologer (Bournemouth, 2003.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other astrologers have argued that empirical correlations stand on their own [[epistemology|epistemologically]], and do not need the support of any theory or mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;/&gt;

To some observers, and most astrologers, non-mechanistic concepts raise serious questions about the feasibility of validating astrology through scientific testing, and some have gone so far as to reject the applicability of the scientific method to astrology entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;/&gt; A minority of astrologers believe that astrology is amenable to the scientific method, given sufficiently sophisticated analytical methods, and cite pilot studies to support this view.&lt;ref name=&quot;HARASTRES&quot;&gt;D. Cochrane, ''Towards a Proof of Astrology: An AstroSignature for Mathematical Ability'' International Astrologer ISAR Journal Winter-Spring 2005, Vol 33, #2&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, several astrologers have called for or advocated continuing studies of astrology based on statistical validation.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Astrological education==
Education in astrology is offered both in India, where it plays a strong role in popular culture, and elsewhere.

===US and UK===
In the United States, Astrological education is offered at institutions such as [[Kepler College]], a liberal arts college with an emphasis on astrology in Lynnwood, Washington, near Seattle, which opened in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClure|first=Robert|title=Astrology school sets off controversy|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/32348_astrology23.shtml|accessdate=March 26, 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=July 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and awarded its first 8 Bachelor of Arts degrees in Astrological Studies in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kepler College First Graduation, October 10, 2004|url=http://www.stariq.com/pagetemplate/article.asp?PageID=5789|publisher=StarIQ.Com|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students attending Kepler College after March 9, 2010, however, unless they are completing a course of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree-Granting Authorization|url=http://www.kepler.edu/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17:kepler-college-authorization&amp;catid=38:about-kepler-college&amp;Itemid=153|publisher=Kepler College|accessdate=March 26, 2011|quote=Kepler College Authorization Degree-Granting Authorization  Kepler College is authorized by the Washington Higher Education Coordinating Board and through March 9, 2010, the College met the requirements and minimum standards established for degree-granting institutions under the Degree Authorization Act.

===India===
In February, 2001, the science of vedic astrology, Jyotir Vigyan, was introduced into the curriculum of Indian universities. Undergraduate (called &quot;graduate&quot; in India) post-graduate and research courses of study were established, &quot;Beneficiaries of these courses would be students, teachers, professionals from modern streams like doctors, architects, marketing, financial, economic and political analysts, etc.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UGC&quot;/&gt; In April, 2001 the Andhra Pradesh High Court declined to consider a petition to overturn the curriculum guideline on the ground that astrology was a pseudoscience, a decision affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2004 which declined as a matter of law to interfere with educational policy. The court noted that astrology studies were optional and that courses in astrology were offered by institutions of higher education in other countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;Indian Supreme Court&quot;&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/05/06/stories/2004050602931400.htm &quot;Introduction of Vedic astrology courses in varsities upheld.&quot;] ''[[The Hindu]]'', May 06, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], a [[field extension]] ''L''/''K'' is called '''algebraic''' if every element of ''L'' is [[algebraic element|algebraic]] over ''K'', i.e. if every element of ''L'' is a [[root of a function|root]] of some non-zero [[polynomial]] with coefficients in ''K''. Field extensions which are not algebraic, i.e. which contain [[transcendental element]]s, are called '''transcendental'''.

For example, the field extension '''R'''/'''Q''', that is the field of [[real number]]s as an extension of the field of [[rational number]]s, is transcendental, while the field extensions '''C'''/'''R''' and '''Q'''(√2)/'''Q''' are algebraic, where '''C''' is the field of [[complex number]]s.

All transcendental extensions are of [[degree of a field extension|infinite degree]]. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.&lt;ref&gt;See also Hazewinkel et. al. (2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all [[algebraic number]]s is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

If ''a'' is algebraic over ''K'', then ''K''[''a''], the set of all polynomials in ''a'' with coefficients in ''K'', is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of ''K'' which has finite degree over ''K''. In the special case where ''K'' = '''Q''' is the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]], '''Q'''[''a''] is an example of an [[algebraic number field]].

A field with no proper algebraic extensions is called [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. An example is the field of [[complex number]]s. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its [[algebraic closure]]), but proving this in general requires some form of the [[axiom of choice]].

An extension ''L''/''K'' is algebraic [[if and only if]] every sub ''K''-algebra of ''L'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

==Generalizations==
{{Main|Substructure}}
[[Model theory]] generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of ''M'' into ''N'' is called an '''algebraic extension''' if for every ''x'' in ''N'' there is a formula ''p'' with parameters in ''M'', such that ''p''(''x'') is true and the set

:{''y'' in ''N'' | ''p''(''y'')}

is finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The [[Galois group]] of ''N'' over ''M'' can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.

==Biography==
DiFranco was born in [[Buffalo, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebritybabynamesblog.com/2007/01/24/baby-girl-for-rock-musician-ani-difranco/ Celebritybabynamesblog.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to Elizabeth and Dante, who met while they attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003709/Ani-DiFranco.html Ani DiFranco Biography - Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/dante/index.asp Dante Americo DiFranco Memorial Page]&lt;/ref&gt;  She started playing [[The Beatles|Beatles]] covers at local bars and [[busking]] with her guitar teacher, Michael Meldrum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/store/prod_albums.asp?id=473 Notes on the album ''Open Ended Question'']&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of nine.

In 1989, DiFranco started her own record company, Righteous Records (renamed [[Righteous Babe Records]] in 1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;MilwaukeeJS2006&quot;/&gt; Prior to the renaming of Righteous Records to Righteous Babe Records, DiFranco worked with manager Dale Anderson, a writer for the ''[[Buffalo News]]'', who started another record label called Hot Wings Records after the two parted ways. Hot Wings released the work of Buffalo area female musical performers with styles similar to that of DiFranco. Early releases of her CDs produced prior to 1994 are labeled with the original Righteous Records label. Her [[Ani DiFranco (album)|self-titled debut album]] was issued on the label in the winter of 1990. Later, she relocated to [[New York, New York|New York City]], where she took [[poetry]] classes at [[The New School]] and [[Concert tour|toured]] vigorously.

DiFranco identifies herself as [[bisexual]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/112004/anidifranco.html Ani DiFranco, Folksinger and Entrepreneur] by Kris Scott Marti, November 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_n748/ai_20088650 Find articles.com], by Achy Obejas, The Advocate, December 9, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and has written songs about love and sex with women and men.  She addressed the controversy about her sexuality with the song &quot;In or Out&quot;. In 1998, she married [[sound engineer]] Andrew Gilchrist in a [[Unitarian Universalist]] service in [[Canada]], overseen by renowned folk singer [[Utah Phillips]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Numerous media sources reported that her fans felt betrayed by her union with a man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotpoetry.com/News/article/sid=119.html Biography of Ani DiFranco on gotpoetry.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  DiFranco and Gilchrist divorced five years later.

In 1998, DiFranco's drummer, [[Andy Stochansky]], left the band to pursue a solo career as a singer-songwriter. Their [[rapport]] during live shows is showcased on the 1997 album ''[[Living in Clip]]''.

DiFranco's father died early in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/reprieve/reviews.asp &quot;Still Fighting&quot;] Review in Paste.  September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, DiFranco developed [[tendinitis]] and took a hiatus from touring. DiFranco had toured almost continuously in the preceding fifteen years, only taking brief breaks to record [[studio album]]s. Her 2005 tour concluded with an appearance at the [[FloydFest]] [[World Music]] and Genre [[Crossover (music)|Crossover]] festival in [[Floyd, Virginia]]. DiFranco returned to touring in late April 2006, including a performance at the [[New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival]] on April 28 and a performance at the renowned Calgary Folk Music Festival on July 30, 2006.

DiFranco gave birth to a daughter, Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrity-babies.com/2007/07/introducing-pet.html &quot;Introducing Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano&quot;] Celebrity Baby Blog.

She has continued touring into 2008 with a backing band consisting of [[Todd Sickafoose]] on upright bass, [[Allison Miller (drummer)|Allison Miller]] on drums, and [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Mike Dillon]] on percussion and vibes. DiFranco returned to the Calgary Folk Music Festival in July 2008.

==Recognition==
On July 21, 2006, DiFranco received the [[Woman of Courage Award Winners|&quot;Woman of Courage Award&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/07/21/late-news-ani-difranco-adam-green-chris-cornell-lily-allen-janet-jackson/ Rolling Stone news]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]] Conference and Young Feminist Summit in [[Albany, New York]]. Past winners have included singer and actress [[Barbra Streisand]] and Sen. [[Barbara Boxer]], [[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-[[California|Calif.]]  DiFranco is one of the first musicians to receive the award, given each year to a woman who has set herself apart by her contributions to the feminist movement.

DiFranco has been toasted by the ''Buffalo News'' as the &quot;Buffalo's leading lady of rock music.&quot; The ''News'' further said:&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &quot;Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from [[abortion rights]] to [[Gay (term)|gay]] visibility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Owen | last=Hearey | coauthors= | title='Righteous Babe' announces she is pregnant | date=2006-07-22 | publisher= | url =http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:BNWB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1130D77E50D232B8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 | work =Buffalo News | pages =D1 | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Starting in 2003, DiFranco was nominated four consecutive times for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Recording Package]] at the [[Grammy Awards]], one of which she won, in [[46th Grammy Awards|2004]], for ''[[Evolve (album)|Evolve]]''.

==Musical style and the &quot;folk&quot; label==
DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature [[staccato]] style,&lt;ref&gt;[http://folkmusic.about.com/od/artistsaz/p/AniD_profile.htm Facts about Ani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/06.11/revani.html Ani DiFranco, Living in Clip by Jon Steltenpohl]&lt;/ref&gt; rapid [[fingerpicking]] and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include [[alliteration]], [[metaphor]], [[word play]] and a more or less gentle [[irony]], have also received praise for their sophistication.

Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both [[folk rock]] and [[alternative rock]], she has reached across genres since her earliest albums. DiFranco has collaborated with a wide range of artists including musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who recorded two songs with DiFranco in 1999 (&quot;Providence&quot; on her ''[[To the Teeth]]'' album, and &quot;I Love U, but I Don't Trust U Anymore&quot; on Prince's ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' album); folk musician and social activist [[Utah Phillips]] (on ''The Past Didn't Go Anywhere'' in 1996 and ''Fellow Workers'' in 1999); [[funk]] and [[soul jazz]] musician [[Maceo Parker]]; and [[rapping|rapper]] [[Corey Parker (singer)|Corey Parker]]. She has used a variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and styles: [[brass instrument]]ation was prevalent in 1998's ''[[Little Plastic Castle]]''; a simple [[walking bass]] in her 1997 cover of [[Hal David]] and [[Burt Bacharach]]'s &quot;[[Wishin' and Hopin']]&quot;; [[string instrument|strings]] on the 1997 live album ''[[Living in Clip]]'' and 2004's ''[[Knuckle Down]]''; and electronics and [[synthesiser]]s in 1999's ''To the Teeth'' and 2006's ''[[Reprieve (album)|Reprieve]]''.  Samples from the track &quot;Coming Up&quot; were used by [[DJ Spooky]] in his album Live Without Dead Time, produced for [[AdBusters]] Magazine in 2003.

DiFranco herself noted that &quot;folk music is not an acoustic guitar — that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to [[punk music]] and [[rap music]]. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreypepperrodgers.com/difranco.htm Rock Troubadours] by Jeffrey Pepper Rodgers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics, politics and religion==
Although much of DiFranco's material is autobiographical, it is often also strongly political. Many of her songs are concerned with contemporary social issues such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[sexual abuse]], [[homophobia]], [[reproductive rights]], [[poverty]], and [[war]]. The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]], some of whom set up fan pages on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact and word of mouth rather than [[mainstream media]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], she actively supported and voted for [[Green Party (US)|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;HackWriters.com article: &quot;[http://www.hackwriters.com/difranco04.htm Ani DiFranco interview]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine article: &quot;[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5925399/eddie_vedder_patti_smith_go_green_at_nyc_nader_rally/print Eddie Vedder, Patti Smith Go Green at NYC Nader Rally - Nader rally draws Vedder, DiFranco to Madison Square Garden]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salon.com article: &quot;[http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/11/06/letters/index1.html The Nader Letters]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; She supported [[Dennis Kucinich]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004]] and [[2008 Democratic primaries]]. Kucinich appeared with her at a number of concerts across the country during both primary seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiFranco went on to perform at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].

Early in her career, DiFranco considered herself an [[atheist]]. On the subject of religion, DiFranco has stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Well, I'm not a religious person myself. I'm an atheist. I think religion serves a lot of different purposes in people's lives, and I can recognize the value of that, you know, the value of ceremony, the value of community, or even just having a forum to get together and talk about ideas, about morals — that's a cool concept. But then, of course, institutional religions are so problematic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since becoming a mother and releasing her ''Red Letter Year'' album in 2009, DiFranco has talked in concert about &quot;finding religion&quot;. At concerts she has stated that her song &quot;The Atom&quot; is an &quot;alternative Christian proposal&quot;.  In &quot;The Atom&quot; she sings ”Oh holy is the atom/ The truly intelligent design/ To which all of evolution/ Is graciously aligned.”  In Reno in 2008 prior to singing &quot;The Atom&quot;, she said &quot;I've kind of gotten religion lately, I took a sweet religion, one I am sort of familiar with and sprayed a can of patriarchy-off and this is what I came up with.&quot;

Ani has also appeared as herself as part of a new wave of protest music sweeping across America in music documentary [[Sounds Like A Revolution|Sounds Like a Revolution]].

Ani is also a poet and has been featured on Def Jam's poetry hour.

==Label independence==
Ownership of [[Righteous Babe Records]] allows DiFranco a great deal of artistic freedom.  For example, on her 2004 album ''[[Educated Guess]]'', DiFranco played all of the instruments, provided all of the vocals, and recorded the album by herself at her home on an analog 8-track [[reel to reel]]. She was also involved in much of the artwork and design for the packaging.  The only other person involved in the record's musical production was Greg Calbi, who mastered it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/educated_guess/more_info.asp Educated guess article]&lt;/ref&gt;

References to her independence from major labels appear occasionally in DiFranco's songs, including &quot;The Million You Never Made&quot; (''[[Not A Pretty Girl]]''), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; (''[[Not So Soft]]''), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and &quot;Napoleon&quot; (''[[Dilate (Ani DiFranco album)|Dilate]]''), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.

DiFranco has occasionally joined with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. Righteous Babe Records employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo.  In a 1997 open letter to ''[[Ms. magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~marg/ani/letter.html Interview with Ms. Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success.

==Recent work==
DiFranco performed a live webcast from [[Ex'pression College for Digital Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeallies.com/more/expression-ani-difranco Creativeallies.com]&lt;/ref&gt; on June 24, 2010. She debuted a selection of new material, including the songs &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; (a reworking of the Florence Reece song with different lyrics penned by DiFranco), &quot;Life Boat&quot;, &quot;Unworry&quot;, &quot;Promiscuity&quot;, &quot;Splinter&quot;, &quot;Amendment&quot;, &quot;See See...&quot; and &quot;Hearse&quot;.

''[[Red Letter Year]]'' was released on September 30, 2008. Says DiFranco about the album: &lt;blockquote&gt;
“When I listen to my new record, I hear a very relaxed me, which I think has been absent in a lot of my recorded canon.  Now I feel like I’m in a really good place. My partner Mike Napolitano co-produced this record – my guitar and voice have never sounded better, and that’s because of him. I’ve got this great band and crew. And my baby, she teaches me how to just be in my skin, to do less and be more.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shock.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&amp;id=914 ''Shock Records''],  &quot;Ani DiFranco to Release New Album Red Letters&quot;. Retrieved on 08-15-08&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 11, 2007, she released the first retrospective of her career, titled ''[[Canon (album)|Canon]]'' and for the first time, a collection of poetry in a book titled ''Verses''.

DiFranco's album ''[[Reprieve (album)|Reprieve]]'' was released on August 8, 2006. It was previously leaked on [[iTunes]] for several hours around July 1, 2006, due to an error saying it was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6042/168/1600/itunes.0.jpg [[iTunes]] Mislabeled Release Date as 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  DiFranco performed with [[Cyndi Lauper]] on &quot;Sisters of Avalon&quot;, a track from Lauper's 2005 collection ''[[The Body Acoustic]]''.

She also collaborated with fellow [[folk singer]] [[Dar Williams]] on &quot;[[Comfortably Numb]]&quot;, a [[Pink Floyd]] cover song from Williams' 2005 album, ''[[My Better Self]]''.

In 2002 her rendition of [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]]'s &quot;The Poet Game&quot; appeared on ''Going Driftless: An Artists' Tribute to Greg Brown''.

==Lawsuit against Necro==
In 2010, DiFranco sued [[hip-hop]] [[horrorcore]] artist [[Ron Braunstein|Necro]] for sampling her song, &quot;Used to You&quot; in a response track called &quot;The Asshole Anthem&quot; on his [[DIE!]] album.  Due to the lawsuit, the album had to be reissued without the track. &lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenix.com/boston/music/109411-necro-horror-business/ Necro: Horror Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arizona Diamondbacks''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. They play in the [[National League West|West Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]]. From 1998 to the present, they have played in [[Chase Field]] (formerly Bank One Ballpark). Also known as the '''D'Backs,''' Arizona has one [[World Series]] title, in 2001, becoming the fastest expansion team in the majors to win a championship, doing it in only the fourth season since their expansion in 1998.

==Franchise history==
===The desire for baseball in the desert===
Between 1940 and 1990, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] jumped from the 99th [[Largest cities in the US|largest city]] in the nation to the 9th largest (it is currently the 6th largest). As such, it was frequently mentioned as a possible location for either a new or relocated MLB franchise. Baseball had a rich tradition in Arizona long before talk of bringing a big-league team even started. The state has been a frequent [[spring training]] site since 1946. With a large number of people relocating to the state from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], as well as from California, many teams (most notably the [[Chicago Cubs]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]) have normally had large followings in Arizona.

The first serious attempt to land an expansion team for the Phoenix area was mounted by Elyse Doherty and Martin Stone, owner of the [[Phoenix Firebirds]], the city's [[Minor league baseball#Today's Farm System|triple-A minor league baseball]] team and the top affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]]. In the late 1980s Stone approached [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis (football) Cardinals]] owner [[Bill Bidwill]] about sharing a proposed 70,000 seat domed stadium in Phoenix. It was taken for granted that a domed stadium was a must for a major-league team to be a viable venture in the Phoenix area. Phoenix is by far the hottest major city in North America; the average high temperature during baseball's regular season is 99.1 [[Fahrenheit|°F]], and game-time temperatures well above 100&amp;nbsp;°F are very common during the summer. The game-time temperature has topped 120&amp;nbsp;°F in July and August three times since the Diamondbacks' inception.

Bidwill, with plans already in the works to leave St. Louis, opted instead to sign a long term lease with [[Arizona State University]] to use its [[Sun Devil Stadium]] as the home of his soon-to-be Arizona-based NFL franchise. Since baseball-only stadiums were not seen as fiscally viable during that era, this effectively ended Stone's bid.

In the fall of 1993, [[Jerry Colangelo]], majority owner of the [[Phoenix Suns]], the area's [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] franchise, announced he was assembling an ownership group, &quot;Arizona Baseball, Inc.,&quot; to apply for a Major League Baseball expansion team. This was after a great deal of lobbying by the Maricopa County Sports Authority, a local group formed to preserve [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] in Arizona and eventually secure a Major League franchise for the state.

Colangelo's group was so certain that they would be awarded a franchise that they held a name-the-team contest for it; they took out a full-page ad in the sports section of the February 13, 1995 edition of the state's leading newspaper, the ''[[Arizona Republic]]''. First prize was a pair of lifetime season tickets awarded to the person who submitted the winning entry. The winning choice was &quot;Diamondbacks,&quot; after the [[Western diamondback]], a [[rattlesnake]] native to the region known for injecting a large amount of [[venom]] when it strikes.

Colangelo's bid received strong support from one of his friends, [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], and media reports say that then-acting [[Commissioner of Baseball]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] founder [[Bud Selig]] was also a strong supporter of Colangelo's bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;azstarnet1&quot;&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/33312 AZStarNet.com]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were also made for a new retractable-roof ballpark, Bank One Ballpark, nicknamed the BOB, (renamed in 2005 to [[Chase Field]]) to be built in an industrial/warehouse district on the southeast edge of downtown Phoenix, across the street from the Suns' America West Arena (now [[US Airways Center]]).

On March 9, 1995, Colangelo's group was [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|awarded a franchise]] to begin play for the 1998 season. A $130&amp;nbsp;million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball. The [[Tampa Bay Area]] was also granted a franchise, the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Devil Rays]] (to be based in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]), at the same time.

According to the original press release from Colangelo's group (which remained posted on the team website during the first few seasons) the chosen team colors were Arizona [[turquoise]], [[copper]], black and purple. &quot;...Turquoise was chosen because the greenish-blue stone is indigenous to Arizona, copper because Arizona is one the nation's top copper-producing states and purple because it has become a favorite color for Arizona sports fans, thanks to the success of the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azdiamondbacks.com/newswire/press/03-09-95.html|title=AZDiamondbacks.com: First press release from Diamondbacks organization, March 9, 1995, announcing MLB's awarding of the franchise to Jerry Colangelo|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=|accessdate=2010-09-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19980507160654/http://azdiamondbacks.com/newswire/press/03-09-95.html|archivedate=May 7, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest days, the Diamondbacks operated basically as a subsidiary of the Suns; several executives and managers with the Suns and America West Arena were brought over to the Diamondbacks in similar roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/1998/03/30/story3.html?t=printable|title=Challenges just starting for D'Backs– The Business Journal of Phoenix:|publisher=Phoenix.bizjournals.com|date=1998-03-27|accessdate=2010-09-07|first=Ilana|last=Ruber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A regional team===
From the beginning, Colangelo wanted to market the Diamondbacks to a statewide fan base and not limit fan appeal to Phoenix and its suburbs. Although every Major League Baseball team cultivates fans from outside its immediate metropolitan area, and even though the greater Phoenix area has 2/3 of the statewide population, Colangelo still decided to call the team the &quot;Arizona Diamondbacks&quot; rather than the &quot;Phoenix Diamondbacks&quot;. Many{{who|date=May 2011}} in Phoenix were not pleased by this, feeling it short-shrifted the metropolitan area's reputation and standing as a major league market, lending a misleading &quot;small market&quot; tincture to the organization.

A series of team-sponsored fan motorcoach trips from Tucson to Bank One Ballpark were inaugurated for the opening season and are still in operation to this day (it is now known as the &quot;Diamond Express&quot;). The Diamondbacks are also known for the &quot;Hometown Tour&quot;, held in January, where selected players, management and broadcasters make public appearances, hold autograph signings, etc., in various locations around Phoenix and Tucson, as well as many small and mid-sized towns in other areas of Arizona.

Despite their avowed claim to appeal to the entire state, in 2009 the Diamondbacks moved their Triple-A Pacific Coast League farm team, the Tucson Sidewinders, to Reno, where they are now known as the Aces.  In 2011, they also moved their spring training base from Tucson to a new stadium near the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale.

===Further preparations===
Two years before their first opening day, Colangelo hired [[Buck Showalter]], the American League [[Manager of the Year]] in 1994 with the [[New York Yankees]].

Their lower level [[Minor League Baseball]] teams began play in 1997; the [[1997 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]] was held that year as well.

===1998–2002: Early success and a World Series championship===
The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on March 31, 1998, at Bank One Ballpark before a standing-room only crowd of 50,179. Tickets had gone on sale on January 10 and sold out before lunch. The Rockies won, 9–2, with [[Andy Benes]] on the mound for the Diamondbacks, and [[Travis Lee]] being the first player to hit, score, homer and drive in a run.

In their first five seasons of existence, the Diamondbacks won three division titles (1999, 2001, 2002) and one [[World Series]] (2001). In 1999, [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona]] won 100 games in only its second season to win the NL West title. They lost to the [[1999 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in four games in the [[1999 National League Division Series|NLDS]].

Colangelo fired Showalter after a relatively disappointing 2000 season, and replaced him with [[Bob Brenly]], the former Giants catcher and coach, who had up to that point been working as a color analyst on Diamondbacks television broadcasts.

In 2001, the team was led by two of the most dominant pitchers in all of baseball: [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]]. Arizona had postseason victories over the [[2001 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] (3–2 in the [[2001 National League Division Series|NLDS]]) and the [[2001 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] (4–1 in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]) to advance to the World Series where, in [[2001 World Series|in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City]], they beat the reigning champions, the [[2001 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], 4 to 3, to become the youngest expansion franchise to win the World Series (in just their fourth season of play). This was the first time since {{World Series Year|1991}} that the home team won all seven games of a World Series and the first time that a National League team won a World Series in which the home team won all seven games of a World Series.

An estimated orderly crowd of over 300,000 celebrated at the Diamondbacks victory parade, held at Bank One Ballpark and the surrounding downtown Phoenix streets on November 7, 2001. This was the first major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona and the first for a team (in the four major North American professional sports leagues) owned or controlled by Colangelo, whose basketball Suns made it to the [[NBA Finals]] in [[1976 NBA Finals|1976]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]] but lost both times. (Colangelo's [[Arizona Rattlers]] won the [[Arena Football League (1987-2008)|Arena Football League]] championship in 1994 and 1997.) Colangelo’s willingness to go into debt and acquire players through free agency would ultimately lead to one of the quickest free falls in major sports history when in just three years, the Diamondbacks would record one of the worst losing records in all of major league baseball by losing 111 games.

The team won the NL West Division Title again in 2002, but were swept out in the [[2002 National League Division Series|NLDS]] by the [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].

===2003–05: Tough times and the end of the Colangelo era&amp;nbsp;— the fall===
By the 2004 season, however, the Diamondbacks had dropped to a dismal 51–111 record, the worst in [[Major League Baseball]] that year and also one of the 10 worst records in the past 100&amp;nbsp;years of MLB, despite Johnson pitching a [[perfect game]] on May 18 of that season. Brenly was fired partway through the season and was replaced on an interim basis by coach [[Al Pedrique]]. Before the season co-MVP (with Johnson) of the 2001 World Series [[Curt Schilling]] had been traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]], who won the World Series in [[2004 World Series|2004]] and [[2007 World Series|2007]].

By this time Colangelo and the other partners were embroiled in a dispute over the financial health and direction of the Diamondbacks (and notably including over $150&amp;nbsp;million in [[deferred compensation]] to many players who were key members of the 2001 World Series winning team and others). He was forced to resign his managing general partner post in the late summer of 2004.

Colangelo sold his interest in the General Partnership of the Diamondbacks to a group of investors who were all involved as partners in the founding of the team in 1995. The investors include equal partners [[Ken Kendrick]], Mike Chipman, and Jeffrey Royer. [[Jeff Moorad]], a former sports agent, joined the partnership, and was named the team's CEO; becoming its primary public face. Ken Kendrick became the managing general partner.

Colangelo was sharply criticized for plunging the team into over $150&amp;nbsp;million in debt to secure the services of expensive veterans in order to field a competitive team quickly. In a 2004 interview with columnist Hal Bodley of ''[[USA TODAY]]'', Colangelo defended his actions:

{{quote|I understand where some people felt I wasn't doing it appropriately. The only analogy I can use is that [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay]] (the other '98 expansion team) went one direction and where did they end up? (Six last-place finishes and low attendance)...We went another direction to establish a fan base because our investment was much larger than Tampa Bay's. And we put so much money into our own stadium ($130&amp;nbsp;million). After the first year and the decrease in season tickets, I was convinced we had to build a fan base ...We bought three division titles, a World Series and established a fan base ...

...I believe what we did will last a long, long time ...Right or wrong, a number of teams today are in the $50&amp;nbsp;million payroll range and competitive – Oakland, Minnesota, Texas are examples. Our goal was to get returns from our farm system. We built into our cash-flow that we would be paying out the deferments and that our payroll could drop to $50&amp;nbsp;million for a few years ...A few things hurt us ...The economy was bad, and I was hoping for more national money (from baseball's central fund) coming in.&lt;ref name=&quot;usetoday1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-08-09-bodley_x.htm|title=USAToday.com|publisher=USAToday.com|date=2004-08-09|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also a factor in Colangelo's leaving his post was his advancing age: Colangelo was 64&amp;nbsp;years of age in 2004, and had he not sold his sports franchises, upon his death, his family would have been faced with having to pay high estate taxes based on the value of the Diamondbacks as well as the Suns (which he sold to [[Robert Sarver]] in the spring of 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;bizjournals1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2004/03/08/daily15.html|title=Phoenix.Bizjournals.com|publisher=Phoenix.Bizjournals.com|date=2004-03-08|accessdate=2010-09-07|first=Daniel|last=Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2004 season, the Diamondbacks hired [[Wally Backman]] to be the team's manager. Backman was formerly manager of the Class A [[California League]] [[Lancaster JetHawks]], one of the Diamondbacks' [[minor-league baseball|minor-league]] affiliates. In a turn of events that proved to be a minor embarrassment for the reorganized ownership group, Backman was almost immediately fired after management learned, after the fact, of legal troubles and improprieties in Backman's past. Former [[Seattle Mariners]] manager and Diamondbacks bench coach [[Bob Melvin]] became the new manager after only a ten-day tenure for Backman.

[[File:Shawn Green.jpg |thumb|120x|[[Shawn Green]]]]
Following the Backman incident, the Diamondbacks spent heavily on free agents in order to re-build into a contender. The club signed 3B [[Troy Glaus]], P [[Russ Ortiz]], SS [[Royce Clayton]], and 2B [[Craig Counsell]], among others. They then traded [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]] to the [[New York Yankees]], for [[Javier Vazquez]], [[Dioner Navarro]], and [[Brad Halsey]]. They then turned around and dealt newly acquired catcher [[Dioner Navarro]] to the Dodgers for [[Shawn Green]], and sent [[Shea Hillenbrand]] to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Finally, they traded [[Casey Fossum]] to the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for [[José Cruz, Jr.]]

The [[2005 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]], led by Melvin, finished the 2005 season with a record of 77 wins and 85 losses. However, this was a 26-game improvement over 2004, and actually good enough for second place in the woefully weak NL West, five games behind the [[2005 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]].

The Diamondbacks were considered by some to be the favorite to win the division after spending big money on the aforementioned free agents; however, injuries hurt the team's chances of reaching its expected potential.

Starting pitcher [[Russ Ortiz|Ortiz]] was out for some time which really hurt the pitching staff. [[Troy Glaus|Glaus]] played with a hurt knee all season. Of all the free agents that signed before the season, no one had a better season than first baseman [[Tony Clark]]. Clark started the season as a bench player and ended the season starting and being an important part of the team. Clark was rewarded with a new contract at the end of the season.

In October 2005 the Diamondbacks hired 35-year-old [[Josh Byrnes]], assistant general manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]], to replace the outgoing Joe Garagiola, Jr. as Diamondbacks [[General Manager (baseball)|General Manager]]. Garagiola took a position in [[Major League Baseball]]'s main offices in New York City.

===2006–present: Rebuilt and reloaded===
{{main|2006 Arizona Diamondbacks season}}
In a weak NL West division, the Diamondbacks failed to improve on their 2005 performance, finishing fourth with a slightly worse record than the year before. The season did include two excellent individual performances, however. 2B [[Orlando Hudson]] became the recipient of his second career [[Gold Glove Award]], as announced on November 3. Hudson became only the sixth infielder in major league history to win a Gold Glove award in both the American and National Leagues. He first received the award after the 2005 season as a member of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and was traded to the Diamondbacks later that offseason. On November 14, it was announced that RHP [[Brandon Webb]] was the recipient of the [[Cy Young Award]] for the National League. Webb, a specialist in throwing the [[sinker (baseball)|sinkerball]], received 15 of 32 first-place votes in balloting by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]]. Webb went 16–8 with a 3.10 ERA and in the 2006 season was named to his first All-Star team. San Diego Padres relief pitcher [[Trevor Hoffman]] was second place in the voting with 12 first-place votes and 77 points.

In preparation for the next season, the Diamondbacks made several significant trades during the offseason. The Diamondbacks and Brewers made a trade on November 25, 2006. [[Johnny Estrada]], [[Greg Aquino]], and [[Claudio Vargas]] were dealt to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for [[Doug Davis (pitcher)|Doug Davis]], [[Dana Eveland]], and [[Dave Krynzel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mlb1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Steve Gilbert&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061125&amp;content_id=1745898&amp;vkey=news_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|title=MLB.com|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=2006-09-17|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday January 7, it was announced that Randy Johnson would return to the Diamondbacks on a two year contract, pending a physical. He was obtained from the Yankees in exchange for [[Luis Vizcaino]], [[Ross Ohlendorf]], [[Alberto Gonzalez (baseball player)|Alberto Gonzalez]] and Steven Jackson. The Yankees will pay $2&amp;nbsp;million of Johnson's $26&amp;nbsp;million salary. The Diamondbacks and [[Florida Marlins]] made a deal March 26 to acquire RHP [[Yusmeiro Petit]] in exchange for Jorge Julio and cash.

====2007: A new look and a return to the playoffs====
{{main|2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season}}
;Uniform and color change: Sedona Red
The Diamondbacks announced in early September 2006 that their uniforms, which remained largely unchanged since the team's first season, would be completely redesigned for the 2007 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlb2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Steve Gilbert&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060901&amp;content_id=1640230&amp;vkey=news_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|title=MLB.com|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details were supposed to be kept from the public until after the 2006 postseason as per MLB rules, but the Diamondback page from the 2007 MLB Official Style Guide was somehow leaked around September 25, and local media broadcast printed the new design for all to see. Of great surprise to many fans was a brand new color scheme; apparently the original colors used by the franchise since Major League Baseball awarded it to Jerry Colangelo's ownership group in 1995 were to be discontinued.

While some fans applauded the redesign, most of the reaction to the new color scheme, which included the changing of the historical purple and traditional Arizonan colors of [[copper]] and [[turquoise]] to a reddish color known as &quot;Sedona Red&quot; similar to that of the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]] color schemes, was pointedly negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;azcentral1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/0902dbacks-uniform0902-CP.html|title=AZCentral.com|publisher=AZCentral.com|date=2006-09-02|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;about1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.about.com/gi/pages/poll.htm?linkback=http://phoenix.about.com/b/a/257347.htm&amp;poll_id=7147081268|title=About.com|publisher=Phoenix.about.com|date=2010-04-02|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;azcentral2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/0926sports-toprail0926.html|title=AZCentral.com|publisher=AZCentral.com|date=2006-09-26|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fans{{Who|date=February 2011}} went so far as to call the 2007 D'Backs a new and completely different team, calling the 2007 season a &quot;re-inaugural year&quot;; some fans in [[Tucson]] had banners reading; &quot;Arizona Diamondbacks 1998–2006 – Arizona D'Backs 2007– &quot; or &quot;Exit Diamondbacks Enter D'Backs&quot; and &quot;Exit Purple Enter Sedona.&quot;

The official unveiling of the uniforms came at a charity event on November 8 in nearby Scottsdale, where several of the players modeled the uniforms on a runway, and posed for publicity photos.

The distinctive &quot;A&quot; design remained unchanged save for the colors. The stylized snake-like &quot;D&quot; logo, also used since the early days for the road uniforms, was slightly redesigned and a completely new shoulder patch introduced. The lettering on the jerseys was completely redesigned.

&quot;Sedona Red&quot; became the dominant color scheme used throughout Chase Field and in all marketing and promotional materials for the Diamondback ballclub.

;Changing faces and a successful season
Not only did the Diamondbacks uniforms change, but many faces of the organization changed as well. In addition to the trades detailed below:
*Fan favorite and Diamondbacks stalwart [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] did not return as the left fielder for the Diamondbacks. The most popular player in franchise history, &quot;Gonzo&quot; signed a one-year contract worth just under $7&amp;nbsp;million on December 7 to play for the rival [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for the 2007 season.
*[[Craig Counsell]], another popular player, signed a two-year contract with his hometown [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and did not return to the Diamondbacks in 2007.
*Pitcher [[Miguel Batista]] did not return in an Arizona uniform (he signed a three-year contract with the Mariners in December 2006).
*[[Jay Bell]], a longtime Diamondback as both a player and coach (he was on the inaugural 1998 expansion team, and his son Brently gave the [[List of Major League Baseball mascots#D. Baxter the Bobcat(Arizona)|team mascot]] its name of D. Baxter), relinquished his duties as bench coach to spend more time with family; he remained in the organization as an adviser to Bob Melvin.
*The original Diamondbacks [[play-by-play]] man [[Thom Brennaman]] moved on to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] organization to work with his father [[Marty Brennaman]] in the booth.

In the 2007 regular season, the Diamondbacks enjoyed a relatively high degree of success with a young team including [[Brandon Webb]], [[Conor Jackson]], [[Stephen Drew]], [[Carlos Quentin]], [[Chad Tracy]], [[Chris Young (baseball outfielder)|Chris Young]], [[Miguel Montero]], [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]] (called up from Double-A in May) and [[Justin Upton]] (called up from Double-A in August). The Diamondbacks in the regular season posted the best record in the NL with 90 wins and 72 losses. Despite their success, they were actually outscored by a cumulative total of 20 runs in their games.

;2007 postseason
On September 28, the Diamondbacks beat the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] to secure a position in the 2007 playoffs. After the Padres' defeat at the hands of the [[2007 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] on September 29, the Diamondbacks secured both the NL West title and home field throughout the NL playoffs.

After taking the first two games at home against the Cubs, in the [[2007 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]], they took the series to [[Wrigley Field]], where they completed their sweep, earning their first berth in the National League Championship Series since 2001.

In the [[2007 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] (where, ironically, they faced the Rockies), however, the D'Backs' bats&amp;nbsp;– and any sort of luck they had&amp;nbsp;– fell silent. Though the D'Backs' pitchers kept it close, they just didn't seem to get any kind of situational hitting. Plays in key situations- Upton's slide in Game 1, Stephen Drew's baserunning mistake and Valverde's 3 walks in a row, including a bases-loaded walk in the 10th in Game 2, [[Yorvit Torrealba]]'s homer in Game 3, Conor Jackson booting the ball in Game 4, and even into the 8th and 9th innings of the final game, with the D'Backs trailing by two, Tony Clark struck out leaving Upton at third base in the 8th, and in the 9th, Chris Young's leadoff double was wasted...the D'Backs ran out of momentum against a Colorado team who just couldn't lose and were swept by the Rockies.

The 2007 season overall was a great success.

;2007 offseason
On December 3, 2007 the Diamondbacks traded [[Carlos Quentin]] to the [[Chicago White Sox]] for first base prospect Chris Carter.

On December 14, in a blockbuster trade, the Diamondbacks acquired starting RHP [[Dan Haren]] from the [[Oakland Athletics]] for six players: LHP [[Brett Anderson (baseball)|Brett Anderson]], LHP [[Dana Eveland]] and LHP [[Greg Smith (pitcher)|Greg Smith]]; the above-mentioned just-acquired infielder Chris Carter; and outfielders [[Aaron Cunningham]] and [[Carlos González (baseball)|Carlos Gonzalez]]. The team also traded relief pitcher [[Jose Valverde]], who led the major leagues in saves in 2007 with 47, to the [[Houston Astros]] for reliever [[Chad Qualls]], RHP [[Juan Gutiérrez (baseball)|Juan Gutiérrez]] and IF/OF [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]]. (Valverde was expected to immediately become the Astros' closer.)

Haren was expected to immediately join the Diamondbacks starting rotation which will include Webb and hopefully [[Randy Johnson]] if he rehabilitates successfully from his season-ending back injuries (Johnson was acquired from the Yankees in January 2007 and had a strong start to the 2007 season before back problems forced him out in August).

Haren was 15–9 with a 3.07 ERA for Oakland in 2007. This move was expected to make the D'Backs favored to win the NL West in 2008 provided the offensive production is good.

Arizona was not able to re-sign veteran free agents [[Tony Clark]] and [[Livan Hernandez]], who were picked up by [[San Diego Padres|San Diego]] and [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota]], respectively. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

====2008 season====
{{main|2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season}}
After winning the opening game of the season on March 31 on the road against the [[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], the Diamondbacks found themselves with the best record in Major League Baseball, 20–8, by the start of May. At that time, they also led the NL West by 6.5 games. They lost the first series in May against the [[2007 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], the first series lost since the opening series against the Reds. The Diamondbacks continued to lead the NL West despite only being 47–48 at the All-Star break.

On July 17, 2008, [[Tony Clark]] was traded back to the D'Backs from the San Diego Padres for a minor league pitcher, [[Evan Scribner]].

On August 5, [[Dan Haren]] signed a four-year, $44.75&amp;nbsp;million deal with the Diamondbacks worth a guaranteed $41.25&amp;nbsp;million through 2012 and including a $15.5&amp;nbsp;million club option for 2013 with a $3.5&amp;nbsp;million buyout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2008/08/05/20080805dbharen-CR.html|title=D'Backs sign Haren through 2012|publisher=Azcentral.com|date=2008-08-05|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orlando Hudson]], one of the more consistent offensive D'Backs players in 2008, underwent season-ending surgery on his left wrist August 9 in the wake of a collision with catcher [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. Hudson was due to become a free agent at the end of the season and speculation at the time was that he would not be re-signed with the Diamondbacks, because he wanted a higher salary.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} (On February 21, 2009, Hudson signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, reportedly worth $3.4&amp;nbsp;million (with an additional $4.6&amp;nbsp;million more in performance bonuses).)

LF [[Eric Byrnes]] was on the 60-day disabled list from late June, with a torn left hamstring, and was out for the remainder of the season.

On August 11, 2008, [[Dallas Buck]], RHP [[Micah Owings]], and C [[Wilkin Castillo]] were traded to the Reds (in last place in the NL Central at the time) in exchange for OF [[Adam Dunn]]. Dunn, who was tied for the major league lead with 32 home runs, was expected to provide a significant boost to an offense that has struggled to score runs for most of the season. Dunn seemed quite positive about being traded to a ballclub in first place in its division in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2008/08/11/20080811dbacksdunn-CR.html|title=azcentral.com|publisher=azcentral.com|date=2008-08-11|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was seen by some fans{{Who|date=August 2008}} as a belated attempt by the D'Backs to counter the trade by their division rival, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], for [[Boston Red Sox]] power-hitting OF [[Manny Ramirez]] on July 31 and also to compensate for the injuries to Hudson and Byrnes, generally considered two of the more &quot;power-hitting&quot; Diamondbacks on a team which has relied heavily on pitching and defense in recent years. A free agent at the end of the season, on February 11, 2009, Dunn agreed to a two-year $20&amp;nbsp;million contract with the [[Washington Nationals]].

Owings, once considered an excellent pitching prospect for the Diamondbacks, struggled in the 2008 campaign with a 7.09 ERA after April 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2008/08/12/20080812spt-owings.html|title=azcentral.com|publisher=azcentral.com|date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, the Diamondbacks acquired former World Series MVP [[David Eckstein]] to fill the hole at secondbase which was opened after Orlando Hudson was placed on the disabled list. Eckstein was traded from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for Minor League pitcher Chad Beck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Mike Ritter&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080831&amp;content_id=3398057&amp;vkey=news_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|title=D'Backs net Eckstein from Jays for arm &amp;#124; dbacks.com: News|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a less successful last half of the season, they finished with a record of 82–80 which dethroned them of the NL West Champions sitting them at 2nd place behind the [[2008 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]].

====2009 season====
{{main|2009 Arizona Diamondbacks season}}
On May 8, after going 12–17 in 29 games, the Diamondbacks let manager [[Bob Melvin]] go and hired [[A. J. Hinch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Gilbert|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=D'Backs name Hinch to replace Melvin|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090507&amp;content_id=4614902&amp;vkey=news_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari|work=|publisher=MLB.com|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended with the Diamondbacks in last place and a record of 70 wins and 92 losses (.432 winning percentage). They played almost as well on the road as they did at home, going 34–47 on the road, while finishing 36–45 at home. The Diamondbacks' tough year was blamed on a struggling offense (who had a collective .224 batting average), and even more so on an inadequate pitching staff, which had a collective ERA (Earned Run Average) of 4.18.

====2010 Season====
{{main|2010 Arizona Diamondbacks season}}
The Diamondbacks continued to struggle during the 2010 season, ending the season with a 65–97 record (.401 winning percentage) in the basement of the NL West. On July 1, general manager [[Josh Byrnes]] and manager [[A. J. Hinch]] were fired and replaced on an interim basis by [[Jerry Dipoto]] and [[Kirk Gibson]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/sports/articles/2010/07/01/20100701diamondbacks-fire-aj-hinch-josh-byrnes.html|title=Diamondbacks fire Josh Byrnes, A.J. Hinch|publisher=AZCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Gibson was later named the manager on a permanent basis, but Dipoto was replaced by [[Kevin Towers]]) The Diamondbacks set a new MLB record for strikeouts in a season, breaking the record on September 21&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Big-Whiffas-D-Backs-set-season-strikeout-record?urn=mlb-271540 Big Whiffas!D'Backs set season strikeout record with 1,403 Ks]&lt;/ref&gt; and ending the season with 1,529.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ARI/2010.shtml 2010 Team Stats]&lt;/ref&gt; A significant weakness on the 2010 club was the bullpen, which finished with a collective 5.47 ERA.

==Diamondbacks broadcasters==
The primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was [[Thom Brennaman]], who also broadcasts baseball and [[college football]] games nationally for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Television]]. Brennaman was the TV announcer for the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (along with his father [[Marty Brennaman]]) before being hired by Diamondbacks founder Jerry Colangelo in 1996, two years before the team would begin play.

In October 2006, Brennaman left the Diamondbacks to call games with his father for the Reds beginning in 2007, signing a 4-year deal (his FOX duties remained unchanged).

The English language flagship radio station is [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]]. [[Greg Schulte]] is the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well-known for his previous work on Phoenix Suns, [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Ari
